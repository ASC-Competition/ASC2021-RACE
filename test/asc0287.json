  "article": "\"I'm so sorry. It was all my fault, with no excuse and no reason,\" said the 23-year-old Taiwan actor, Kai Ko or Ko Chen-tung  , bowing to the press conference  . Ko apologized publically for taking drugs   with friends at his house in Beijing\"It was my personal behavior, selfish and stupid. I cannot go back in time to undo what I did, but there is willingness to correct a mistake. I want to correct my mistake, because I don't want to see the sad faces of those who love me and those who I love. I am really sorry to them.\"Ko said.\nKo became very famous and popular after starring in the film called You Are the Apple of My Eye in 2011. His clean and youthful image won him many fans. For those fans, they are willing to trust Ko. By the end of the 10-minute press conference, 3,207 users of Sina Weibo   supported Ko and hoped he would be a better person in the future.\nHowever, there were other voices. Wang Zhuo, a user of Sina Weibo said, \" It doesn't matter whether he apologizes or not, because nobody cares. Showbiz and the arts industry   will not use anyone like him from now on anyway.\" Another user said, \"After 14 days of detention  , Ko's acting skills grew a lot!\"\nWhen asked what his plans are after he regained freedom, Ko said he would continue to cooperate with the police on further investigations   after returning to Taiwan.",
