  "article": "Dan was the doorman of a club in a big city. Every day, thousands of people passed his door, and a lot of them stopped and asked him, \"What's the time, please?\"\nAfter a few months, Dan said to himself, \"I'm not going to answer all those stupid people any more. I'm going to buy a big clock and put it on the wall here.\" Then he did so.\n\"Now people aren't going to stop and ask me the time.\" He thought happily.\nBut after that, a lot of people stopped, looked at the clock and asked Dan, \"Is that clock right?\"",
