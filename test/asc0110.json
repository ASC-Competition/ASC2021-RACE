  "article": "Little Tom down the street calls our dog \"The keep dog\".Zip is a sheep dog. But when Tom tries to say\" Seep\", it comes out \"keep\". And in a way Tom is right. Zip is always bringing things home for us to keep! I'll tell you about some of them.\nZip's first present was a shoe. It was made of green silk.\nWe didn't know how Zip found the shoe. But after a moment Mary, my big sister, told me the shoe had a strange smell. I nodded and held my nose. \"What do you think it is?\"\n\"It smells like something for cleaning. I think someone tried to clean a spot   off the shoe. Then he put it at the door to dry.\"\n\"Along came Zip. And good-bye shoe!\" I said.\"We should take it back.\"\n\"We can't \".said my sistter.\n\"Maybe little Tom is right,\" Mary said. \"Maybe Zip is a keep dog!\"",
