  "article": "I recall a moment that I experienced with my dad when I was twenty-one. I was going to college and living with a couple of friends in Chicago.\nWhen the car I was using died, my dad, realizing that I needed transportation to get to work and to school, was good enough to lend me the money for a used car. Shortly after I bought it, my parents drove down to San Diego for the winter. Before they left, my dad gave me some of his bank deposit slips   with clear and detailed instructions to put one hundred dollars of my earnings, every payday, into their savings account while they were gone.\nAt that time of my life, I was not yet clear about what were the most important problems that I had to attend to first. I dismissed our agreement as nothing important and continued to spend my money as fast as I was making it, in pubs, on dates, and so on. Instead of honoring our agreement, I made payments that were less than the agreed-upon amounts, and on more than one occasion I made no payment at all. \nWhen my parents arrived home in late March, I got a call from my dad, who said, \"Don't go anywhere. I'm coming over.\" My dad was (and still is) a physical presence and had been a truck driver for thirty-five years. I felt ashamed and guilty, knowing that Dad had discovered that I hadn't held up my end of our bargain. \nAfter he came in, he told me to sit down because he had a few things to tell me. There was no shouting, no red face with a vein about to burst on his forehead, and no bad language at all. His first words were, \"When your mother and I got back into town yesterday, I called the bank. I can't say I was surprised to discover that you hadn't made all the payments. My first thought was to come here and take the car from you, but I want to tell you some things while I'm here. Maybe you'll understand, and maybe you won't.\"\nHe went on to tell me, very calmly, about what it means to keep your word. He explained that when he was growing up after the Depression, a man's handshake and his word meant everything. He also told me that because I was twenty-one, he didn't feel angry so much as sad and disappointed. He closed by saying that our words and actions have a real effect on others, and that my words and actions were what others would measure me by. He added that if I hadn't yet formed some core or basic values and principles, this might be a good time to start thinking about those things.\nFor the first time, I saw real disappointment on Dad's face.\nHe gave me a second chance to make our deal right, and even gave me more deposit slips, saying, \"I will take those keys if you miss a single payment or, at the very least, if you don't let me know in advance that you'll have trouble making a payment.  _ .\"\nHe spoke for about forty-five minutes, and I listened. He didn't expect me to say much, and I knew enough to keep quiet. I just nodded or shook my head at the right time and continued to listen.\nThat time we spent together changed me forever. Then and there, I made a promise to myself that I'd never again be the cause of that look of sadness and disappointment on Dad's face. After that defining afternoon, our relationship got better and better. I'm now married with two sons of my own, and they're already learning about the importance of honor, trust, and honesty.",
