  "article": "Starting college can be a difficult experience. You have to deal with new responsibilities, growing independence, a challenging course load, and of course, the social scene. When a roommate is thrown into the mix, it may feel like you're struggling with all that stuff while living in a small box with a stranger.\nBut having a roommate doesn't need to be one more thing to worry about. When students go into their living situations with realistic expectations and a willingness to  _ , things can work out just fine.\nWhen you first meet your roommate, chances are that you'll be on your best behavior. You want to get along since this is the person who's going to be sharing your living space for the next year. But try to think ahead to potential worst cases, too.\nFor example, imagine it's 2 am and you're working on a paper that's due in 8 hours. Your roommate comes in from a party and wants to continue the party in your room.\nAt times like these, you can't be feeling good. That's why talking about issues that might come up ahead of time and respecting each other's wishes when the time comes is so important.\nTalk about the things that are really important to you, and make sure your roommate understands. Then encourage him or her to do the same.\nFor instance, does it make you angry when people take things without asking first? Let your roommate know your feelings about these types of things from the start. There are some things to talk to your roommate about so that both of you have a feel for each other's likes, dislikes and habits.",
