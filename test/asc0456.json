  "article": "A story is told about a soldier who was finally coming home after having fought in Vietnam. He called his parents from San Francisco.\n\"Mom and Dad, I'm coming home, but I have a friend I'd like to bring with me.\"\n\"Sure,\" they replied, \"we'd love to meet him.\"\n\"There is something you should know,\" the son continued, \" he was hurt badly in the fighting. He lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go, and I want him to live with us.\"\n\"I'm sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live.\"\n\"No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us.\"\n\"Son,\" said the father, \"you don't know what you're asking. Someone like the young man would be a terrible burden for us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let something like this stay with our lives. I think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He'll find a way to live on his own.\"\nAt that point, the son hung up the phone. A few days later, however, they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling down from a building. The police believed it was suicide .\nThe parents flew to San Francisco. To their surprise, they found their son had only one arm and one leg.\nThe parents in this story are like many of us. We find it easy to love those who are good-looking or fun, but we don't like people who make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay away from people who aren't as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are.",
