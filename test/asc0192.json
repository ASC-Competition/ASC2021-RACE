  "article": "School is out for the summer in some areas, and for many children, that means weeks of sleeping in late, trips to the swimming pool or hours spent in front of the TV. These months of inactivity--- away from the daily tiring things of school--- are something that young people look forward to, but it can have a detrimental influence on the knowledge they have.\nStudies have shown that children lose a lot in math skills during the summer months. Children who spend little time learning experience a much greater amount of learning loss than those who often take part in summer programs.\nSo when school starts again in the fall, teachers often have to spend several weeks reteaching children material that they have forgotten.\nExperts suggest that parents make sure the summer months are a time of continued learning. For example, they suggest that lunch time is good time to improve a child's spoken skills, simply through conversation. A trip to the supermarket can be an opportunity to improve a child's math skills by having him or her add up the cost of food. And there is no better way to prevent learning loss than by having a child read every day.\nFortunately, there are many programs that can help parents. The best place to start is at your local library. Most libraries have summer reading programs that are filled with fun activities. A. strong musical education also improves learning. Find out summer music camps in your area.\nWe think that children should have fun during the summer break, but it should not be a vacation from learning. We strongly suggest parents should take advantage of the many educational opportunities available for their children during the coming weeks.",
