More than 2,000 people visited the northern Alaska village of Kaktovik in 2018 to see polar bears in the wild. The far north community lies in an area where increasingly higher temperature has sped up the movement of sea ice, the primary habitat of polar bears. As ice has gradually moved to deep water beyond the continental shelf, more bears are remaining on land to look for food. Polar bears have always been a common sight on sea ice near Kaktovik, but villagers started noticing a change in the mid\u00ad1990s. More bears seemed to stay on land, and researchers began taking note of more female bears making homes in the snow on land instead of on the ice to raise their babies. U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists began hearing reports of the increasing number of polar bears in the area in the early 2000s. As more attention was given to the plight of polar bears about a decade ago, more tourists started heading to Kaktovik. The village had fewer than 50 visitors annually before 2011, said Jennifer Reed, of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \" Today we're talking about hundreds and hundreds of visitors, many from around the world each year, \" Reed said. Most tourists visit in the fall, when bears are forced toward land because sea ice is farthest away from the shore. Bruce Inglangasak, a local hunter who sometimes offers wildlife\u00ad viewing tours, said he's been offering polar bear tours since 2004. Most of his clients are from China and Europe, as well as from the lower 48 U. S. states. Many tourists stay several days in the village, which has two small hotels. The villagers have benefited a lot from that. In turn, they provide more effective protection for polar bears with financial support from tourism development.",
