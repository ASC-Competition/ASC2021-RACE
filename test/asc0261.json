  "article": "We were onthe way from Hutchinson to Chicago for a short spring break. For many years Ihad wanted to take my family on the train. We all went to Chicago four yearsago, and the kids loved it. Chicago is one of my favorite cities, too, so thethought struck me again last fall to ride the train to Chicago. Of course,flying would have been faster. But I don't think flying is easier, especiallythese days, with all the security and waiting in lines at airports.Though wewere tired in the middle of the night, the kids got on the train with the exhilarationof this adventure. \" We're moving, \" my son William shouted happilywith big eyes as the train began to pull away from the Hutchinson station.I removed myshoes and lay down to try to finish my night's sleep. The sleeper car wouldhave better enabled that, but the ordinary train seats were not too bad. Anairline flight is a more miserable experience for me\uff1anot enough room, two hours of pain with my knees almost touching mychin, the hard seatback in front cracking my kneecaps with every move of the body planted in front of me. On the train Icould almost outstretch all of my 6\u00adfoot\u00ad2\u00adplus body in the generous legroom.The journeydidn't feel at all as long as it was. We all found the train ride a joy. Thecar ride would have felt every minute of 13 hours. But on the train you arefree to walk around, sit in the observation carriage for a while and enjoy thescenery out the windows, have a nice meal in the dining car, read a book, orplay a board game.In short, thetrain is all about enjoying the trip, which isn't something I do so much whentravelling by airline or by car, when the trip seems more of a mission to get there than an experience to enjoy along the way.Chicagooffers much to do for a family. This time, getting there was half the fun.",
