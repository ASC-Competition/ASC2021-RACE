  "article": "There are many acceptable varieties of English throughout the world. Whichever variety is used in your country, the most important thing is that students' pronunciation must be good enough for another person to understand what they are trying to say.\nIn a PPP lesson, teachers naturally include a good model of the pronunciation when they are presenting new vocabulary, grammar or functional language. It is important to start by helping your students recognize sounds before you expect them to produce them.\nSpoken British English has 44 sounds, but there are only 26 letters in the alphabet for written English. This sometimes makes English pronunciation and spelling different, so it is not always best to write words on the blackboard at the early stages. Also, some sounds in English do not exist in some other languages. This can make it very difficult for students to recognize these sounds and even more difficult for them to pronounce them correctly. So some students need to do a lot of work on these sounds, listening to them, trying to recognize them and trying to copy them.\nIf you can understand and pronounce the symbols of the phonetic alphabet, this will help you to pronounce any word in the dictionary. You can teach this phonetic alphabet to your students and this will make teaching pronunciation much easier. However, you can teach pronunciation effectively without knowing the phonetic alphabet. Pronouncing English well is not just about getting the individual sounds right. Students need to know:\n* which parts of a word are stressed (spoken louder and longer);\n* which parts of a sentence are stressed;\n* basic intonation patterns;\n* what it means when we change the intonation in a sentence (the music of the language);\n* how to link together the sounds within a sentence.\nStudents need practice in all these areas to improve their pronunciation.",
