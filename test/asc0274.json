  "article": "Usually, students are not encouraged to run or jump around in the corridor  . However, students in a British grammar school really enjoy running on the corridor tiles   and their teachers even encourage them to do that.\nWhy? It is because the corridor was built with special kinetic   tiles. When students jump on the tiles, electricity will be produced. After one year, the electricity produced from the tiles can fully charge 853 mobile phones or power  an electric car to drive seven miles. It's amazing, isn't it?\nThe corridor tiles are really a brilliant invention. Students can not only play on the corridor, but also help power the lights in their school corridors and other equipment in their classrooms. Besides, this is a good way to teach students to be creative. They will be _ to be scientists, inventors and engineers in the future to find clean energy for all humans.\nThe inventor of the magic corridor tiles is Laurence Kemball-Cook. He was once a student in this school. Now, he is CEO of his own company. The corridor tiles are not Laurence's only invention. He has also invented a special dance floor, which can be used at music festivals. It allows dancers to charge their mobile phones while they are dancing on the dance floor.",
