  "article": "For Chinese, it's a time for dragon boat racing and Zongzi . But across the Yellow Sea, South Korea, wrestling and swing play are the highlights. However, both events go by the same name\u2014the Dragon Boat Festival\u2014which falls on May5 of the lunar calendar. One festival, two cultures: does one nation have the right to call its own? It has been reported that South Korea will apply to the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization to make the celebration its cultural heritage . If successful, people from other countries may see the Dragon Festival as a Korean creation. As the birthplace of the yearly event more than 2,000 years ago, China is not happy with the situation. \" It would be a shame if another country successfully made a traditional Chinese festival part of its own cultural heritage ahead of China, \" said Zhou Heping, deputy culture minister. The Ministry of Culture is even thinking of making its own application to UNESCO, covering all traditional Chinese festivals, including the Dragon Boat event. Over the years, the Dragon Boat Festival has spread throughout the world. In Japan and Viet Nam, as well as South Korea, the festival has mixed with and become part of local culture. With this in mind, some experts say that it is meaningless to argue about which country the festival belongs to. \" No one can deny that it came from China, \" said Long Haiqing, an expert from Hunan Province. \" But if all the countries involved can protect culture heritage together, they will all benefit. \" ",
