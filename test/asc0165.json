  "article": "Nick Vujicic was born with no arms or legs, but he doesn't let this stop him. \n         The brave 26-year-old man plays football and golf, and swims, in spite of the fact that he has no arms or legs. \n         Nick has a small foot on his left side, which helps him balance and makes him able to kick. He uses his one foot to type, write with a pen and pick things up. \n         \"I call it my chicken drumstick  ,\" joked Nick, who was born in Melbourne, Australia, but now lives in Los Angeles. \"I'd be lost without it. When I get in the water I float because 80 percent of my body is lungs and my drumstick acts as a propeller  .\"\n         \"He's very modest, but he gets marriage proposals   from women all the time,\" said Nick's friend Steve Appel.\n         \"He would love to get married and start a family, but he's waiting for the right girl to come along.\"\n         When Nick was born his father was so shocked that he left the hospital room. His  _ mother couldn't bring herself to hold him until he was four months old.\n         His disability came without any medical explanation, which was a rare case. Nick and his parents spent many years asking why this cruel trick would happen to them. \n         \"My mother was a nurse and she did everything right during pregnancy but she still blamed herself,\" he said.\n         \"It was so hard for them, but right from the start they did their best to make me independent. My dad put me in the water at 18 months and gave me the courage to learn how to swim.\"",
