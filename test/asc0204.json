  "article": "Rob Coulter worked in the wild of South Africa. He knew the animals, insects, and reptiles of Africa very well. Rob knew them so well that he became careless. \n   One night, while camping alone, Rob reached out to pick up a large piece of wood and felt something bite his arm. Rob didn't think much about it. But a little later, his arm began to ache. When he looked closely at it, he immediately saw two teeth marks in the skin of his arm. He realized that a poisonous snake had bitten him. His pulse became rapid. \n   Rob's mind raced as he thought about what he had to do to survive. Rob knew that he should remain calm, stay still, keep the injured arm below the level of his heart and avoid eating or drinking anything, especially anything with alcohol in it. He also knew that cutting the wound to suck the poison out was a bad idea. \n   He used his two-way radio to call for help. As he waited, he washed the bite with soap and water. To help slow the spread of the venom , he wrapped a bandage two inches above the bite and made it loose enough to slip a finger under it so that it would not cut off the flow of blood. Then, after about half an hour, his friend Mike arrived. Mike took Rob to the local hospital, where Rob was given antivenin--an antidote for snake venom. \n   Rob still enjoys camping, but he is now very careful not to disturb snakes.",
