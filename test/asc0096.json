  "article": "Love Is Just a Thread\n     Sometimes I really doubt whether there is love between my parents.Every day they are very busy trying to earn money to pay the high tuition for us.They don't act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV.\" I love you\" is too luxurious for them to say .Sending flowers to each other on Valentine's Day is even more  _ .My father is easy to lose his temper, especially when he's very tired from the hard work.\n     One day, my mother was sewing a quilt.I silently sat beside her and asked her if there was love between them.\" What?\" she replied, still doing her work.My mother stopped her work and raised her head with surprise.She didn't answer immediately.Then she bowed her head and continued sewing the quilt.I was in a great embarrassment and I didn't know what to do.But at last I heard my mother say the following words: \" Look at this thread.Sometimes it appears, but most of it disappears in the quilt.The thread really makes the quilt strong and durable.If life is a quilt, then love should be a thread.It can hardly be seen anywhere or anytime, but it's really there.Love is inside.\" I listened carefully but I couldn't understand her until the next spring.\n      My father suddenly got sick seriously.My mother had to stay with him in the hospital for a month.When they returned from the hospital, they both seemed as if they had a serious illness.Every day in the morning and dusk, my mother helped my father walk slowly on the country road.It seemed they were the most harmonious couple.There were many beautiful flowers, green grass and trees, and the sun gently glistened  through the leaves.All of these made up the most beautiful picture in the world.When we were worrying about him, he said gently: \" I really like walking with your mom.I like this kind of life.\" Reading his eyes, I know he loves my mother deeply.\n       Once I thought love meant flowers, gifts and sweet kisses.But from this experience, I understand that love is just a thread in the quilt of our life.Love is inside, making life strong and warm.",
