  "article": "The idea behind Facebook is to make us feel connected all the time. But in my research, I've found that the truth is quiet different. Technology, it turns out, has made being alone seem like a problem that needs soling. When young people are alone, even for a minute or two, they feel the need to connect to get on Facebook or some other social networks and chat. But in connecting, they often end up feeling more isolated. Why? Because by being in constant connection, they lose the ability to feel satisfied with their own company . Facebook can help us keep in touch with our friends, but we too often use it instead of spending face to face time with them. And since we feel the need to keep up with them online, we don't have moments of loneliness where we can collect our thoughts and learn how to be comfortable being alone. \u2014\u2014Sherry Turkle, Profescer Facebook connects more of us to more of our friends and family in more places than we have ever been connected before. Yes. Facebook is a huge time sink -maybe the biggest ever. Many people post useless stuff. And seeing too much of your friends lives can make you jealous , but it won't make you lonely. Jane, a former student of mine, who is back in New York after living abroad for ten years told me that Facebook helps her a lot. The first time she moved back to New York from abroad, she felt disconnected from her family and friends. now because of lots of photos and information updates , she knows what is happening with her friends all the time. In fact, if you are lonely in real life, you will be lonely online as well. \u2014\u2014Sree Steniveasan, Chief Digital office",
