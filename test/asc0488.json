If the decision is up to Carol Dweck, the answer would likely be no. She's a psychology professor at Stanford University, California. She says a player doesn't have to be the best to get a trophy. But those who receive an award should have to work for it. She suggests trophies go to the most improved player, or the one who contributed most to the team spirit, as well as to those who play the best. \" The trophy has to stand for something\uff0c \" Dweck told TFK. \" If we give a trophy to everyone, then the award has no value. \" Dweck argues that giving kids trophies for particular reasons, such as improving in a sport, and teaches kids that adults value hard work and trying our best. Others say that there's no harm in giving awards to all kids who play a sport, regardless of how they played or whether or not they improved. \" I think we should encourage kids' participation in sports\uff0c \" says Kenneth Barish, a psychology professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, in New York City. \" A trophy is one way to encourage kids' efforts. \" Barish argues that when we only single out the best or even the most improved players with a trophy, we are teaching kids the wrong lesson. We are sending the message that winning is everything. \" Winning is only part of the equation\uff0c \" Barish told TFK. \" Playing sports also teaches kids about teamwork and the importance of exercise. \" There will be plenty of opportunities for kids to learn about competition as they get older, says Barish. They'll soon realize that only one soccer team wins the World Cup and only one football team wins the Super Bowl. For now, he thinks there's nothing wrong with letting all kids who play a sport feel like winners. That means trophies for everyone.",
