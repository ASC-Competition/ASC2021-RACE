That is a new solution to laptop computer theft: a program that lets owners give their property a voice when it has been taken. The program allows users to display alerts on the missing computer's screen and even to set a spoken message. Tracking software for stolen laptops has been on the market for some time, but this is thought to be the first that allows owners to give the thief a piece of their mind. Owners must report their laptop missing by visiting a website, which sends a message to the model: a red and yellow \" lost or stolen \" sign appears on its screen when it is started.Under the latest version of the software, users can also send a spoken message. The message can be set to reappear every 30 seconds, no matter how many times the thief closes it. \" One customer sent a message saying, ' You are being tracked. I am right at your door ', \" said Carrie Hafeman, chief executive of the comp any which produces the program, Retriever. In the latest version, people can add a spoken message. For example, the laptop's speakers will say: \" Help, this laptop is reported lost or stolen. If you are not my owner, report me now. \" The Retriever software package, which costs $ 29.95 but has a free trial period, has the functions of many security software programs. Owners can remotely switch to an alternative password if they fear that the thief has also got hold of the access details. If a thief accesses the internet with the stolen laptop, Retriever will collect information on the internet service provider in use, so that the police can be alerted to its location. Thousands of laptops are stolen every year from homes and offices, but with the use of laptops increasing, the number stolen while their owners are out and about has been rising sharply. \u200bOther security software allows users to erase data remotely or lock down thecomputer.",
