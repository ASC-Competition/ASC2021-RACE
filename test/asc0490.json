That certainly sounds like a better day out. Nine deer were introduced into the Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, on Sept. 26 and would make it their home until February. The beautiful animals are part of an exhibition on deer-related relics, including furniture, clothes and artworks. In ancient China, deer patterns could be seen on lots of items since lu\u2014deer\u2014were considered to be a lucky animal because the Chinese word shares the pronunciation of the character that means \" official salary \" . The deer in the Palace Museum are not only to be part of the exhibition, but also to act as ambassadors to attract visitors. \" It's a better way to bring cultural relics closer to the people, \" explained Wang Yamin, a deputy director at the Museum, according to ChinaDaily. Turning itself into a zoo is the latest effort that the museum has made at introducing academic art to ordinary people. In 2014, for example, the museum's online store started to offer products such as T-shirts featuring the pattern of an emperor's coat, and earphones looking like the necklaces worn by ancient officials. These products soon gained popularity on social media because they allowed people to wear a piece of history. Two years later, the TV series MastersintheForbiddenCity lifted the mysterious veil on the experts who work in the museum\u2014people whose job is to repair the relics within it. And while many of us may have imagined these workers to be old and boring, they're actually quite young and interesting. Some are even in their 20s. They lead a peaceful career, although it can sometimes be dull. Workers aren't allowed to wear any make-up or do their nails because the chemicals may damage the relics they're working on, for example. Little by little, the Palace Museum is shaking off the stereotypes of being an old-fashioned academic institution. As Shan Jixiang, the museum's director, once said, \" Academic research is not alien from the public's interest. We'd like to make visiting the museum a part of people's daily lives. \" It looks like the Forbidden City isn't so forbidden after all.",
