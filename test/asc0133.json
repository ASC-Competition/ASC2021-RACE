  "article": "The challenge to drink to the limits of one's endurance has become a celebrated part of college life. In one of the most extensive reports on college drinking thus far, a 1997 Harvard School of Public Health study found that 43 percent of college students admitted binge drinking in the preceding two weeks (Defined as four drinks in a sitting for a woman and five of a man, a drinking binge is when one drinks enough to risk health and well - being )\nExperts estimate that excessive drinking is involved in thousands of student deaths a year. And the Harvard researchers found that there has been a dramatic change in why students drink. 39 percent drank \"to get drunk\" in 1993, but 52 percent had the same objective in 1997.\n\"What has changed is the across - the - board acceptability of intoxication  ,\" says Felix Savino at UW - Madison. Many college students today see not just drinking but being drunk as their primary way of socializing.\nThe reasons for the shift are complex and not fully understood. But researchers guess that it may have something to do with today's instant - satisfaction life - style--and young people tend to take into the extreme.\nWhile binge drinking isn't always deadly, it does have other, wide - ranging effects. Academics is one area where it takes a heavy  _ (something paid, lost or suffered). Perhaps because alcohol increases aggression and affects judgement, it is also related to 25 percent of violent crimes and roughly 60 percent of vandalism on campus. Facing the many potential dangers, college campuses are searching for ways to reduce binge drinking.",
