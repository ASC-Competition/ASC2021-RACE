  "article": "I was at a busy traffic crossing waiting to cross to the other side. There was a family--a man, his wife and an old lady, waiting to cross with me.\nThen, the light turned green and all of us walked quickly across the road. The light lasted very short, and changed into red in no time. I noticed that both the man and his wife had crossed along with me and the old lady was left behind. I quickly realized what happened.\nWhen the light turned dreen again, I ran over to the other side, offered the old lady my right hand and we quickly walked together to the other side of the road. I used my left hand to stop any oncoming   traffic so that even if the crossing signal turned red, we cuold make it to the other side safely. In the meantime, both the man and his wife realized that they had left the old woman behind and they ran back.. The old lady was in tears and told me, \"Young man, you are more caring   than my son,\" and then gave me a warm handshake  . The man and woman were sorry about what happened and also thanked me. Before leaving, the old lady gave me a big smile, which I have cherished   even to this day. She kept waving and waving until we couldn't see each other any more.",
