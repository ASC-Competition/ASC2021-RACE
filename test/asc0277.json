  "article": "When he was a teenager, Hunter Adam was very unhappy and he spent many years in a special hospital for people with mental health problems.\nWhen he left the hospital, Adam decided to become a doctor, so he went to a medical school in Virginia, USA. But when he was there, he did things in a different way. For example, he didn't like the doctor's white coats, so he wore shirts with flowers on them when he visited his patients and he tried to make them laugh. The doctors at the medical school didn't like Adams because he was too different.\nBut Adams believed that people in hospital need more than medicine. He saw unhappy and lonely people, and he tried to help them as patients, but as people too. He spent a lot of time with children in the hospital and often dressed up like a clown to make the children laugh\nWhen he finished medical school and become a doctor, Adams opened his own hospital, called \"the Gusundheit Institute\",together with some other doctors. They wanted it to be a place with a different way of working with sick people.\nHunter Adams became famous during the 1980s, and in 1988, Universal Pictures made a film about his life. It was very successful. In the film, Robin Williams played Adams. Williams said,:\"hunter is a really warm person, who believes that patients need a doctor who is a friend. I enjoyed playing him.\"",
