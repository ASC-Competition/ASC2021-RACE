  "article": "Every child has written their names on the beach at some point.\nBut whereas most people's \"handwriting\" is washed away, one super-rich Arab sheikh  has ensure that his graffiti  will last a little longer.\nHamad Bin Hamdan Al Nahyan, 63, has scrawled his name in sand on an island he owns with letters so big that they be seen from space.\nThe word \"HAMAD\" measures 1,000 meters high and is a staggering two miles long from the \"H\" to the \"D\" on the Al Futaisi Island.\nAnd rather than allow the writing to be washed away by the ocean, the letters actually form waterways that absorb the encroaching  tide. The ruler's name is even visible on Google's map service.\nHamad dreamed up the idea and had his workmen work hard for weeks to craft the enormous piece of sand graffiti. It is not known how much it cost to make.\nHowever, the sheikh boasts a personal fortune second to the Saudi king's.\nHamad, also known as the \"Rainbow Sheikh\", is a member of the Abu Dhabi Ruling Family.\nHe is understood to have some 200 cars including seven Mercedes 500 SELs painted in different colors of the rainbow which he stores in a giant pyramid.\nThe Arab sheikh had a taste for doing things on a large scale. He built the world's largest truck--eight times the size of the Dodge Power Wagon, with four bedrooms inside the cabin.\nHamad constructed a motor home in the shape of a giant globe which is exactly 1 millionth the size of the actual earth.\nAlongside his displays of wealth he has become a well-known philanthropist  in medicine and supplied a complete Kinney stone operating theatre to a public hospital in Morocco where he continues to fund its stuff.",
