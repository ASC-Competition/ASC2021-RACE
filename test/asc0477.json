  "article": "Sometimes it may seem difficult to improve our health. If so, the following health habits may help you.\nEat breakfast every morning.\nResearch shows that if you eat a meal in the morning you may not become too fat or eat too much during lunch. Eating breakfast can help people feel better through the day.\nGet enough sleep.\nPoor sleep can influence our memory and learning. It can also cause traffic accidents! Studies show that people who don't get enough sleep seem to get into more accidents. So stay safe and get enough sleep!\nTake a walk every day.\nWalking is an easy way to exercise. You'd better meet friends for a walk, not for a meal. As you walk, you will see the beautiful world around you. Once you try, you will find that adding a walk into your daily life is very easy.\nJoin social groups.\nSocial groups can provide support. They might include sport teams, art or music groups. The people in the group can offer advice and can help each other in difficult times. Also, being in a group keeps your mind busy. An active mind is a healthy mind!\nHave a hobby.\nA hobby could be running reading or making something with your hands. Hobbies help people to relax and rest. Hobbies bring us joy as well.\n,A, B, C, D ,.",
