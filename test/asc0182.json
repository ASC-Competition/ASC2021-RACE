  "article": "Think of London and you're likely to think of the city's famous bright red double-deckers buses. Think of Thailand's capital city, Bangkok, and the noisy tuk-tuk ( ) may come to mind. Picture the American city of San Francisco and you might see the city's trolleybuses.\nImagining what these cities would look like without their red buses, tuk-tuks or trolleybuses is difficult. They are symbols of these cities that make them different from anywhere else in the world. However, these city symbols, which are so loved by tourists, are not always so well loved by their city leaders. City leaders want what is best for their city, which often means the most modern transport.\nIn Thailand, Bangkok city authorities have forbidden new tuk-tuks because they consider them noisy and polluting. However, the ban has largely been unsuccessful, as it has not changed Thai people's preference for the inexpensive tuk-tuks over taxis.\nIn London, the city's first ever mayor got rid of the red double-decker buses, which he thought were old-fashioned, by selling them to other countries. His plan worked, but Londoners were upset to lose the charming old buses they believed represented the best of their city. They made their upset felt, when the major came up for re-election last year. Most Londoners voted for his competitor who promised to bring the bus back. Now an improved version of the double--decker bus will hit London's streets in 2012..\nAs for San Francisco, several trolleybuses remain in use but mainly as tourist attractions. They are too slow to be used for anything other than scenic trips.\nCity transport symbols may have a place in their city people's hearts, but it seems they are increasingly out of step with the modern world. As Londoners have proved, their continued life depends on people's willingness to fight for their survival.",
