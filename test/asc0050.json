  "article": "Deisha walked up and down as she waited backstage. This would be her most important piano performance yet. At ten years old, she was the youngest performer in the recital. She had practiced playing her song more than 30 times that week. When she closed her eyes at night the music played over and over again in her head. Now that the day had arrived. Deisha was not sure she was ready. She smoothed her hair and picked a piece of lint from the new dress that her mother had bought for her. She noticed that her hands were shaking. How could she play the notes of the song if her hands were shaking? She tried to concentrate on steadying them, but they play only shook more. Deisha's piano teacher, Ms Neal, walked up to speak to her. \" I have something for you. \" she said, putting a smooth black stone into Deisha's hand. \" It's a special stone. There's no other one like it in the world. You've practiced so much: you don't need anything else. \" The stage lights reflected off the rock. \" Thank you, \" Deisha said. When Deisha's name was called, she rubbed the stone, stepped onto the stage, and played better than ever. After her performance, she noticed that Ms Neal had a whole bag of black stones. \" Why did you say this one was so special? \" she asked. The teacher responded, \" Because, like your talent, it belongs only to you. \" ",
