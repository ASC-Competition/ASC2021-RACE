By delivering text direct to the reader's computer screen, the e-book could cut down costs, and allow creators to deal directly with their audience, by passing traditional publishers and traders. But it also raises the possibility of mass piracy. Phil Rance, founder and managing director of Online Originals, a London-based e-book publisher, sums it up, \" No one wants Napster to happen to books. \" Indeed, the most popular MP3may have put the frighteners on an industry that generally operates some way behind the \" bleeding edge \" . The Meta Group, a leading US-based market researcher, says publishers are far too concerned about protecting their rights, \" We believe all the recent legal control over Napster is like putting a finger in a river that is already overflowing. Publishers need to deal with reality and come up with new ways to develop wide electronic distribution, asking the question: How can we use the certainty of wide distribution to our advantage. \" At the moment, most publishers would like to limit the use of e-books to the person who bought them, or to the computer used to download them. If that can be done, e-books become just an extra income stream in a publishing industry that would continue to operate the way it does today, according to Terry Robinson, business manager for Adobe's e-paper group. \" If you've cracked the digital rights aspect, you've cracked the market. \" He says. Robert Nichols, Books Director at BOL agrees, \" Rights management is absolutely important. Publishers just say that ' until copyright is secure, we are not going to talk '. \" ",
