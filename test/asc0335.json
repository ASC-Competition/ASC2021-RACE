  "article": "Do you know how to talk to others politely in English? Have a look at the following.\nCould you give me five minutes? VS Go away.\nYou're really busy, but your classmate needs your help. When you're busy and can't help him or her, you can't say \"Go away\". And you can say, \"Could you give me five minutes?\"\nExcuse me. VS Move\nTelling someone to move out of the way is very rude . When someone is in your way, you should say \"Excuse me\".\nI'm afraid I can't. VS No\nIt can often be difficult to _ an invitation from a friend. Saying \"No\" would be impolite. It's a good idea to say,\"I'm afraid I can't.\" if you have to say no to an invitation.\nWould you mind...? VS Stop it!\nIf someone is doing something rude, would you like them to stop? You shouldn't say, \"Stop talking on your phone in the cinema!\" You can say, \"Would you mind not using your phone in the cinema, please?\"",
