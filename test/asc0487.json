As a seventh-grader, he taught himself coding by studying on the Internet. As a high school freshman, he passed the AP Computer Science A exam with a 5, the highest score possible. As a sophomore , he developed his own online course and helped his classmates get through it because his high school didn't teach coding. Everything he did came from his own interest. His father sent him a link to Codeacademy, an online coding training program, in middle school. He learned a programming language all by himself after signing up to the website. \" I just fell in love with computer science, \" Jawa said. Along the way, he lit a fire of curiosity and passion among classmates to learn coding too. \" All of my friends, especially the girls, were really, really afraid of computer science, \" he said. But the subject and exam weren't things to be feared, he said, \" Computer science is all about logic, not about how smart you are. \" To make his knowledge available online, Jawa set about creating his own online course, with easy-to-follow lessons. He included quizzes and tests too. The course has so far attracted 3, 200 students across the US and in 120 countries and regions, including China, Ukraine and Algeria. It shows, Jawa said, the huge need for coding lessons. When video lecturing, \" I deliver it like I'm talking from one high school student to another, \" Jawa said. \" It's always great to make it as clear and fun as possible, and to try to keep my voice as energetic as possible. \" He also does that, when teaching members of the computer science club he founded at his high school. \" His tutorials were great, \" said Taj Shaik, the club's co-president, who took the whole course last year. \" I'm definitely one of the early adopters of Moksh. \" \" He's pretty amazing, \" said Bob Moran, principal of Washington High School, who saw him lead the club. \" He was just a fantastic teacher\u2014clear, organized and entertaining. When a student got the right answer, he would throw him a candy. \" ",
