  "article": "For many Chinese, winter holiday season doesn't seem complete without the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. But it's impossible to satisfy all 1.3 billion Chinese.\nEven if you, especially young audience complain about the Spring Festival Gala, watching it while having Lunar New Year's Eve dinner has become a common way for families to get together. It's much more than just a TV program, it's also a way to bring family members together and get them talking during the holiday. Think about how you'll watch the gala and discover its fun.\n1. Share your opinions about the programs and artists with your family members. Introduce artists who young people enjoy to the elderly memebers of your family, such as \"fellow brother\" William Chan, or former singing group EXO members Kris Wu and Lu Han.\n2. Post your _ and complaints on micro blogs and WeChat moments to share with friends. Then they will know what you're satisfied with and what you complain about. In recent years, the gala is trying to attract young people by using Internet slang . Guessing when and what Internet chat lingo will be mentioned in the show is surely going to be hot on social media. Will there be \"drunk and tired\" ? Have a bet with friends.\n3. Online video websites such as IQiyi and Youku have introduced a real-time online discussion system. All comments are displayed on the screen. You can try watching the show in this interactive way instead of the traditional TV sets so that you may know others' opinions about the programs in the Spring Festival Gala.",
