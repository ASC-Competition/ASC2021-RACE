  "article": "Shoplifting   is happening in stores or supermarkets throughout the world. However, shoplifting happens more in British stores, according to a recent research, by the UK-based Center for Retail Research.\nNapoleon once considered prefix = st1 /Britainas \"a nation of shopkeepers\", to which so many people dreamed of traveling. Now it seems it is a nation of shoplifters. According to the research,Britainis the most light-fingered country in Europe, with nearly one in every two cases of shoplifting across the continent taking place in British stores. The report said there were nearly 566,000 reported cases of shoplifting inBritainout of a Europe-wide total of 1.27 million. The next worst countries in Europe,FranceandGermany, came well belowBritainwith only 188,000 and 167,000 cases, respectively.Switzerlandlived up to its clean-living reputation, with just 10,198 recorded cases of shop theft, and it is the lowest in Europe.\n\"The only reason I can think of is the higher level of criminality in Britain,\" report author Joshua Bamfield said. But the blame forBritain's poor showing does not lie wholly at the doorstep of Britons, Bamfield said, but also with some organized foreign groups traveling in cities such asLondon. \"There are traveling groups of thieves, many from places likePolandandRussia, that target large department stores,\" Bamfield said. \"The problem is right across Europe -- the criminals have formed their own European Union.\"\nBamfield said one factor causing some mistakes on the statistics was also likely to be that retailers in Britainwere more likely to record thefts compared to other nations, such asGreece. \"It's a social phenomenon that could happen in any countries\", said Bamfield, \"The most important thing is how to prevent it rather than accusing of it too much.\"",
