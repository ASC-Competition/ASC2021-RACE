  "article": "Security Services advise that there have been robberies reported in the East Oxford area, carried out by a group and involving threats of and showing of a knife.The victims have all been young males of student age and appearance who have been walking alone between 7 pm and the early hours of the morning.Some of the victims have been followed from the O2 and the Regal Hotel.\nThe Crime Prevention Advisor offers the following advice:\n*If possible walk home in a group, not on your own.If someone tries to take something from you by force, it may be best to give it to them, this way it will avoid you getting injured.\n              *If someone tries to follow you, make for a public place, such as a shop or a restaurant or walk towards other people.Make lots of noise and use your personal alarm to shock the person and use this opportunity to make your escape.If you need to use your mobile phone on route go into a shop or stand with your back to a shop window and constantly survey the area around you.Keep the conversation short and to the point and try not to be too obvious doing it.\n*Walk with confidence and look as though you're on a mission.Keep your head up and while you should look ahead to avoid unnecessary conflicts, such as a group of young men a-head of you, you should also be aware of everything around you.Whenever possible use well lit and busy streets and definitely avoid alleyways, wasteland and other quiet short cuts.\nIf you have any information relating to these crimes, please call Crime Stoppers on 0800 555 111 or call Thames Valley Police on 101 for non-emergency reporting.",
