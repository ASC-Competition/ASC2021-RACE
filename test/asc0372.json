Two thousand years ago, beside the beautiful Luobu Lake, there lay Loulan ancient city of the Silk Road. Businessmen from every country gathered there with lots of dancing parities. Everything shows that people in Loulan lived a rich life then. However, two thousand years later, this rich land suddenly disappeared from the map of China. It became an area covered with sand and dead tree trunks. Loulan was first \" discovered \" by a Swedish man named Sven Hedin in 1900, and people from America, Britain, Japan and Sweden all set foot here. Then in the 1930s, a Chinese named Huang Wenbi came to Loulan for the first time. He visited and studied this area and found many relics that were beautifully and carefully made. It is recorded that the ancient city of Loulan was the capital of the Loulan Kingdom during the Han and Jin Dynasties, and covered an area of some 10, 000 square kilometres. Inside the city, there are the ruins of government offices, temples and other old buildings. Outside the city there are some dried-up rivers and much farmland. In the past century many things have been dug up there including Han Dynasty coins, mirrors and many others of Greek and Roman times. All these things show that a lot of business between the East and the West once took place there. Lying on the northwest of the Lop Nur area, the Loulan Kingdom is now a lifeless area with endless \" forests \" of mounds which aren't easily seen in other parts of the world. Its mystery has been attracting many people from many countries.",
