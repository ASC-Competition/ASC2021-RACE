  "article": "Do you feel embarrassed when your mum tries to use slang  or when she calls you by your childhood nickname in front of your friends? And how about searching for the nearest exit when your father dances with joy when he finds his favorite CD in the shop? Loving them dearly doesn't prevent you from feeling uncomfortable around them. \nAnd parents have to accept that Adam Gopnick, a writer for the New Yorker magazine, said in an article published by the BBC: ''The one thing that is written into the human genome   is that exactly at the age of 13, your child... will discover that you are now the most embarrassing, ridiculous and annoying person on the planet.'' \nA survey by the site YoungPoll.com in 2010 suggested that one in three youngsters is so  _ by their parents that they refuse to be seen with them in public; and seven in ten children are humiliated   by their mum and dad's behavior, like kissing them in front of friends and holding their hands. \nPart of going through adolescence is a sudden feeling that we are wise and self-sufficient and we are embarrassed when treated like vulnerable babies. But we are bound to lose this discomfort when we reach our 20s. \nGopnick reminds us of writer William Blake's comment: ''When I was 14, my dad seemed to be so silly that I wouldn't even walk down the street with him. By the time I was 21, I was amazed how much he'd learnt.'' \nIn any case, dissatisfied parents might feel comforted in the thought that their grandchildren are likely to end up enjoying their company. Then the uncool   ones will be the grandchildren's parents!",
