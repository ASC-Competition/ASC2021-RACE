  "article": "Earthquakes are something that people fear. There are some places that have few or no earthquakes. Most places in the world, however, have them regularly  . Countries that have a lot of earthquakes are usually quite mountainous.\n         The most talked about earthquake in the United States was in San Francisco in 1906. Over 700 people died in it. The strongest one in North America was in 1964. It happened in Alaska.\n         Strong earthquakes are not always the ones that kill the most people. In 1755, one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded was felt in Portugal. Around 2,000 people died. In 1923, a very strong earthquake hit Tokyo, the Yokohama area of Japan. A hundred and forty thousand people died. Most of them died in fires which followed the earthquake.\n         One of the worst earthquakes ever was in China in 1976. It killed a large number of people. The worst earthquake ever recorded was also in China, in which 400,000 people were killed or injured. This earthquake happened in 1556.\n         Earthquakes worry people a lot. The reason is that we often do not know when they are coming. People can not prepare for it. Although we cannot stop earthquakes, there are things which can be done to protect ourselves during an earthquake.",
