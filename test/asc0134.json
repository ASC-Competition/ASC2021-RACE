  "article": "It was 11 pm. Donald Lubeck was lying in bed. Outside, lightning lit up the sky, and thunder shook the house. Suddenly he heard the smoke alarm sounding. Lubeck walked down to see what happened; he opened the door to the kitchen, and flames  just went out. The sudden strong wind from the doorway immediately created a large fire from a small one, probably caused by lightning. Lubeck went back to his bedroom to call 911. \"I felt safe because the room had a separate stairway,\" he explains. The phone didn't work, and when Lubeck tried to go down the stairway, he was stopped by a wall of flames. Lubeck realized he was in trouble. His daughter and granddaughters, who lived with him, were away for the night. \nUp a hill lived Lubeck's neighbors, Jeremie Wentworth and his wife. From his house, Wentworth saw the black smoke. He rushed out, and headed towards Lubeck's house. He knew Lubeck lived in the house. He dialed 911. On the phone, the 911 worker warned Wentworth not to enter the house. \"But I told the worker, \"Sorry, but I'm going in. I can hear Lubeck shouting \"Help me!\" I can't let myself do nothing in this situation,\" /he says. \"I went in and shouted, \"Donald, where are you?\" Then I had to run outside to catch my breath.\" After one more try inside the house, he gave up. Then the wind parted the smoke just enough for him to see Lubeck on the second-floor bedroom. But there was no way to get to him.\"I finally noticed a ladder,\" says Wentworth. He set it against the wall and pulled Lubeck down. Just seconds later the floor fell down. \nWithin the year, Lubeck and his family built a new two-story house at the place. Wentworth and Lubeck don't run into each other often, but Lubeck now knows that if he ever needs help, Wentworth will be there.",
