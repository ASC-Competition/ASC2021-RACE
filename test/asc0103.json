  "article": "One summer day as I was heading to the teaching building I heard someone call my name. I turned around and I saw Philip ,a counselor  at our admissions office , standing with another young man, Philip introduced me to him, Stephen, and reminded me that Stephen would be taking one of my classes.\nStephen looked at me. With a somewhat painful expression, he asked if my class was going to be hard and if he would be able to pass. I introduced all the things that he would be expected to learn. As we talked, I saw Stephen's eyes getting big with fear.\nI told him to do all of his assignments, and to hand them in on time. Rather than being overwhelmed  by all of the work, I told him the most successful students made a master calendar of all the assignments so they could plan their workload.\nAs the fall semester went on, I learned more of Stephen's story. It had taken him longer to finish the assignments than most young people. Family members , including his mother ,kept reminding him that he was a failure. But he kept at it and didn't take them to heart. He told me that before coming to our college, no one believed he could manage it.\nStephen didn't become an A student. Still, he managed to pass all of his courses by being in class every day, turning in all of his assignments on time and breaking down his study into bite-sized parts. By passing course after course he began to gain a measure of self-esteem.\nOn his graduation day, he walked up to me, and said \"Thank you.\"",
