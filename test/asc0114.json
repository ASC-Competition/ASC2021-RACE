  "article": "American schoolchildren often wear uniforms if they attend religious or other private schools. Most public schools do not require uniforms. But over the last ten years or so, more of them have moved in that direction, including high schools. Students may have to wear a specially purchased uniform. Or they may just have to dress alike~for example, white shirts and dark color1ed pants or skirts.\nEven schools that do not require uniforms generally have a dress code or other rules about what they consider acceptable. Policies commonly ban clothing that shows offensive  images or words, or simply too much skin. Items like hats may be not permitted because ,for example, different color1s may be connected with violent gangs.\nSome parents like the idea of uniforms. They say it means they do not have to spend as much on clothing for their kids. Others, though, argue that uniforms represent an unnecessary cost There are also debates about whether uniforms or other dress policies break civil rights.\nStudents and parents have taken legal action against school dress requirements. Just last week, a judge blocked a middle school in Napa, California, from enforcing a dress code unless families have a way out of it The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California brought the case for the families of several students who werfe punished Most attention centered on a girl who wore socks with the Tigger character from Winnie the PooK\nThe school said its clothing policy, including no pictures of any kind, was needed to control a growing problem with gangs. The families argued that the policy went against free speech rights as guaranteed by the United States and California constitutions. The United States Supreme Court says student expression is protected as long as it does not harm the work and discipline of a school.",
