  "article": "Dear Boris,\nThanks for your nice letter.\nAfter I had spent a week with my English family, I slowly began to understand their English a little better. It's very different from what I learned at school! Students in my group are from different cities of Britain and their dialects   are different too! Some of their accents   are quite strong and they also have their own words and expressions.\nBut it's not the language that's different and surprising. Before I came to England I had thought that fish and chips were eaten every day. That's quite wrong! I get rather mad now when I hear all the foolish words about typical   English food.\nI had expected to see \"London fog\". Do you remember our texts about it? We had no idea that most of this 'thick fog' disappeared many years ago when people stopped using coal in their homes. But the idea to speak about the weather was very helpful. The weather in London is really changeable.\nOn the other hand habits are different. People tell me what is typically British here in London is not always typical in Wales or Scotland. Local habits and traditions are not the same as what we knew.\nBut what is ordinary for all British is that they follow traditions. Probably Britain has more living signs of its past than many other countries. And people have always been proud of having ancient buildings in capitals, big cities and the countryside.\nI will tell you more about Britain in my other letters.\nLove from Britain,\nPeter",
