  "article": "Tiger Mom,\nYou've been criticized  a lot since your book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, came out. One problem is that some people don't get your humor. They think you're serious about all things and Lulu and I are suffering a lot from such a strict mother. That is not true.\nBut for real, it's not their fault. No outsider can know what our family is really like. They don't hear us laughing over each other's jokes. They don't see us eating our hamburgers with fried rice. They don't know how much fun we have when the six of us dogs included squeeze into one bed and argue about what movies to download from Netflix.\nI admit it: Having you as a mother was no tea party. There were some play dates I wish I'd gone to and some piano camps I wish I'd got away from. But now that I'm 18 and about to leave the tiger den , I'm glad you and Daddy raised me the way you did.\nA lot of people have accused you of producing robot kids who can't think for themselves. Well, I came to the opposite conclusion: your strict parenting made me more independent .\nEverybody's talking about the birthday cards we once made for you, which you refused to take because they weren't good enough. Funny how some people believe that Lulu and I will feel hurt for life. But let's face it: It took me 30 second; I didn't put my heart into it. That's why, when you rejected it, I didn't feel hurt at all.\nThere's one more thing: I have come to understand what it really means to live a meaningful life to the fullest. To me, it's about knowing that you've tried your best, body and mind. You feel _ when the piano piece you've practiced for days and hours finally comes to life beneath your fingertips. You feel _ when you do something on your own that you never thought you could. And for that, Tiger Mom, thank you.\nYours,\nSophia",
