  "article": "Lin Tao and Chen Hai are good friends. They are in the same class. They are in the same team. Lin Tao sits behind Chen Hai. Now it is four o'clock. School is over. They often go to play games after school. They can't look after their things very well. So their mothers don't give them watches. They don't have watches. They don't know the time. But they can ask a man under the big tree. His watch is very nice. They can also see the clock on the wall of the classroom. Now it's about five in the afternoon. It's time to go home. They must put on their clothes and go home.",
