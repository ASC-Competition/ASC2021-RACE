  "article": "We've all heard the phrase \"love is patient\", but one couple in prefix = st1 /Michigan, took this phrase to a whole new level. On Monday, February 13, Willard Mason sat down to talk about his relationship with the love he lost more than 60 years ago. Good fortune and fate recently helped the couple reunite.\nIn 1941, Willard Mason and Llah Ost, both senior 2 students, became engaged to be married and began planning their lives together. But Willard moved away to work at Willow Run Bomber Plant, where he met and fell in love with a woman named Helvi. He broke off his long distance engagement to Llah and married Helvi in 1942. Llah later found love with someone else. Both had happy marriages and raised families. \nThen, in 2003, Helvi died. A year later, Willard found himself back in his hometown, where by chance, he ran into Llah's brother. He informed Willard of the death of Llah's husband, and encouraged him to call her. \nAfter that first phone call, the couple began dating. Willard made the drive from his home near Houghton Lake to Llah's home in Adrian. On one such trip, he blacked out, and his car hit a tree. He was rushed to a hospital, where tests showed that he needed a new pacemaker . Willard moved closer to Adrianand asked Llah to move in with him. She gladly accepted.\n\"We get along perfectly,\" Willard told AZ Central on Monday. \"We've never had an argument, she's a great cook, and she takes care of me.\" \nAlthough both Willard and Llah are saddened by the 62 years they spent without each other, neither seem to have any regrets. Willard told AZ Central, \"You don't know how our lives might have turned out if we'd gotten married in 1941, but now she has a wonderful family, and so do I.\"",
