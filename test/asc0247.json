According to a recent International Data Corporation Study, over half of all Americans have a smartphone and reach for it as soon as they wake up, keeping it in hand all day. In addition, too many people in society are using smartphones while driving and as a result, they get into danger. 34 percent of teenagers admit sending messages while driving. People\u2019s addiction to their smartphones is unbelievably becoming more important than the lives of themselves and others. Just as drivers ignore the importance of focusing while on the road, many people also fail to recognize the importance of human communication. When with their friends, some people aimlessly check or send messages in front of a friend, which sends a message to that friend: the person I am texting is more important than you. In addition, depending on our smartphones to make friends does not give us the same advantage as being able to make new friendships in the real world. Face-to-face conversations will give us much stronger communication skills in the long run. As many people risk their lives and the lives of people around them just to send a message or mindlessly check their messages, smartphones are in many ways more dangerous to people. The quality of this technology is preventing societal achievements and weakening the value of communication. Not only is the smartphone affecting our desire to communicate face to face, but it is also lowering society\u2019s ability to communicate.",
