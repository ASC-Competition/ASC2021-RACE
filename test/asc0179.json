  "article": "When I opened my e-mail the other day, a pretty woman named Rachel appeared on my computer screen. She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm . Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss. She was reading to me an e-mail from my brother, and a lot of it was about the trouble he had getting the phone company to give him a high-speed Internet connection. It was pretty cool.\nRachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail. An ace man lets you send an e-mail that gets ready to the recipient by an attractive male or female from or by a clown . The software, which is free, can be downloaded at www.facemail.com.\nFacemail faces are lifelike, and they simulate emotions based on emotions-for example, that you put in your text. Type in; -x, and Rachel blows a kiss.\nLife Fx, the company that develops the Facemail, is sure there are broad business uses. The reason e-business is not popular, the company says, is that buying over the Internet lacks the human touch. But what if you went to the Nike website and Michel Jordan greeted you by name, waited on you and personally closed the sale? And it is talking with Whirlpool about using the technology in a computer screen on a fridge. Then if Mom can't be home when the kids get back from school, she can leave a note with voice and image telling them what there is to eat. Facemail could get hot fast. Personally, I'm a fan. But Facemail should be used with care. The clown looks lively and funny at first. But if you select the clown, put a few rude words in an e-mail and add some angry emotions, you're got Psycho-mail .",
