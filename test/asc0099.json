  "article": "Does your local town have a nickname  ? If so, what does it say about the area and the people who live there?\nMany cities are recognized across the world by their unofficial names. New York is the Big Apple, London is the Big Smoke, and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land.\nA project has been carried out to make a survey on how the nicknames of some places came about. The University of Winchester's Professor Bill Lucas is a patron   of the English Project. He explains that unofficial place names often show what people think about a place.\n\"The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings,\" he says.\nBasingstoke is a town in central England. The local nickname, Amazingstoke, shows the love that locals seem to have for the area.\nSwindon, on the other hand, is sometimes called Swindump, showing that some people think it's a dump  . Stanford Le Hope in Essex is called Stanford No Hope by locals. And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it's become known as Padstein.\nSome people say that the project may have a practical use. Glen Hart, the survey's head of research, says the information could be very helpful to the emergency services, for example. \"By having the most complete set of nicknames we could help the emergency services quickly  _ the right place as soon as possible, for people usually remember the nicknames of some places instead of their official names. And this will take the helpers less time to reach the places.\" he says.",
