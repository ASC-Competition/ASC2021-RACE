  "article": "\"A good parent\" can be a confusing phrase. It is almost impossible for one person to be \"a good parent\" at all stages of a child's life. Some parents are at their best before their children begin to speak. Others are most successful before their children enter elementary school. Still others make their finest contribution to older children or teenagers. Every parent can understand one stage of a child's development better than another. It is hard for a person to possess superior capacities throughout the entire period of a child's growth.\nA mother might be \"a good parent\" from her baby's birth until it is three; that is the period when it needs her protection and loving care. Then the start of her child's independence might upset and alarm her, and she might then become less helpful for a few years. A father might be awkward and uncomfortable with a younger child, but could turn into an excellent parent when the child is old enough to be taught the skills of cycling, fishing and so on, or to be taken on trips. Some parents feel easier with boys, and others with girls -- and then only at certain ages or stages.\nIt is important for parents to understand and accept their own limitations in these matters, just as they must accept the child's faults of personality and limitations of talent. Otherwise, fathers and mothers will feel guilty and blame themselves for weaknesses that may not be their faults. Much of the guilt experienced by modern parents comes from the mistaken feeling that they ought to be all things at all times to the child, which is clearly mistaken. In past ages, grandparents and uncles and aunts lived with the family, and provided different kinds of support; in our present \"nuclear\" family, too many roles are demanded of the two parents, which they cannot possibly fulfill.",
