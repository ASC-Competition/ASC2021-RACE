  "article": "The US teenager Thomas Cheatham had planned to study Latin during his time at Hebron High School in Texas. But when he learned that the school district was going to offer a Mandarin class, he quickly changed his mind. \" I thought Mandarin would be more beneficial than Latin, \" said Cheatham, who is now in his second year of studying the language. He speaks Mandarin to order food at Chinese restaurants and can read social media posts from his Chinese-speaking friends. While it's a difficult language to master, the high school junior, who plans to study computer engineering, thinks it will be important for his career. \" Chinese is a good language to know, especially with China becoming a growing power, \" he said. Many experts agree that proficiency in a language spoken by a billion people worldwide will give American students an edge in the global economy. \" People are looking at China as our next economic competitor, and interest in Mandarin is growing, \" said Marty Abbott, executive director of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. \" We're seeing it in all parts of the country. \" Abbott estimates that as many as 100, 000 students are now studying Mandarin throughout the US, in public and private schools. She said the US government has designated Mandarin as a \" critical needs \" language and provides professional development programs for teachers. \" Our government wants to increase our language competency for national security and economic competitiveness, \" Abbott said. At the same time, the Chinese government is spreading knowledge of the Chinese language and culture through Confucius Institutes established in many US states. For example, the Confucius Institute at the University of Texas in Dallas has been the home of a Confucius Institute for 10 years. It sponsors Confucius Classrooms at 21 local public and private schools, where tens of thousands of students are learning Mandarin.",
