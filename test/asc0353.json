Some have more names. In the USA, most people have a first name, a middle name and a last name. Parents choose the first name and middle name for their babies. There are names for boys and names for girls. For example, John, Peter, Tom and Mike are all names for boys. Elizabeth, Bonnie, Susan and Mary are all girls' names. The last name is the family name. All people, places and things have names. Names are important.",
