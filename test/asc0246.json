  "article": "Everyone has probably seen a movie or two about robots going against man. As a kid it was interesting, but not a reality. But today, when we look at how far scientists have come, it\u2019s not just a funny thought but a real possibility. Honda has already created a robot with eyes, legs, arms and hands and it can act just like a person. There is no end to what a robot could do in the future. Just think what we can do in twenty to thirty years. We\u2019re dealing with almost an entire new species of human-like robots that could be cleverer than us. Can we continue to use these robots in a way that they serve us, or will they become so wise that they will want independence ? I am really not sure just how far scientists are going to perfect robots. But once this type of robot is made, they will be able to think, make decisions, sense the movement of others and decide what it wants to do. A new invention has led to the introduction of a female robot, which was introduced at an entertainment show in Vegas. The robot called Roxy sells for between seven and ten thousand dollars. It is built to accompany females. This female robot companion is called true companion and you can find such robots on the Internet. Robots used to have limited uses, but now they are almost in every field. This has opened the door to many dangerous possibilities in the future.",
