  "article": "Health insurance   can be very expensive. Some working people do not make enough money to pay for it. In the US there is a program called Healthy Families. This program offers people health insurance at a low cost.\nFamilies are charged about $7.00 a month for every child, and $10.00 for every adult. It costs much less than any other kind of health insurance. Having health insurance is very important. With this insurance, people can see a doctor when they are sick or hurt. \nThe program is not expensive at all, but many people are still not enrolling   in it. People say that it still costs too much money. They need all of their money to pay for things like food and rent  .\nIt would be great if everyone could have health insurance. People are working hard to come up with ways to make this happen. One idea is to make the Healthy Families Program free for some people.\nIt is important for people to see a doctor when they need to. The Healthy Families Program makes it possible for more people to do this. Many ideas are being considered. Hopefully some of them will allow even more families to get health insurance.\nThe Healthy Families Program is made to help those who don't have welfare   and cannot earn enough to pay for private health insurance. It is an important program, but officials say that too many people are signing up for it and then dropping out   because of the Healthy Families Program's cost.",
