  "article": "\"Can I see my baby?\" asked the happy new mother. When the baby was in her arms, she couldn't believe her eyes. The baby was born without ears.\nTime proved  that the baby's hearing was very good though he had no ears. He got on well with his classmates. But one day, he said to his mother, tears in his eyes, \"A big boy called me a freak  .\"\nThe boy's father asked the family doctor. \"Could nothing be done?\"\n\"I believe I could graft   on a pair of outer ears if they could be got,\" the doctor said. They tried to find a person who was helpful for the young man.\nOne day, his father said to the son, \"You're going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But we must keep it a secret who the person is.\"\nThe operation  was a great success, and a new person appeared. His cleverness and hard work made him a very successful person. He married and lived a happy life.\nHe once asked his father, \"Who gave me the ears? I could do enough for him or her.\"\n\"I do not believe you could, \"said the father.\" The agreement was that you are not to know...not yet.\"\nFor years they kept it a secret, but the day did come. He stood with his father over his mother's body. Slowly, the father raised the thick, brown hair. To his surprise, the son found his mother had no outer ears.\n\"Mother said she was glad she never needed to cut her hair,\" his father said in a low voice, \"and nobody ever thought mother less beautiful, did they?\"",
