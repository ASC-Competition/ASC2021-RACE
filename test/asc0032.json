About sixteen percent of the city's population are black. News of this election appeared on the front pages of newspapers everywhere in the United States. Here is how one major newspaper reported the event. LOS ANGELES ELECTS BRADLEY MAYOR UNSEATING YORTY BLACK WINS 56% OF VOTES Bradley called his victory over Yorty \" the fulfillment of a dream \". During his childhood and youth, people had kept telling him, \" You can't do this, you can't go there, because you are a Negro. \" Nevertheless he had won a decisive victory over a man who had been won 43.7 percent. Los Angeles voters have had many opportunities to judge. Thomas Bradley had to form an opinion of him. The son of a poor farmer Texas, he joined the Los Angeles police force in 1940. During his twenty-one years on the police force he earned a law degree by attending school at night. He was elected to the city council years ago. At the time of the Los Angeles election, three other American cities already had black mayors, but none of these cities had as large a population as Los Angeles. Besides, the percentage of blacks in those other cities was much larger. Cleveland, Ohio, had thirty-six percent black when Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1967. In the same year Richard Hatcher was elected mayor of Cary. In Newark, New Jersey, sixty percent of the population were black when Kenneth Gibson was elected in 1970. Thus election of a black mayor in those cities was not very surprising. In Los Angeles, thousands of white citizens voted for Thomas Bradley because they believed he would be a better mayor than the white candidate. Bradley had spent forty-eight of his fifty-five years in Los Angeles. Four years ago, Bradley lost mayoral election to Yorty. This time Bradley won.",
