  "article": "Most people follow others blindly mainly under the effect of peer  pressure. Some people also feel it safe to follow a large number of people. In some _ cases it might be right to follow the crowd  , but in most cases this can be one big mistake. Ninety-five percent of people never succeed because they are following the wrong group. Actually there are reasons why we shouldn't follow the crowd blindly.  According to a study, people tend to follow the crowd when they aren't sure about the direction they should take. This means a large number of people could be following others without understanding what's right and what's wrong! This attracts more people to follow them and the result is that most people move in a certain direction even if it isn't right.\nA man who wants to be successful always hopes for others' guidance and he usually follows the same path of most people, but the question this man never asks himself is: are all of those people successful? Of course not! If you want to follow a crowd, then follow a successful one. However, in real life you'll only find one successful person among hundreds of people, and that's why following the crowd makes no sense at all.\nMost people act without thinking wisely. If you always follow others because\nthey're greater than you in number, then sooner or later you'll discover that you're\nmaking decisions you might regret later.\nHowever, should we never follow the crowd?No. I'm not trying to say you should never follow the crowd, but instead I'm just asking you to think wisely before you take a decision. If you find others are right, there is no problem in following them, but if you have doubts about the direction they're moving in, don't follow them blindly.",
