  "article": "Yang Nan, 17, was happy to move to her new home in a northern area of Beijing. She was told that her neighborhood used to be farmland planted with vegetables, corn and wheat. But looking at the new road, beautiful park and supermarkets, Yang couldn't see any sign that food was once grown there.\nYang is not alone. In recent years, many Chinese people have moved into new houses in country areas. Tall buildings have been built everywhere in the suburbs. The crops and fruit trees are no more. But these changes have caused problems too, warns Gan Zang chun, an official at the Ministry of Land and Resources  .\n\"Chinese cities are growing fast. This has made the area for farmland much smaller. This is really bad for the country's ability to grow food, not to mention the lives of farmers,\" said Gan last Monday.\nThe country needs farmland to grow food for the people of China. But the recent rise in house prices has made selling land a good business. A lot of land has been used to build new houses for sale.\nPollution, which makes land useless, is another reason for the big drop in China's farmland. About 2.67 million square kilometers of land in China have been polluted and turned into desert.\nThe government wants China to have at least 120 million hectares  of farmland. But there are only about 121.8 million hectares left. \"It will be really difficult to reach the goal,\" Gan said. He said that the government would fight illegal land use and stop farmland from becoming desert.",
