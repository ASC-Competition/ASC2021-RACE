  "article": "The scientists from the Lockheed Space Company   work in Felton, California, with the help of a computer. But the computer is placed in Sunnyside, about 80 kilometers away. What the scientists input is sent by telephone lines to the computer, and after a time, copies of the designs are needed back in Felton as possible. Lockheed people have tried several ways of sending the prints  , but the most effective seems to be by pigeon  . Are pigeons really used to carry messages in these days? They are, and they send the prints faster and cheaper than any other way.\nHuman   messengers (persons carrying messages) are much more expensive and slower than the pigeons. The road to Felton goes through the mountains, and the driving is not easy. An electronic printout system  could do the work in Felton, but at a cost of 10 dollars a print. Pigeons carry the designs for about 1 dollar each.\nNow Lockheed people have ten pigeon messengers. The pigeons do the work, and they have made Lockheed more famous. You can often read the news about the pigeons in the newspapers around the world.",
