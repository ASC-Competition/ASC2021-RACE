  "article": "If you could see a movie of your life before you lived it, would you want to live it? Probably not. The excitement of living is that you don't know what's coming.\nSure, it's hard to see uncertainty in such active light when you're out of work, or when you feel like you're failing. But uncertainty is really another word for chance.\nWhen Allison graduated from Harvard, she had chances all over the place but had no idea what she wanted to do. She took a job in consulting ,but she knew she wouldn't stay there. She took the GRE and scored so high that she was able to increase her income by teaching students. Still, she didn't think she wanted to go to graduate school . Allison knew she wasn't doing what she wanted, but she didn't know what she wanted.\nShe worried. All her friends were going to graduate school or starting their own businesses. She was lost and felt that she would never find anything out. After six years, Allison, by having a plan in mind, got married, moved to the Midwest, and used her consulting experience to get a great job. Allison realized that she spent her years finding her way: time well spent, and time we must all take if  we're being honest with ourselves. The only way to lead an interesting life is to face uncertainty and make a choice. Otherwise your life is not your own - it is a path someone else has chosen. Moments of uncertainty are when you create your life, and when you become who you are. Uncertainty usually begins with a job hunt, but it doesn't end there. Every new role we take on means another round of uncertainty. Instead of fearing it, you should find some ways to deal with uncertainty",
