There my mother buys some clothes for Kate. Then we go to Huaxing Bookstore. There I buy some CDs for Kate, and my father buys a book for her. In the afternoon my parents have a birthday party for Kate at home. Kate's friends Frank, David and Grace come to the party. Frank brings some pens for Kate. David gives Kate some balls because she likes playing with them. Grace gives Kate a cake . Kate is very happy. Oh, I am Kate's brother. My name is John.",
