  "article": "Kinsale may be one of the smallest towns in Southern Ireland, and it's also one of the most famous towns. It is well known for its wonderful fish restaurants. Some of the best known chiefs in the world have practiced in the restaurants there. The town itself is very beautiful in Southern Ireland by the sea. Here it is cooler in summer than other island towns. A big building overlooks the town and it is one of the most beautiful in the whole country. To the north of the town there is a high mountain standing in the country. The town is very beautiful, with its many craft shops and narrow cobbled streets. Most travelers visit Kinsale for its fish restaurants, which are family owned. This means that the service is better than that in other restaurants. People are more welcoming there than those anywhere else. The food may be expensive but you'll have one of the most pleasant evenings in your life there. So go ahead and visit Kinsale.",
