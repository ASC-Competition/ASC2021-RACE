  "article": "As Danny put his lunch tray onto the cafeteria table, milk spilled all over his sandwich. \"This is the worst thing I've ever done!\" he said, \"It's not that bad,\" said his friend Elena, who was sitting across from him. \"Just get another sandwich.\"\n\"Sandwich? What sandwich? I am talking about the talent contest . It's only two weeks away and I don't know what I'm doing! Everybody will laugh at me. There's no way to avoid it!\"\n\"Don't be so _ , Danny,\" said Elena as she rolled her eyes. \"You're going to be great. You have the skills to do just about anything.\"\nDanny moved his lunch tray to the side and rested his head on the table.\n\"Sit up Danny,\" ordered Elena, \"I have an idea. Let's brainstorm a list of things you could do. We'll divide the list into categories or groups. Let's start with music. You play the piano, right?\"\n\"I stopped taking lessons in the third grade,\" said Danny.\n\"What about singing a song?\" suggested Elena.\nDanny shook his head no. \"Let's move on to another category.\"\n\"What about performing magic tricks?\" asked Elena, as she twisted thin strands of hair around her finger.\n\"I don't know how to play magic tricks!\" Danny almost shouted.\n\"Stop being so...\" Elena paused, \"That's it, DRAMATIC!\" Elena shouted excitedly. \"You could do a dramatic reading. You definitely have the talent for it. Mrs. Pace always calls on you to read aloud in class. You could read a play aloud. Maybe you could even get extra credit from Mrs. Pace. She rewards students with points for doing extra reading work.\"\nDanny thought for a minute. Then he smiled. \"Elena,\" Danny said, \"You are a great friend!\"\nElena smiled back. \"I just want to make sure you are a bright, shiny star when you step out on stage.\"",
