  "article": "Deng Nannan, 15, used to hate drinking milk for breakfast. But she had to drink it because her mom, as well as many others, said that milk was good for her growing body. Besides, milk and bread made up a convenient diet that saved her parents a lot of time after Deng entered junior school and had to arrive at school early in the morning. After that, Mengniu and Yili became her favorite brands of morning milk and yoghurt after dinner.\nHowever, she has been forced to change her diet since the recent milk crisis. Many best-selling milk brands such as Mengniu, Yili and Bright were discovered to contain melamine  , which is usually used to make plastic. The bad milk products have sickened more than 5,300 babies and killed four.\n\"I shifted to rice porridge,\" she said. \"My mom has to get up at 5:50 am to prepare my breakfast and make sure that it cools down when I get up.\"\nDeng has become addicted to milk, so she doesn't quite enjoy her morning meal these days although she knows that it's a tiring job for her working mom. \n\"I'll turn back to Mengniu and Yili when they finally improve their products,\" she said.  \nHowever, right now Deng's mom tries to adjust   her eating habits by cooking different foods. Besides rice porridge, noodles, egg soup and soybean milk are prepared as her breakfast.",
