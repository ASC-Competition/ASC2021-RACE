  "article": "Introductory Chemistry was taught at Duke University for many years by Professor Bonk.One year, two guys took the class and did pretty well on all the quizzes and midterms.They each had a solid A.These two friends were so confident in going into the final that the weekend before the final week, despite the Chemistry final being on Monday, they decided to go to the prefix = st1 /UniversityofVirginiato party with some friends.\n       They had a great time there.However, with their hangovers   and tiredness, they overslept all day Sunday and didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning.Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor Bonk after the final and explained to him how they missed the final.They told him they went up to the University of Virginia for the weekend and had planned to come back in time to study, but they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare.So they were late getting back to campus.\n       Bonk thought this over and agreed that they could take the final the following day. The two guys, happy and relieved, studied that night and went in the next day at the time that Bonk had told them.He placed them in separate rooms and handed each of them a test booklet.He told them to begin.\n      They looked at the first problem which was something simple about solution .It was worth 5 points.\"Cool,\" they thought, \"this is going to be an easy final\".\n       They then turned the page.They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on it.\n       The question contained only two words:(95 points) Which tire?",
