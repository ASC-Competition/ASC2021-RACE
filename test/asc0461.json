  "article": "If you won a lottery and had lots of money, what would you do? Most people start by buying themselves things, such as a new car or a bigger TV.\nMany people who win lots of money may suddenly find that they have a lot of socalled friends. The new friends they make may follow them for their money but they may also leave them when all the money is spent. Besides that, they can't decide what to do with the money, so they try to think what they want. In the end, most people usually decide to save the money.\nThere are some lottery winners who decide to quit their jobs, because they think they have enough money and don't need to work any longer. Some big lottery winners make even bigger changes--they end their marriages. They think that winning a lot of money has suddenly made them more intelligent and more attractive .So they feel that they have to be with a younger or more attractive man or woman.\nThey don't know their new money is just a bit of luck. _ can't change everything.\nNext time when you buy a lottery ticket, think about what you would like to do and what you wouldn't  like to do with the money if you won.",
