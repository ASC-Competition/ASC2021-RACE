  "article": "A farmer had four lambs ( ) . One was black , and the other three were white. The black lamb was friendly to the others in the group . But the white lamb s often laughed at him. They thought he was ugly. The farmer did not like him, either. He gave bad food to the black lamb.\nOne winter day, the four lambs went out to eat grass. They went far away from home. Suddenly, it began to snow. It was such a heavy snow that the ground was all white soon. They couldn't find the way home.\nWhen the farmer found that the lambs were not at home, he went out to look for them. There was snow everywhere. Suddenly, he saw something black . He went to it. Oh , it was his black lamb! And the white lambs were there, too. The farmer said excitedly, \"Thanks to the black lamb, I can find you! \"",
