  "article": "Even though she's quite young, Drew Barrymore can be a Hollywood legend  . She was born on February 22, 1975, in California. Being from a family that produced great actors, she quickly found her way into the spotlight  .\nWhen she was 11 months old, she made her first advertisement  on TV. She made her first movie at the age of 2. Five years later, she acted Gertie in Steven Spielberg's famous film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial(1982).[:,However, it wasn't all roses and sunshine when Barrymore was growing up. Most kid stars in Hollywood can't become stars as adults. And once they're out of order, their lives are in the darkness, smoking and drinking. So does Drew Barrymore\nAs she was growing older, Barrymore started to realize that life is more meaningful than dangerous actions in the films. She started to build a career in 1997. She has made a series of successful films since then, including Charlie's Angels (2000) and 50 First Dates (2004).\n\"In my life, there is darkness and drama , and I have yet to explore some of that in my work life. I just want to challenge   myself and prove that I can do more.\"\nActually, anyone who's not familiar with her disordered childhood might find it hard to believe she's such a sweet person now. Like many of the characters she plays in her comedy, Drew is easy-going and laughs a lot. In 2007, she was on the cover of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People issue.\n\"Life is very interesting ... in the end, some of your greatest pains, become your greatest strengths ,\" Drew said.",
