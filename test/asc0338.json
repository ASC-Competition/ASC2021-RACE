  "article": "There was a new maths teacher and some new students in the school. One of the new students named Karl was very _ . The other students tried to explain   numbers to him, but he didn't understand.\nBefore Karl arrived, maths was the most boring lesson of all. Now it was great fun. The children would listen to Karl and correct his mistakes. They all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then tried to think up the best ways to explain them.\nBut little Lewis was sure that Karl felt sad and wanted to talk with him. So, one day, he decided to walk after Karl after school. Lewis was sure he would see him crying. On the way home, Karl walked a few minutes to a park, and there he waited for someone to meet him...\nIt was the new teacher!\nThey went off, hand in hand. Lewis could hear them talking about maths. And that stupid Karl knew everything about it, and even much more than anyone else in the class!",
