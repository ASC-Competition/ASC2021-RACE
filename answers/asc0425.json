  "article": "Thursday, April 24th\nWe got to the clean, lovely city of Yangzhou early in the morning. This is our first trip to China. All the different smells attract our attention to the local food. We are going to try something special for dinner tonight. The hotel we are staying in is not expensive but very clean. We plan to stay here for a few days, visit some places in the city, and then travel to the Great Wall in the north.\nSunday, April 27th\nWe visited the famous Slender West Lake   which was crowded with visit ors from all over the world, and bought a lot of toys for our friends outside the gate of the park. Everything is so colourful, and we have taken hundreds of photos already! Later today we will do the famous foot massage   and then leave for the Great Wall. We will take the night train north, stay in Beijing for two days, and then catch a bus to the Great Wall.\nWednesday, April 30th\nOur trip to the Great Wall was long and boring. We visited a small village in the mountains. People in the village love the quiet life. They are the kindest people I had ever met. They always smile and say \"Hello\". Ralph and I can speak only a few words in Ch inese, so smiling is the best way to show our kindness.",
