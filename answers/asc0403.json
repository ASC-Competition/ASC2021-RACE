  "article": "Last month, it was my first time to have a bus tour for sightseeing in Hong Kong. It's really pleasant and interesting. Sitting on the second floor of the bus, I visited Hong Kong in a different way. When the bus passed along the street, all the buildings along the way seemed very close to me. I bought a one\u00adday pass priced around US $6 to enjoy unlimited rides on two important routes. I started the trip from Central Star Ferry, and took the H1 Heritage Route to travel around the Central and Western District. After leaving Star Ferry, the bus passed Western Market and Hollywood Road, where the famous antique shops are located, then Man Mo Temple. Not only could I see on the bus, I also got off at many stops. I got off in Man Mo Temple and walked along Lascar Row. Then, I got on the sightseeing bus to Dr Sun Yat\u00adsen Museum, which was built in 1914 to honor the father of the Republic of China. And the famous Hong Kong University left a good impression on me. After traveling back through the dried seafood shops without stopping, I went to the last stop at Star Ferry. After the heritage journey, I took the H2 Metropolis Route for my shopping tour. I left from Star Ferry and traveled through Wanchai to Causeway Bay and Times Square for shopping. Having bought a lot of things, I went back. Though tired, I did have lots of fun on my one\u00ad day bus tour!",
