  "article": "At an airport I overheard  a father and a daughter in their last moments together. They had announced her plane's departure. Standing near the door, he said to his daughter: \"I love you. I wish you enough.\"\n    \"Daddy, our life together has been more than enough. Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough too, Daddy.\" They kissed goodbye and she left.\n    He walked over toward the window where I was seated. I tried not to  _ his privacy, but he welcomed me in by asking:\n\"Did you ever say goodbye to someone knowing it would be forever?\"\n\"Yes, I have,\" I replied.\n\"Forgive me for asking, but why is this a forever goodbye?\" I asked.\n\"I am old and she lives much too far away. I have challenges ahead and the reality is that her next trip back will be for my funeral. \"\n\"When you were saying goodbye I heard you say, 'I wish you, enough'. May I ask what that means?\"\nHe began to smile. \" That's a wish that has been handed down from other generations. My parents used to say it to everyone.\" He paused for a moment looking up as if trying to remember it in detail, and he smiled even more. \"When we said 'I wish you enough', we wanted the other person to have a life filled with enough good things to sustain them,\" he continued and then turning toward me he shared the following as if he were reciting it from memory. \nI wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger. I wish you enough gain to satisfy your wanting. I wish you enough loss to appreciate all that you possess. I wish enough \"hellos\" to get you through the final \"goodbye\".",
