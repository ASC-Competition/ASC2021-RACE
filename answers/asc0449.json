  "article": "On May 1, a wildfire started in a forest near the Alberta town of Fort McMurray in Canada. Within two days, the fire grew larger and the people who lived in Fort McMurray had to leave their homes. While there have been very few people injured   by the large fire itself, it has been harmful to the community.\nCanadians in other places have been helping by sending money and _ to the Red Cross. Many people in Alberta have taken in people from Fort McMurray, letting them stay in their homes for free until the fire is put out. Many firefighters are needed to fight the fire and some of them have come from other parts of Canada to help. The brave firefighters were able to save 25,000 homes as well as the hospital and all of the town's schools, according to CBC news.\nThere have been thousands of other acts of kindness towards the people of Fort McMurray. Some musicians, such as Great Big Sea's Alan Doyle, are holding special concerts, with the money going to Fort McMurray people. And companies have been helping, as well. Beer-maker Labatt filled thousands of cans with water--instead of beer--and sent them to the people in Fort McMurray.\nThe fire is huge, spreading over more than 229,000 hectares  , but firefighters say they believe they are starting to get it under control--it is becoming smaller instead of spreading.",
