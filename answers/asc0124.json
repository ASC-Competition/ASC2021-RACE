They competed inShanghaifor the National Competition and were selected to go to World. The World Competition will be held at the University of Maryland in theUnited Statesat the end of May.\nOdyssey of the Mind is a creative problem-solving competition. Teams of up to seven students will solve a complex problem using innovative ideas and materials. They will be judged on originality in three separate categories.\nOdyssey of the Mind competitions emphasize team work and creative \"out of the box\" solutions.  The strength of this program is that the solutions are the work of the students only - neither coaches nor parents are allowed input. During the competition the students must work together as a team and think spontaneously and creatively.\nChengdu #7 is a key High School in the fields of science and mathematics. This is the first time they have had an opportunity to attend the Odyssey of the MindWorld Competition. For the seven team members and three coaches (teachers) it will be the first time to visit theUnited States. It will cost each student approximately 20,000 RMB for the twelve-day trip. They have been working hard for this opportunity for a year.\nTraditionally businesses have supported Odyssey of the Mindbecause it produces students who can work as a team and solve problems creatively. We are asking your company for a donation to help defer the expenses for these deserving students. Please make out checks toChengdu#7 and specify Odyssey of the Mind. Any amount you can contribute will be greatly appreciated and will help us to continue to prepare our students for tomorrow's world. \nSincerely yours,\nChengdu #7 High School \n#1 Linyin St. Chengdu, 610041",
