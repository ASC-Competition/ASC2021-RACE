  "article": "Several years ago, Kevin Stephan, then aged 11, was playing baseball when a player accidentally hit him with a bat.\nKevin fell down and his heart stopped. Penny Brown, the mother of another player, was watching the game.Penny usually worked in the evenings as a nurse, but luckily that evening she wasn't working. Penny ran to helped Kevin and saved his life.\nNearly seven years later, Kevin was washing up in the kitchen of the Hillview Restaurant in Buffalo, New York State. Normally, 18-year-old Kevin had school in the afternoon, but that week there were exams and he didn't have any class. At about 2 p.m., Penny Brown was having lunch with her family in the restaurant. She was eating when some food got stuck in her throat. She was very frightened because she couldn't breathe.\nKevin was a volunteer firefighter in his free time and he ran to help. A waitress tried to help her, but the food was still stuck in Penny's throat. Kevin pulled his hands quickly into her stomach and saved Penny's life. He didn't know it was Penny, but his mother, Lorraine Stephan, was also having lunch in the restaurant. She realized that Penny was the woman who saved Kevin's life, seven years before, at the baseball game. Both Penny and Kevin were completely amazed by the coincidence !",
