  "article": "Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706 and died in 1790.The philosopher and writer was one of the most important men in the early days of the United States. He believed strongly in the importance of hard work, and he himself worked hard all his life, from the time he left school at the age of ten.\n\"Poor Richard,\" a character Franklin created, summarized Franklin's ideas in short sayings . Many of Poor Richard's sayings are still remembered today. One of the most famous is \"Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,\" from the essay \"The Way of Wealth.\"\nIn the same essay , Franklin talks about the danger of laziness and the value of ambitiousness .He asks what is accomplished by \"wishing and hoping for better times\". He says that we can make these times better if we try hard enough. People who spend all their time just hoping will die without food. They shouldn't expect everything to be easy, or as Poor Richard says, \"there are no gains without pains.\" Franklin also says that we should work today, not wait until tomorrow. \"One today is worth two tomorrows,\" says Poor Richard.\" Never leave that till tomorrow, which you can do today.\"",
