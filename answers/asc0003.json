  "article": "If women are mercilessly exploited year after year, they have only themselves to blame.  Because they tremble at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion, they are always taken advantage of by the designers and the big stores. Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion. When you come to think of it, only a woman is capable of standing in front of a wardrobe packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear.\nChanging fashions are nothing more than the intentional creation of waste.

They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort, as long as they look right.

Do their unchanged styles of dress reflect basic qualities of stability and reliability? That is for you to decide.",
