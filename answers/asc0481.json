  "article": "I am Steve. I was born and grew up in South Wales. My favorite place to play was out on the hills where my imagination had plenty of space to expand  .\nMy family moved out of Wales when I was thirteen. I went to a new school. One of my subjects was French. Because I had never learned any French, my teacher told me to sit in the corner and write anything I was interested in. That's the time I started writing, just for myself, and I've been writing ever since.\nI have always loved BIG IDEAS, and so I enjoy writing fantastic stories. And I also write horror   I think they are like the old fairytales   ,and can teach you important things.\nI am in my forties on the outside, twelve on the inside. I like rock music, Indian and Chinese food, and I enjoy drinking. I live in a small village with my wife Mary, ducks, cats, goats, hens and lots of rabbits. If you'd like to find out more about me and hope to buy any books, go to",
