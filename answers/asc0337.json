  "article": "Would you like to adopt an animal? Although this sounds very unusual, some children have done just this. The Natural Zoo has given people the chance to adopt animals by paying for all of its food for one year. One of the animals that needed parents was a young tiger named Brocky. The people at the zoo said that it would cost about $900 a year for the food for Brocky.\nNot many boys and girls have $900 to spend. That is why several hundred children and grown-ups each have sent a little money to the zoo to help pay for Brocky's food. Some children sent in only a quarter because that was all the money they had. Other children sent in more money than that.\nSince so many people sent money to the zoo to help pay for Brocky's food, he now will be able to eat as much as he wants. Brocky surely must be a happy tiger to know that he has so many adopted parents. Many children must also be happy to know that they have helped to feed him. It really will be thrilling for those children to go to the Natural Zoo to visit their adopted tiger Brocky.",
