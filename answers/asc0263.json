  "article": "Language learning apps are very popular now and offer opportunities to learn vocabulary and practice grammar. But there has been a discussion about just how effective such apps can be. Among the most popular apps are Duolingo and Busuu. Previous research found positive results on the use of them. But these apps mainly concentrated on study with learners who had signed up for language courses and they only worked as after\u00adschool support, so the results were not always reliable. A recent study of 4,095 Busuu users has been carried out aimed to find out if users can actually learn a language with an app. Busuu provides learning materials for 12 different languages. It offers a special model where some content is available for free while some content is not. We find that its users are an even mix of men and women. More than half consider themselves to be at the beginner level as there is a decrease in users as their language levels go up. Most people use the app because of personal interest, or because they want to study or live abroad. Female users tend to use it less often but for longer periods of time than male users. Getting any feedback on Busuu depends on whether your answer is correct or not. While it is helpful, this is not the sort of feedback language teachers prefer, as it does not explain why the answer is right or wrong. In spite of this, feedback in the app is very highly rated. More than 92% of respondents state that the app has met their expectations and 86% rate the app very highly. In fact, more than 80% of the users surveyed strongly agree that using the app has helped them improve their knowledge of the language they are learning. Besides, language learning apps also create an environment where mistakes are only known to the users, and this can address the performance anxiety that many learners suffer from when asked to speak a foreign language. So language teachers should encourage their students to use them to do the grammar work, leaving precious class time for more language communication.",
