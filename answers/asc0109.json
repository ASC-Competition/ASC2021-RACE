  "article": "What teaches you more about China: learning the language or making friends with Chinese people? Doing both would be perfect of course and maybe some people would say you cannot separate the two.\n    I arrived in China in September 2010 and have been fortunate over the last year to teach English at a small university in Zhejiang province,about half an hour from Hangzhou.Despite starting with the best of aims to learn Chinese.in each term something seemed to prevent me.In the first term it was a bad cold and judging some public English speech contests,and then my father's death sent me home for a while.\n    But if I miss Chinese lessons this year I will make friends with several of the Chinese teachers at the university who also teach English.It's been a wonderful thing to be welcomed into their lives, to be taken and trusted as a friend.We have dinner together every Fright night,do shopping together, and drink coffee for hours in the cafes at the weekend and talk about anything and everything.\nIt has reminded me that while language is important to understand people and cultures,opening your heart and mind is far more important.I've concluded that in spite of my lack of progress in speaking Chinese, the best foreign Chinese speaker will never understand anything about China if they can't open their heart to the people they live and work with.I,of course,have been lucky that my Chinese friends speak close to perfect English.  \nWhat has surprised me is that many foreign teachers don't make the effort to make friends with their Chinese  _ .Some do,of course,and I am by no means unique.I don't speak much Chinese yet but this never stops me appreciating the best of China:its people.",
