  "article": "There's a man in the habit of hitting me on the head with an umbrella.At first I couldn't stand it;now I'm used to it.\n    I don't know his name.I know he's average in appearance,wears a gray suit.and has a common face one hot morning,when 1 was sitting off a tree-shaded bench in Palermo Park,reading the paper,suddenly I felt something touch my head.It was the very same man who now,as I'm writing.keeps striking me with an umbrella.\n    On that occasion I turned around filled with anger.He just kept on hitting me.I asked him if he was crazy.He didn't even seem to hear me.Thell I threatened to call a policeman.Calmly.cool as a cucumber,he stuck with his task.After a few moments of hesitation,and seeing that he was not about to change his attitude,I stood up and hit him on the nose.The man fell down.But he immediately got back on his feet,obviously with great effort,and without a word again began hitting me on the head with the umbrella.His nose was bleeding and,at that moment.Ifelt sorry for him I felt regret for having hit him so hard.After all,the man wash't exactly hitting me;he was merely tapping me lightly with his umbrella,not causing any pain at all.Of course.those taps were extremely bothersome.As we all know,when a fly lands on your forehead,you don't feel any pain;what you feel is annoyance well then,that umbrella was one huge fly that kept landing on my head time after time.\n    Convinced that I was dewing with a madman.I tried to escape.But the man followed me,wordlessly continuing to hit me.So I began to run(I should point out that not many people run as fast asI do).He took off after me.trying to land a blow.The man was out of breath so that I thought,if I continued to force him to run at that speed,he would drop dead fight then and there*",
