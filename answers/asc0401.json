  "article": "There are many useful suggestions that can help one to improve English. Here are some of them to increase one's English language vocabulary. Learning English vocabulary is about much more than just learning the right words. It is based on understanding important words and expressions. Learning a word will not help very much if you quickly forget it. Researches show that it takes from 10 to 20 repetitions to really make a word part of your vocabulary. Since most words are learned from how they are used in context , the more words one is shown, the better vocabulary one will have. Keep a piece of paper close to you. When you read, pay close attention to the word you do not know, write the word down and try to understand its meaning from the context. Then look up the word in a dictionary. Remember that if you do not use English words that you have just learned in conversation or writing, you will forget them very quickly. So the best way to learn new words effectively is just by trying to use them in conversation and writing. Remember also that practice is the key to fluent spoken English. Building vocabulary is a life-long task. Remember: \" In the beginning was the word. \" Your future could depend on how rich your vocabulary is. It will also determine the quality of your communication.",
