  "article": "My description of a hero is a person who  _ his all for others. A person who puts others before himself.A person who does ordinary things, not because they have to, but because they want to.\n         So I got to think who are my heroes? Several people came to mind. But there was one that really stuck out in my mind. I guess I really thought about it, but this man really is my hero. This man is my dad. \n         I know,we all think our dads are our heroes. But the truth is, I really can't ever remenber thinking of my dad really as a hero. I am sure that I have said that he was. But I an not sure if I ever really thought about in terms of what is a hero?I mean he never saved anyone's life. He never fought in a war. He never invented anything to make life easier for others. But as I thought of his qualities. I found myself saying yes, he is a hero.\n         My dad is like other dads. He worked hard to provide for his family. He made sure that the bills were paid . He made sure that there was money to buy food, and clothes for his family.But that is what Daddys are supposed to do. So that doesn't really make him a hero. It just means that he is a man who wants the best for his family, even if that means he has to go without.\nIn my eyes what makes my dad a hero is his faith. My dad is a man who has a very deep belief in his faith. He has put a good life before us his children.",
