  "article": "Driving a car at a high speed along a highway seems to be fun. You only need to follow the bright traffic signs beside the highway and it will take you where you wish to go. But to a London taxi driver, driving is not an easy job. A taxi driver needs to have not only good driving skills but also a good knowledge of the city of London, from the loneliest street to the popular restaurant around. He has to be at the service of all kinds of passengers   at all times.\nA London taxi driver said the following about his job.\nDuring the night it is usual for him to stop two or three times for some food. He said, \"I never drink when I'm working, otherwise I'd lose my license  .\"\nHe normally goes home between two and three o'clock in the morning. There are times he has to stay longer and try to make more runs. He said, \"That's the worst thing about working for yourself. If you don't make money, no one is going to give it to you. \"\nLondon taxi drivers not only \"take\" but also \"give\". Every summer hundreds of poor children from London go for a day at the sea -- by taxi! There rides are paid by the taxi drivers. At the sea, they are met by the mayor   , and a lunch party is also held for the taxi drivers and the children. After a happy day's running around the beaches and visiting the market there, the children go home again by taxi, free of charge of course!",
