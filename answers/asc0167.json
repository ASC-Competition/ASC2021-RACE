  "article": "Lindsay Morgan Lohan was born on July 2, 1986. She was such a natural beauty that she began modeling at the age of 3, and because of her natural talent, she played parts in over 60 TV commercials for companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Wendy's, the Gap, Pizza Hut, Calvin Klein, and Jell-O, in which she shared the screen with Bill Cosby. \nWhen she was 7, Lohan was required to dress up as garbage for a Halloween short play on the Late Show with David Letterman called \"Things You Find on the Bottom of the Subway.\" It was her first real acting job. In 1996, Lohan got her second big  _ when she was given a role on the long-running NBC soap opera \"Another World.\" For only one season, she became the third actress to act the part Alexandra Alli Fowler.\nShortly after, she hit the highway to fame when Disney sought to remake the hugely successful family comedy \"The Parent Trap\" (1998). In addition, she also got a three-picture deal with Disney thanks to this movie. Her next move was to appear in the Wonderful World of Disney production of \"Life-Size\" (2000), a comedy also featuring supermodel Tyra Banks. \nIn 2003, along with Jamie Lee Curtis, Lindsay Lohan performed in Freaky Friday and played one of the early roles that made Jodie Foster a household name. \nIn September 2002, Lohan also got a contract with music heavyweight Emilio Estefan Jr who is of great influence in music. She signed a five-album deal with Estefan Enterprises. In 2005, she released her first album, \"Speak,\" followed by \"A Little More Personal\" the next year.",
