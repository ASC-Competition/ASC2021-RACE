Widely recognized as the world\u2019s oldest competitive sport, wrestling appeared in a series of Egyptian wall paintings as early as 5, 000 years ago.

Organizers, s eeking direct links to ancient times, found wrestling was very popular across much of the ancient world, from Greece, Assyria and Babylon to India, China and Japan.

In Greco-Roman wrestling, the wrestlers used only their arms and upper bodies to attack. They could hold on ly those same parts of their opponents. It worked nicely from a historical attitude\uff0cbut another cheerful and relaxing style was sweeping across Great Britain and the United States by then. Known as \" catch as catch can \" , it had become popular at fairs and festivals in both countries. \u200bIn 1904, the Olympic Games added the second wrestling event and called it \" freestyle \" . Now, wrestlers could use their legs for pushing, lifting and tripping, and they could hold opponents above or below the waist.",
