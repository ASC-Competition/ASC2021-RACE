  "article": "Onceupon a time there was a wise man that used to go to the sea to do his writing. Hehad a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work.One day he waswalking along the shore. As he looked down at the beach, he saw a human figuremoving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the thought that someone woulddance on the beach. So he began to walk faster to catch up. As he got closer, hesaw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but instead he wasreaching down to the shore, picking up something and throwing itinto the ocean. As he got closer, he called out, \"Good morning! What are youdoing?''\nTheyoung man paused, looked up and replied, \"Throwingstarfishes in theocean.\"\n\"I guess I should have asked, why are you throwing starfishes in the ocean?\"\n\"The sun is up and the tide is going out.And if I don't throw them in, they'll die\".\n\"But, young man, don't you realize thatthere are miles and miles of beach and starfishes all along it. You can'tpossibly make a difference!\"\nTheyoung man listened politely. Then he bent down, picked another starfish andthrew it into the sea, and said, \"It made a difference for that one.\"Thereis _ in each and every one of us. We have all beengifted with the ability to make a difference. And if we can know that gift, wewill gain through the strength of our vision of the power toshape the future.\nWe musteach find our starfish. And if we throw our starfish wisely and well, the worldwill be better.",
