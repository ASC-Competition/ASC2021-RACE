  "article": "Nigel received a reward for his excellence in study. It began when he was selected to help the teachers in the computer laboratories.\nThe peak of his school career came not when he topped the school but when he was selected for the nationwide competition. Unlike everyone else, Nigel wanted to join the contest because he liked making something out of the Lego sets. Nigel spent the next two months rebuilding the robot. It was during the time that Nigel found out about the prizes for the competition as well as another competitor, Alicia, from a neighboring school. His early intentions were forgotten. Getting the thousand-dollar prize was more important than anything else. Nigel decided to befriend Alicia. Unaware of his intentions, she told him all about the robot that she had been building for the competition. He even helped her to put the finishing branches to her robot. He was glad with the way things had progressed. His robot was able to become a ball with its arms, which Alicia had failed to do.\nEverything didn't dawn on her until she saw him among the competition. She stared at him, puzzled at first, then angry and finally a look of helplessness came over her.\nThe flashbulbs of the camera exploded in Nigel's try. The robot bird performed actions so unique that the specialist judgments were the same. Nigel was so personal with himself that he did not even notice the girl standing a few feet away from him. Without her, he would never win the competition.",
