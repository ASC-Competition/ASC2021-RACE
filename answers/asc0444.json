  "article": "Victory Bacelis is a California immigrant who grew up in a poor village in Mexico. He is used to working hard. He works more than 90 hours a week at three different jobs, including McDonal's. He is saving up to buy a house.\nOne day, while Victory was cleaning the floor at McDonal's, he found an envelope and picked it up. There was $612 in it. He called the police to report the lost money. The police couldn't find the owner, so they gave the money back to Victory.\nThen Victory read a story in the newspaper about Adrian Snadoval, a baby who was very sick. Victory decided to give the money away to help pay for the baby's operation. Victory truly has a heart of gold.",
