  "article": "Germans have a word \" wanderlust \" which translated into English would be the desire to wander. Nowadays the opportunity to travel is endless. Thanks to low\u00adcost airfares, travelling all over the world is very accessible and sometimes it's even cheaper to fly out of the country than to travel within your own. I have always had the feeling of wanderlust. As a young girl it started from me wanting to explore my local woods at the back of my garden. With me growing up, I have a sense of adventure. And I found my local woods being replaced with the Brazilian wetland, Pantanal, where I went last summer in search of jaguars, snakes and crocodiles. The thing with travelling is always different. Even if you go to the same country, to the same town and stay in the exact same rest house, it would be a completely different experience. The people you meet will be different, and they will tell you their own travelling stories: stories of holiday romances, holiday horrors and stories that seem so suspect that you can hardly believe them until something ridiculous happens to you and you find yourself becoming one of those people telling your tales. Or maybe the difference is yourself. When you travel you are forced to be in harmony with a new culture. Whether it's eating a strange food, or staying with a family, where neither of you speak a common language and you have to communicate through hand movements and smiles, the experience gives me itchy feet to do it all again. And although wanderlust is originally a German word, the English idiom reflects a similar idea. Someone with that needs to leave or travel. This feeling to explore is found not only in language but in us. ",
