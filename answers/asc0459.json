  "article": "You are driving alone in your car on a wild, stormy night, when you pass by a bus stop, and you see three people waiting for the bus:\n1. An old lady who looks as if she is going to die.\n2. An old friend who once saved your life.\n3. The perfect partner you have been dreaming about.\nWhich one would you choose to offer a ride to, knowing that there could only be one _ in your car?\nThink before you read on...\nThis is a question that was once actually used when you are looking for a job.\nYou could pick up the old lady, because she is going to die, and you should save her first; Or you could take your old friend because he once saved your life and this would be the perfect chance to pay him back. However, you may never be able to find your perfect partner again.\nThe person who was chosen (out of 200 people) had no trouble coming up with his answer. He simply answered, \"I would give the car keys to my old friend and let him take the lady to the hospital. I would stay behind and wait for the bus with the partner of my dreams.\"\nSometimes, we get more if we are able to give up our thought limitation . Never forget to \"Think Outside of the Box.\"",
