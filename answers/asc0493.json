  "article": "The McDonald family from Glasgow, Scotland, were on holiday in Western Australia when their vehicle broke down in a desert area ninety miles north of the town of Laverton. This happened on a Tuesday, and the McDonalds were expected to arrive in the city of Kalgoorlie on Wednesday evening. When they did not show up, Mrs McDonald's brother told the local police. A spokesperson from the rescue team that discovered the McDonalds' vehicle said that the family planned carefully for their desert trip. They knew that they needed to stay with their vehicle instead of setting out to seek help, and they did the right thing by lighting a fire as a signal to attract attention. When it comes to making a desert trip, the spokesperson also suggested bringing warm clothing for the cold nights and light clothing, hats, and sunscreen for the hot days. Besides, travelers should have a well-stocked survival kit including a first-aid kit, map, matches or lighter, and a knife. They should also make sure to pack plenty of food and water, spare tires, and fuel. The spokesperson's final suggestion was to tell a friend or family member about your travel plans. After the unpleasant experience, John McDonald told reporters that he had read quite a lot about desert survival before coming to Australia. He knew that if they had tried to walk to the nearest town, they would not have been able to carry enough water and that they had to cut down on what they ate, because digestion requires a great deal of water. Mr McDonald said he was extremely happy to see the rescue team and thankful that his family had survived. When asked what advice he could share with other possible desert travelers, Mr McDonald said, \" Don't panic. Stay where you are and wait to be rescued. \" This trip through the Australian desert is one vacation the McDonald family will never forget!",
