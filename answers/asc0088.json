  "article": "The percentage of districts that require elementary schools to teach physical education increased, to 93% last year from 83% in 2000. \n    But just 4% of elementary schools, 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools provided physical education each school day, as is recommended by the disease control agency. One-fifth of schools did not require physical education at all.\n    In 2004, Congress passed a law requiring each school district to develop a \"wellness policy\" to promote the students' health by setting goals for nutrition education and physical activity. Those policies are just now taking effect, and some school administrators predict that the next survey will show more marked improvements. Some schools have set out to place health education on the same requirement with academics. In Los Angeles County, Sepulveda Middle School has banned soft drinks and eliminated unhealthy snacks from the school store. Salad, fruit and yogurt are always available in the cafeteria, said Patricia J. Pelletier, the principal. \n    Nearly an hour of physical education is required daily, the school offers after-hours training in distance running, and it has started a class on healthy cooking for parents. \n    \"If kids are healthy and have healthy lifestyles, they're going to be better students,\" Ms Pelletier said. \"They're going to be in school, and they're going to be connected with the teachers in a better way.\"\n    The survey found that nearly two-thirds of schools prohibited tobacco use at all places, including at off-campus functions, up from 46% in 2000. Another finding was that the proportion of states that require middle schools to teach human sexuality grew, to 59% from 46%. \n    The report found a variety of indications of healthier cooking in school cafeterias. 55% reported that they had removed the skin from poultry before cooking, up from 40%, and 46% now use low-fat cheeses, up from 31%. But 12% of elementary schools, 19% of middle schools and 24% of high schools offer students brand-name fast food from businesses like Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.",
