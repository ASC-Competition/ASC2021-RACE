  "article": "Mr. and Mrs. Green lived in a big city. One summer they went to the country for their holiday. They enjoyed it very much because it was a quiet, clean place.\nOne day they went for a walk early in the morning and met an old man. He lived on a farm, and he was sitting in the warm sun in front of his house. Mr. Green asked him, \"Do you like to live in this quiet place?\"\nThe old man said, \"Yes, I do.\"\nMr. Green then asked, \"What are the good things about it?\"\nThe old man answered, \"Well, the people here know each other. They often come and visit me, and I often go and visit them. And there are also many children here.\" Mr. Green said, \"That's interesting, and what are the bad things?\"\nThe old man thought for a moment and then said, \"Well, the same things, really.\"",
