  "article": "Friends play an important role in our lives, and although we can't be more familiar with the fact of friendship, we often don't clearly understand how we make friends, especially with Americans. Here are some pieces of advice on making friends with Americans:\n1. Visiting places Americans enjoy: parties, churches, restaurants, parks and sports clubs.\n2. Be willing to take the first step. Don't wait for them to get close to you. Americans in China may not know you speak English. They may be uncomfortable if they can't speak your language.\n3. Use small talks to open the conversation. Ask them where they're from, why they come to China, etc. . Remember: Be careful not to ask personal questions about age, salary and so on.\n4. Show an interest in their culture, their country or their job. Americans like to talk about themselves!\n5. Invite them to join you for dinner or just for coffee or tea. Try to set a specific time. Americans sometimes make general invitations like \"Let's go out for dinner sometime. \"Often this is just a way to be friendly. It is not always a real invitation.\n6. Don't expect too much at first. Maybe they're being friendly. But maybe they want to be your good friends. It will take time to tell.",
