  "article": "A gentleman put an advertisement in a newspaper to look for a boy to work in his office. From nearly fifty persons, he chose one and refused the others.\n\"I should like to know,\" said a friend, \"Why you liked that boy better. He did not have a letter or a recommendation  .\"\n\"You are wrong,\" said the gentleman. \"He had a great many. He cleaned his feet at the door and closed the door behind him. That showed that he was careful. He gave his seat at once to that old man. That showed that he was kind and _ . He took off his cap when he came in and answered my question at once. That showed that he was polite and gentlemanly.\"\n\"I threw some books on the floor and some persons went over them, but that boy picked them up and put them on the table. He waited quietly for his turn instead of pushing. When I talked to him, I found his clothes were tidy, his hair was brushed clearly and his finger nails   were clean. I think these are more important than a letter and a recommendation.\"",
