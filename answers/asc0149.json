  "article": "\"For those who haven't been to Tibet is a dream; for those who have already been there, Tibet is a memory.\" said Li Wan, a graduate from Zhongshan University. \"For me, living there is my dream and happiness.\"\nLi was suddenly crazy about Tibet after working there for three months as an office clerk. Since 2008, Li has spent most of her time travelling in Tibet. Four years have passed and she has been almost every corner of Tibet.\nLi came to Tibet firstly because of her desire for personal freedom. She entered Tibet along the Yunnan-Tibetan road, enjoying the special view happily. She was surprised to find that it is a white paradise  on earth. Although she couldn't even speak a word of Tibetan language, she had no difficulty in communicating with natives. \"To me, they are free, generous, simple and happy. It appears to me that people should live in this way, singing while working, dancing while living.\" Li said. \nLi Wan's dream is to live in Tibet for a long time. She has learnt to make good use of every penny and keep her cost of living within 300 yuan a month. Li has shown great courage in the adventures . On many situations she travelled alone in some places in terrible climate. To her greatest surprise, she learned to value life and to follow her own heart.\n\"I felt very close to death many times when I was in extreme coldness and quietness, running out of energy. After having survived the difficulties, I find more beauty in my life. I have learned to insist on my dream,\" she said.",
