  "article": "Joseph really felt very happy. When he arrived at his seat in the classroom that morning, he found an invitation on his desk. It was from several of his classmates asking him to join them on a camping trip. This was the first time he was asked to join in an out-of school activity. Why were they asking him now? Nobody seemed to like him. In fact, he had been so lonely _ . As a result, he had put on a lot of weight, and this gave the kids something more to make fun of him.\nCelina, who was standing near Joseph when he read the invitation, went out quickly to tell the others that the trick had worked. Everyone was pleased that Joseph thought that was true. But there was no camping trip. The whole thing was made up.\nAt first, Celina thought it was fun. But later, when Joseph told her that he was going to buy a sleeping bag with his savings, Celina had a second idea. She knew that Joseph's family had little money, and she hated to see him spend his savings on something he would never use. Celina also hated to tell Joseph the truth. Her close friends would be angry with her.\nWhat could she do now?",
