The tradition ended Saturday, when Rankin unloaded his last truck filled with fresh fruit and vegetables. \" People will probably keep coming, but it won't be the same, \" said Kate Shawcross, one of Rankin's first customers. \" He knows your children's names and where they go to school\u2014he's just the classic good neighbor, and here in Washington, we need some of that. \" Rankin was a farmers market pioneer, who got into farming by accident, said Bernadine Prince, executive director of FreshFarm Markets. Rankin is the co-owner of Twin Springs Fruit Farm and has witnessed the explosion of American interest in fresh produce and locally grown food. \" He's just one of those people who are interested in you as an individual and your tastes, \" said Bernadine Prince. \" Think about when you go to the supermarket: Who do you talk to? Nobody. \" In 1984, a \" farmers market \" consisted of some peaches, apples and cherries that the typical American might have considered as overpriced. But Rankin drew customers charmed by his huge smile and agricultural knowledge. He remembered to set aside things you asked for, would cash your check if you needed bills and gave your 10-year-old child his or her first job. The people who came to Saturday's market sang to Rankin, presented him with poems about his influence on their lives and told stories of good deeds he had done for them. Many described coming to Rankin's market as a routine in their lives. Rankin said he is retiring because he wants to spend more time traveling to see his children and a sister back in Ireland. The children of one of Rankin's partners are taking over Twin Springs. He has a \" fantasy, \" he said, of using his knowledge to help fruit-growers elsewhere in the world. He has faith that others can keep the Woodley Park market going, that the role of a farmers market is now established.",
