  "article": "Boys' schools are the perfect place to teach young men to express their emotions and involve them in activities such as art, dance and music.\nFar from the traditional image of a culture of aggressive masculinity ,the absence of girls gives boys the chance to develop without pressure to be consistent to a stereotype ,a US study says.\nBoys at single-sex schools were said to be more likely to get involved in cultural and artistic activities that helped develop their abilities to express their emotions,rather than feeling they had to obey to the\"boy code\"of hiding their emotions to be a\"real man\".\nThe findings of the study are against the received wisdom that boys do better when taught alongside girls.\nTony Little,headmaster of Eton,warned that boys were being ignored by the British education system because it had become too focused on girls.He criticized teachers for failing to recognize that boys are actually more emotional than girls.\nThe research argued that boys often perform badly in mixed schools because they become discouraged when their female peers do better earlier in speaking and reading skills.\nBut in single-sex schools teachers can adjust lessons to boys'learning style,letting them move around the classroom and getting them to compete in teams to prevent boredom,wrote the study's author, Abigail James of the University of Virginia.\nTeachers could encourage boys to enjoy reading and writing with \"boy-focused\" approaches such as themes and characters that appeal to them.Because boys generally have sharper vision,learn best through touch, and are physically more active,they need to be given\"hands-on\"lessons where they are allowed to walk around.\"Boys in mixed schools view classical music as feminine and prefer the modem type in which violence and sexism are major themes,\"James wrote.\nSingle-sex education also made it less likely that boys would feel they had to give in to a stereotype that men should be\"masterful and in charge\"in relationships.\"In mixed schools boys feel pressed to act like men before they understand themselves well enough to know what that means,\"the study reported.",
