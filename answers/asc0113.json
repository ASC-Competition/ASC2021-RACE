  "article": "Dear residents of Molten,\n    We can't keep silent in the current wild situation when prices for all existing products are skyrocketing unbelievably. The enormous figures on price tags for food products have caused a real panic. We've perfectly realized that, and that's why we have kept bread prices affordable for all this time. \n    At the moment all our reserves are exhausted. Stocks of bread-baking ingredients   such as flour, sugar, butter and the like are running out. To buy what we need at reasonable prices is virtually impossible today. \n    However, we all need bread every day, which means we will be forced to buy everything we need at much higher prices.\n    The cost of bread closely depends on ingredients. Another financial crisis  has led to a 300-percent increase of prices for butter, vegetable oil and others as of September 1. All these prices continue to grow every hour. \n    We have to take any possible measures which will help Figaro contain the growth of prices for its products. Despite of our SOS signal, no measures have been taken as yet. We have found ourselves in the same situation as any of you. We see the situation changing steadily for the worse. We will not cope with that alone.\n    Because of this, Figaro came to the critical point where it is necessary to raise prices of its products. We see one recourse (way): raise the bread price minimally and cancel our free plastic bag service. But what is next? This is the concern of all the 700 employees and the board of Figaro. \n    Every extra cent in the cost of bread upsets you and us very much. Making our sincere apologies for a forced increase of the bread price, we hope for your understanding and support. Today and tomorrow we are with you, as usual.\nThe staff and board of Figaro",
