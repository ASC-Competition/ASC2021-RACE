  "article": "Little Mike's grandma died  weeks ago. He missed her very much. One afternoon Mike went to the city park. There he saw an old lady. She looked very kind. She was sitting there, watching pigeons . Little Mike went up and sat next to her. He took out his food and drinks and gave some to her. She smiled  at him and seemed to  like him. Her smile was so sweet, just like Mike's grandma's. Mike was very happy.\nThey sat there all the afternoon, eating and talking. When it's getting dark, Mike had to go home. Before he left, he hugged the old lady and she gave him her sweetest smile.\nWhen Mike got home, he said to his mother, \"I met a granny in the park. Her smile was like grandma's.\"\nThe old lady also went back to her home happily. She told her son that she had food and drinks with a little boy. \"He was so lovely just like Brittany.\" she said. Her son was surprised, because he never saw her so happy after Brittany, her grandson, died weeks ago.",
