  "article": "Jack had gone to the university to study history, but he kept playing all the time and at the end of his first year, his history professor failed him in his exams. He was so poor at his subject that he would have to leave the university. However, his father made up his mind that he would go to see the professor to ask him to let Jack go on his studies the next year.\n\"He's a good boy,\" said the father, \"and if you let him pass this time, I'm sure he'll improve a lot next year and pass the exam at the end of it really well.\"\n\"No, no, that's quite impossible.\" said the professor at once, \"Do you know, last month I asked him when Napoleon  had died, and he didn't know!\"\n\"Please, sir, give him another chance.\" said Jack's father. \"You see, I'm afraid we don't take any newspapers in our house, so none of us even know that Napoleon was ill.\"",
