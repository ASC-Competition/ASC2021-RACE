He gets many nice birthday presents from his family and one of them is a big drum . \" Who gives him the drum? his father asks. \" His grandfather does, answers Jim's mother. Jim likes his drum very much. He makes a noise with it, but his mother doesn't say anything about it. His father is not at home. He is working in a school. So he doesn't hear the noise. But one of the neighbours doesn't like the noise at all. So one morning she takes a knife and goes into Jim's room. Jim is making a noise with the drum. She says to him, \" Hello, Jim. Do you know there is something nice in your drum? Here's a knife. Open the drum and let's find it.",
