  "article": "Homeschooling is the education of children at home, typically by parents but sometimes by tutors, rather than in public or private school. As a matter of fact, most childhood education occurred within the family or community.\nHomeschooling is a legal choice for parents in developed countries to provide their children with a learning environment at home. Parents see many reasons for homeschool, including better test results, improved instruction, to help the public system with fewer kids, poor public school environment, religious reasons, improved character development, the expense of private education, and objection to what is taught locally in public school.\nHomeschooling can also be a choice for families living in remote   locations, living abroad, and to allow for more traveling. Also many young athletes and actors are taught at home, where a coach   or tutor is with the child for many years and then knows the child very well.\nIn some places, an approved curriculum   is required if children are to be home-schooled. In some cases a liberal arts   education is provided.",
