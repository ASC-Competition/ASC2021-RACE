  "article": "Half a century ago,the picturesque Sicilian town of Poggioreale was hit by an earthquake thatcaused its citizens to flee for food, even though many buildings remainedstanding. What they left behind has become one of Italy's largest ghost towns. Andthe place was frozen at the exact time of the quake. Girolamo Cangelosi,the mayor of a new Poggioreale town that was built further down the valleyafter the quake, has an idea to bring it back to life and make it shine againas it did in the past He isn't just daydreaming. He has already begun drawingup plans and placed architects on standby. All he's lacking is money. Thus he recentlystarted a global journey, setting his sights first on former Poggiorealeresidents (\u5c45\u6c11) and their families, 5,000 of whom hesays are now living in the United States. Also scheduled was a stop inAustralia, where about 4,000 more are believed to have emigrated after the quake. Cangelosi isconvinced that he can not only persuade local families who have long left butstill feel a strong attachment to their hometown to sink some wealth into theirold home, but also turn to tourists and developers who can lend a hand. Poggioreale is alsothe latest town in Sicily and elsewhere in Italy to try radical approaches to keeping them from being forgotten. A series of otherlocations have sold off old houses for as little as one euro \u2014 or just over adollar \u2014 to people willing to move in. That's a deal that could be on the tablein Poggioreale, too. In theory, itshouldn't take much to restore Poggioreale to something like its former glory. Thetown has good facilities , though in badshape. There's a theater, library, hospital, marketplace and even a small innfor travelers.",
