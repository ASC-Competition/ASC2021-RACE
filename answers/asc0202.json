  "article": "Chinese President Hu Jintao, on his way to talks with President George W. Bush in prefix = st1 /Washington, on Tuesday met with Bill Gates.  \nAfter the meeting with Gates, the world's richest man, at Microsoft's headquarters, Hu restated that China would move against software pirates  all the time.\nAt Microsoft Corp.'s campus, Hu said on Tuesday he admired what Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates had achieved. He also sought to reassure Gates that China is serious about protecting intellectual property rights . \n\"Because you, Mr. Bill Gates, are a friend of China, I'm a friend of Microsoft,\" Hu said.\n\"Also, I am dealing with the operating system produced by Microsoft every day,\" he added, to laughter. \nGates responded: \"Thank you, it's a fantastic relationship,\" and then said: \"And if you ever need advice on how to use Windows, I'll be glad to help.\" \n\"Chinais focused on and has already accomplished much in creating and enforcing laws to protect intellectual property.\" he said. \"We take our promises very seriously.\"\nHu also said he would certainly welcome a further increase in Microsoft's investment in China.\n\"I'd also like to take this opportunity to assure you, Bill Gates, that we will certainly honor our words in protecting intellectual property rights,\" Hu said. \nIn his brief visit to the Microsoft campus, Hu, accompanied by Gates and company CEO Steve Ballmer, saw some business technology demonstrations and toured Microsoft's Home of the Future, which features experimental technology that might someday be used in people's living spaces. \nFollowing the visit at Microsoft, about 100 guests, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Gov. Gary Locke, the first Chinese-American governor, were invited to Gates' $100 million lakeside house on Lake Washington for a dinner. \nChina has recently begun requiring Chinese computer makers to load legal software on their machines. \nIn Seattle's Chinatown, many stores hung Chinese and U.S.flags to welcome Hu, and many in the crowd outside the stately Fairmont Hotel on Monday night where Hu was staying were there to support the Chinese president.",
