  "article": "The BBC was founded in 1922, including radio and television services. It is based at Broadcasting House in London. The BBC is controlled by some governors chosen by the government, but these people have freedom and the government can't interfere. That is, the BBC is supposed not to be the mouthpiece of the government. It has to be as fair as possible in giving radio and television time to, for example, political parties and religious groups. There is a kind of interesting service in British\u00adrental services. Many people prefer to rent their television sets instead of buying them. The rent for a black and white set is about 80 pence a week. The rent of a color set is more than twice that of a black and white set. If the sets go wrong, people can have them repaired free of charge or replaced immediately. Everyone has to buy a yearly license, since there is no advertising on BBC radio or television. It is from the sale of licenses that the BBC gets most of its money. A license for a black and white set costs 8 pounds, and for a color set 18 pounds a year. There are four special radio channels, which broadcast different kinds of programmes. Radio 1 is mainly pop music. Radio 2 deals with light music, sports and other programmes. Radio 3 broadcasts serious music, talks on serious subjects, etc. News broadcasts are mainly given by Radio 4. There are special programmes for Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and certain parts of England. It also broadcasts programmes about Britain \u2014 in many different languages as well as in English to all parts of the world.",
