  "article": "Joan, super visor   of the town's morals recently accused George, a local man, of having a drinking problem because she noticed his car outside the town's only bar.She reasoned, it was a logical assumption  .George stared at her for a moment and said nothing.Later that evening, he parked his car in front of her house and left it there all night.\nWhy is it that so many of our logical assumptions are just plain wrong? And why do we want to act as if they must be true? In an age long before the Internet, a young American at a party found himself seated next to the famous Chinese diplomat Wellington Koo.Completely not knowing what to say to someone from such a different culture, this young man turned and asked, \"Likee soupee?\" After all, he assumed, don't all Chinese speak in broken English? Mr.Koo smiled and nodded.Later when called upon to speak, Wellington Koo delivered a wonderful talk in fluent English, sat down while the applause was still continuing, turned to the young man and whispered, \"Likee speechee?\"\nDo you know why red roses are so popular? Men keep buying them.They assume that all women prefer red roses.But when women are asked what color1 of rose is their favorite, they are more likely to answer that they prefer yellow, white or peach.And when asked what kind of flowers they would prefer to receive, the answer is generally not roses at all.The age-old assumption that most women like red roses best is simply not true.\nWe all make assumptions.They're too often wrong and can easily get us into trouble.So here is what I've learned: when in doubt, check it out.And if I'm not in doubt, I still check it out.We may think we know.But what we know may not be so.So it's best to check it out.",
