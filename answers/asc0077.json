  "article": "Did the iPod kill music ?\nDID Steve Jobs kill the music industry? That's the question on many people's lips since rock star Jon Bon Jovi accused the apple boss of personally destroying the music industry.\nBon Jovi centers his criticism   on how he believes music downloading has robbed young people of what he calls the \"beauty of buying on album\", \"Kids today have missed the beauty of taking your allowance   money and making a decision based on the  _ , not knowing what the record sounded like,\" he said.\nBut far from killing the industry, many young people today think Jobs has been a blessing  , offering you instant, and selective access to a whole world of music.\nKeith Staskiewicz at Entertainment Weekly speaks for the feelings of many music lovers. He believes listening to Mp3s rather than records or CDs \"just saves them money\" and doesn't \"eliminate   the sense of discovery they get from new music\", Staskiewicz also argues that it's wrong to blame Jobs and Apple for destroying anything.\"Change is just part of the business,\" Staskiewicz said. \"No doubt in 50 years, Justin Bieber will complain in his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech about how kids don't listen to iPods any more.\"\nFor now, though, it appears that music downloading is set to continue for the near future. According to Summer Redstone, chairman of media company Viacom, iTunes has \"resurrected   the music industry by creating a legal, affordable purchasing system for fans\".\nBut recent surveys suggested that, despite the \"legalizing\" of music downloading via sites like iTunes, young people are still choosing to download music illegally.A report by Jupiter Research suggested that illegal downloading sites are used three times as much as legal ones. \nThe problem, according to its analyst Mark Mulligan, is how today's youth grow up viewing music as something they can get for free. \"Unless the music industry can shift these consumers   while they are young away from free consumption to paid music formats  ,they may never develop music purchasing behavior,\" warned Mulligan \" recording industry could suffer long-term harm.\"",
