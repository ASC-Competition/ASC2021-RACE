Tom Stancombe started exchanging letters with the queen after he set free a balloon, carrying his name and address, at a school party and it landed in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The queen spotted the balloon and asked her personal assistant, Angela Kelly, to write a letter on her behalf. She wrote, \" The queen was delighted to find that your balloon had traveled all the way to the gardens at Windsor Castle. \" Tom, who proudly put the letter on his wall, wrote back to say that his great, great grandfather, the artist Petrus Johannes Arundzen, had been commissioned to copy Dutch masters' on display at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace. Angela at once replied that she would contact the Royal Collection to find out what had happened to the art works.She kept her word and two weeks later wrote to Tom to tell him what had happened to the etchings, explaining they now form part of the print collection in the Print Library. Angela then asked a favor of Tom, writing, \" Would you be able to ask your Mummy and Daddy for me if they know anything more about your great, great grandfather.Royal Collection would love to know more about him. \" Along with his parents\uff0cTom wrote back to fill in all the gaps about Petrus Johannes Arundzen. Although Tom's parents don't think there will be any more letters exchanged between the pair, they were touched that she had taken time to contact them. Tom's father said, \" I don't expect we'll get another one, but I think it's incredible they bothered replying at all. \" ",
