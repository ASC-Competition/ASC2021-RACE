  "article": "The atmosphere and oceans are not the only parts of the environment being damaged. Rain forests are being quickly destroyed as well, and their survival is questionable. E.O. Wilson, a biologist at Harvard, called the depletion   of rain forest areas \"the greatest extinction since the end of the age of dinosaurs\".\nUnlike some environmental issues, rain forest depletion has fortunately received significant public and media attention. Despite the opposition to the cutting down of rain forests, the problem continues. Every year, Brazil chops down an area of forest the size of the state of Nebraska. In addition to the Amazon's rain forests, many other forests are being cut down as well. In Indonesia, Zaire, Papua-new Geinea, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Venezuela, rain forests that were once great have been lost.\nAccording to some estimates, 50 million acres of rain forests are cut down every year. The United Nations says the figure is closer to 17 million acres. The World Wildlife Fund says every minute, 25 to 50 acres are cut or burned to the ground.\nThe world's growing population has been a primary reason of rain forest destruction. More people need land to live on and wood products to consume. Limiting population growth may be the first in a series of steps that would limit the destruction of the rain forests.",
