  "article": "Drownings, bicycle injuries, falls, and pedestrian accidents are the most common causes of childhood injury or death. Here's what you need to know to avoid tragedy:\n*      Drowning: Each year, thousands of children die from drowning, with two-thirds of accidents occurring in the summer. To protect kids, parents should install multiple layers of protective devices, with each layer offering another opportunity to avoid a tragedy. Fences, door alarms, pool covers are all somewhat effective individually, but their effectiveness is increased dramatically when used in combination with one another.\n*      Falls: Falls from heights kill 140 children under the age of 15 each year in the United States, and seriously injure three million more, making falls the leading cause of non-deadly injury for this age group. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), falls are especially a problem for children living in multi-story housing during the summer months, when windows are open and children are more likely to be playing on fire escapes, roofs and balconies. To keep kids safe, AAP recommends window guards be installed on second story and higher windows. When choosing guards, install those that are operable in the event of emergencies like a house fire. Using childproof gates can prevent falls down stairways. Nevertheless, no gate can replace parental supervision  \n*      Bikes: Bike accidents kill over 1,500 children aged 14 and under each year. Of these deaths, more than half occurred during the summer. According to the AAP, head injuries from cycling are the most common cause of disability. A recent study in Seattle, Washington showed that helmets reduced the risk of head injury by 85 percent and brain injury by 88 percent. When purchasing a bike helmet, parents are urged to make sure it meets the bicycle helmet safety standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)\n*      Pedestrian: Over 6,000 kids aged 14 and under die every year as a result of an unintentional pedestrian-related injury. As a general rule, kids under 10 should not be crossing the street alone. Young children lack the ability to judge the speed and the distance of oncoming traffic. Parents need be models and teach proper pedestrian behavior. Cross at the corner and when you do cross, continue to look both ways because there are likely to be more cars turning into your path or people speeding. Obey all the traffic signals.",
