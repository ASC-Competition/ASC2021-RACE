  "article": "In some places around China,the junior high school graduates have to take a P. E. test. The full marks are usually 30 points and it counts for much in the senior high school entrance exam.\nIn Nanjing the test is held in April. Students have the test in their own schools. Each student is tested on three sports. They can choose long jump, basketball dribbling   or volleyball. The _ is for boys and girls can choose the sit-up. Both boys and girls must skip  in the test.\nMost students find the test easy and more than 90%of them can get full marks. That's because they have been training for it during the three whole years. Students in Junior Three usually do lots of practice in P. E. classes. The training makes the test easier than it seems to be.\nStudents in Nanjing don't need to run a lot for the test, but students in Beijing must do lots of running for the test. Running is one of the sports in test. So in P. E. classes, they usually run a lot. Sometimes they have to run 3,000 meters in one class. Most teachers and parents welcome the P. E. test. They say it helps students build up their health and it's really useful.\n,.",
