This is according to a study in which researchers played voice recordings to wild African elephants. The animals showed more fear when they heard the voices of adult Masai men. Usually Masai people hunt elephants, and this suggests that animals have grown to listen for and avoid them. Prof. Karen McComb and Dr Graeme Shannon from the University of Sussex led the study. They explained that in former research they had used similar experiments to show that elephants could tell\u2014from the sound of a lion\u2014whether the animal was a female or a more dangerous male . Prof. McComb wanted to find out if the animals used their very sharp sense of hearing to recognize danger from humans. The scientists recorded Masai men, women and children saying, in their own language, \" Look, look over there, a group of elephants are coming. \" They also recorded Kamba men saying this phrase. Masai people often come across elephants, which can result in violent hunting. Kamba people, however, mainly feed on agriculture, which does not generally bring them into violent touch with the animals. When the team played recordings of these different voices through a hidden speaker, they found that elephant family groups showed more fear in response to the voice of a Masai man, than to a Kamba man's voice. And the adult male Masai voices caused far more violent response than the voices of women or boys.",
