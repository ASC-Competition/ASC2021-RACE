However\uff0con one particular Saturday morning I learnt something perhaps more important. The hospital was in the middle of one of the poorer sections of the city and some people could only pay for the most basic treatments. On this Saturday\uff0ca man and his young son\uff0cwho was probably about 7 years old\uff0cwalked in with a small cat in a cardboard box. There was something wrong with the cat's left eye. But the man could not afford to pay for the cost of the medicine. He kept quiet for a while\uff0cand then he asked where the nearest animal shelter was. Hearing this\uff0chis son cried and started to argue with him. All of a sudden\uff0can older woman who was sitting in the waiting room stood up\uff0cwalked up to the counter\uff0cand told the man that she would pay for the cost. The man thanked her and the son got to keep a healthy cat. I always thought it was the right thing to help out a needy person\uff0cbut I only saw people do acts of kindness on TV or in movies. What the woman did made me believe that these things do happen in real life\uff0cand quite often.Now\uff0cwhen I can't decide whether to help someone who is in need\uff0cI remember this woman\uff0cand then I have the courage to step up to the plate. Sometimes other people follow.",
