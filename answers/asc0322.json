  "article": "We all want to have vacations. To me, it's very important to relax myself. I finished a one-week vacation just now. Let me tell you what I did. I know you will feel bored when you look at other people's vacation pictures!\nMy son finished his last week of school. During that week, I became a school mom. They had a class party at a teacher's house, so I volunteered   to drive some of the students and _ the party. That was the last week my son would be with them. So it was time for me to spend time with them. I had lunch with the class and then attended their meeting. I never had time to be with the class before. I found it very interesting and my son was happy to show off  that.",
