  "article": "One day a father and his rich family took his son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be.\nThey spent a day and a night on the farm of a very poor family. When they got back from their trip, the father asked his son, \"How was the trip?\"\n\"Very good, Dad!\"\n\"Did you see how poor people can be?\" the father asked.\n\"Yeah!\"\n\"And what did you learn?\"\nThe son answered, \"I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four. We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden; they have a creek that has no end. We have imported lamps in the garden; they have the stars. Our patio reaches to the front yard; they have a whole horizon.\"\nWhen the little boy finished, his father was speechless.\nThe son added, \"Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!\"\nIsn't it true that it all depends on the way you look at things? If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude towards life, you've got everything!\nYou can't buy any of these things. You may have all the material possessions you can imagine, provision for the future, etc. But if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing!\n\"Command those who are rich in the things of this life not to be proud, but to place their hope, not in such an uncertain thing as riches, but in God, who generously gives us everything for our enjoyment.\"",
