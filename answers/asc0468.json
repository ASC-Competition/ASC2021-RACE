Second, it tells me that the time is about twelve o'clock. And...\"\n\"What else?\" Holmes asked.\n\"Well, it also reminds me that the world is so big and we are so small. What does that tell you?\" Holmes said with a grin on his face, \"You silly guy! It only tells me that someone has stolen our tent!\"",
