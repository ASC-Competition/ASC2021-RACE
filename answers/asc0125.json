  "article": "Mary went out at night. She never forgot the night when she met a robber many years ago.\nThat evening, she was invited to a birthday party which lasted until two o'clock in the morning. Without company Mary walked along the quiet street.\nSuddenly from the shadow of a dark building a tall man with a sharp knife in his right hand ran out at her. \"Good evening, lady,\" the man said in a low voice, \"I don't think you wish to die here.\"\n\"What do you want?\" Mary asked.\n\"Your earrings  .Take them off!\" Slowly Mary's eyes looked down. She tried to cover her necklace with the collar of her overcoat while she used the other hand to take off both of her earrings, and then she quickly threw them on the ground.\n\"Take them and let me go.\" she said. The robber looked at her only feeling uncertain. He saw the girl didn't care for the earrings at all, only trying to protect the necklace. He realized the necklace would cost more. So he said, \"Give me your necklace.\"\n\"Oh, sir. It's not worth much. Please let me keep it.\"\n\"Stop rubbish. Quick!\"\nWith shaky hands, Mary took off her necklace. As soon as the robber disappeared, she picked up her earrings and ran as fast as she could to one of her friends.\nThe earrings cost 480 pounds and the necklace the robber had taken away cost only six pounds ten shillings.",
