  "article": "Certain plants and animals can survive under what seem like impossible conditions. Blind fish live freely under ocean depths that are  ly dark and cold. Bacteria live at temperatures of 600 degF or a higher in places where the heat comes from the deep earth. One of the most remarkable achievements that we can observe directly is the ability of the plants and animals in the desert.\nIn the Death Valley ,temperatures of 134 degF in the shade have been officially reported Yet lizards live there ,along with 600 species of plants, 30 species of mammals? and even fish. While the days are terribly hot, the nights are extremely cold. Temperatures can fall down by as much as 50 degF.\nPlants called xerophytes are perfectly adapted to the extremely dry conditions. These plants have survived by developing techniques for coping with their environment. Like all living things ,they must have water ,and they get it in several ways.\nThe mesquite and the prickly  pear pick up moisture in opposite ways. The mesquite sends its roots down as deep as 60 feet to tap the water table. The prickly pear, on the other hand ,spreads its roots wide. These roots are shallow but they pick up whatever moisture is available at ground level. The paloverde saves water by shedding leaves in times of extreme drought The barrel cactus makes sure of a water supply by storing water in the plant itself. The saguaro cactus stores so much water that it can survive years of drought. But even the saguaro will die sooner or later if there is no rain. All these plants ,although well adjusted to their environment, must eventually get water.\nEven if the parent plants die, there are always seeds to keep the species alive. Since the desert is so tough, thousands of seeds must be released to produce one plant. To get rooted, these seeds must have exactly the right conditions. They can lie dormant for months, even years, until a little water stimulates the sparks of life.",
