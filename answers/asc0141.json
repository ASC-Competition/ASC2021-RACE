  "article": "An old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and a four-year-old grandson. The family ate together at the dinner table. But the elderly grandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eating rather difficult. Peas rolled onto the floor. When he took the glass, often milk spilled on the tablecloth.\nThe son and daughter-in-law became unhappy with  _ . So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There, grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table. Since grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl.\nSometimes when the family glanced in grandfather's direction, he had a tear in his eyes as he ate alone. Still, the couple blamed him sharply when he dropped a fork or spilled food. The four-year-old son watched it all in silence.\nOne evening, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps   on the floor. He asked the child, \"What are you making?\" The boy responded, \"Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and mama to eat your food from when I grow up.\" The words so struck the parents that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done. That evening the husband took grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table.\nFor the rest of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled. Children are surprisingly  _ . Their eyes always observe, their ears always listen, and their minds always process the messages they get. If they see us patiently provide a happy home atmosphere for family members, they will imitate that attitude for the rest of their lives. The wise parent realizes that every day is being laid for the child's future.",
