  "article": "Postcards to myself\nIn 50 years of traveling Colin McCorpuodale has visited every country in the world, except three.And everywhere he goes,he sends himself a postcard.He always chooses a postcard with a beautiful view,and sticks on an interesting stamp.Usually he writes just a short message to himself.His latest one,from the Malians island,read Good fishing.\nOn a wall in his home in London there is a large map of the world.There are hundreds of little red pins stuck in it.\"It's good to get a pin in the map,\" says Mr.McCorquodale, \"but I follow the rules.I'm allowed to stick one in only if I've  been in a place for more than 24 hours.\"\nNaturally,Mr.McCorpuodale has his favorite places.New Zealand he describes as\"wonderful\".In Europe,he says,\"Italy is a favorite place.But in Italy tourists are worried that they will get ripped off because people there often charge too much for something.\"Of China he says,\"This is one country in the world which is completely different.There is no European influence\".\nWherever he goes,Mr.McCorpuodale takes with him a photo of his wife,a candle,a torch,a shirt with a secret pocket, and a pen for writing his postcards.\nSo why does he do it? For the postcards or the travel?  Mr.McCorpuodale laughs.\"I do it for the journey,\"he says.\"I get a kick out of traveling,and all the planning.\"",
