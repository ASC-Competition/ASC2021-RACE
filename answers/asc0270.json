  "article": "Dear Sir, Our weekend at your hotel was bad. We lived in Room 303. It was big but everything was very old. My father cleaned the room and fixed a broken chair. My mother wanted to read a book but the lamp was too, small. My dad got some noddles from the hotel kitchen, but they were cold and tasted bad. I wanted to watch TV but the TV didn't work. The people in Room 301 listened to loud music. I didn't sleep all night. I'm sorry, but we didn't enjoy our stay very much. Li Lei and family",
