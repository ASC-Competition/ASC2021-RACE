  "article": "Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education. As colleges struggle for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admission standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.\n\"All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,'\" said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lippmann Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. \"There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.\"\n    Not all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research becameprefix = st1 /NewSchoolUniversityto reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it theNewSchool.\nNow, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of \"naming structures\", \"brand architecture\" and \"identity systems\", the university has  _ a new name: theNewSchool. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words \"theNewSchool\".\n    Changes in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted. In changing its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east ofSan Francisco.\n    Beaver College turned itself intoArcadiaUniversityin 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to put an end to jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and \"morning zoo\" radio shows.\nMany college officials said changing a name and image could produce vital results. At Arcadia, in addition to the rise in applications, the average student's test score has increased by 60 points, Juli Roebeck, an Arcadiaspokeswoman, said.",
