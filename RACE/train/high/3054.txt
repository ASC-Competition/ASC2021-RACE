I knew I couldn't take everything with me, but I kept asking myself \"how could I possibly throw this away?\", \"what if I need it one day?\", and \"what about all of the memories?\" Now that I've moved, and left that stuff behind, I don't even miss it. Whether or not I got rid of it, it barely makes a bit of difference to me now.\nI've learned that over time people forget, or their need for a particular object eventually disappears. Either they store it away or they get rid of it.\nYou might think nostalgically  about the toys you cared about when you were a child, but what is making you smile now is not the thing itself but the memory of it. 1've heard it a hundred times, \"you don't need things to make you happy.\" It takes something life-changing like moving across the country to realize how true this is.\nSpeaking of which, for a lot of people, minimalism is about able to move. It's about being able to go almost anywhere at any time because you don't have many possessions to carry. When you keep things you don't need they become a burden that ties you to a place. Moving to university was a good time to let go of a lot of stuff. And when I visit for the holidays, I'll probably get rid of even more, to lighten the burden.\n _ There are some things that are irreplaceable, very rare or expensive or we simply love and cherish for some reason or another, since we are humans. But after we keep those, how much is left that we don't really need?\nHence, minimalism. And why does minimalism bring happiness? That was a bit of a roundabout way of saying that, it's because what really makes me happy is freedom. And the key to freedom is minimalism because minimalism reduces our attachment to things.\nAttachment to too many objects creates a great mess and can severely hold back our freedom to do whatever we want, while minimalism helps us start new projects, move, travel, learn new things, work, expand, be debt-free, be healthy - really living life to our full potential.\nI left the nest to fly onwards and upwards, I can't do it with old things weighing me down. And that is why I have adopted minimalism with open arms.", "id": "high3054.txt"}
