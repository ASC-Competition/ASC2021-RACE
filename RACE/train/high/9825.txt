The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spray 'Sprayable Energy' contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup.\nThe website said: \"The reason for this is our product isn't entirely metabolized  by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.\" Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as wrists, the neck or behind the ears, but warns users not to exceed 20 times a day.\nIt claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel awake and focus without being over-excited, which is common with coffee and energy drinks.", "id": "high9825.txt"}
