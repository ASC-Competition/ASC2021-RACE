This saying is all about the importance of breakfast. And now scientists can tell us just why it's so important. According to a study carried out at Imperial College London, UK, skipping the first meal of the day not only means you eat more at lunch, but also that your brain wants to find more unhealthy foods.\nThe study suggests that there is a special part of our brain called the orbitofrontal cortex  , which plays an important part in making choices about what we eat. It is used for identifying the taste of food, especially when skipping breakfast. It is more likely to target high-calorie foods when you're on an empty stomach.\nScientists did an experiment on this. Dr Tony Goldstone from Imperial College London, scanned   the brains of 21 men and women, around the age of 25. On the first day, these people skipped breakfast before the scans. On the second day, they had cereal  , bread and jam as breakfast. After the scan on both days, they had their lunch.\nWhen the volunteers had skipped breakfast, they ate around 20 percent more at lunch, compared with days when they had eaten breakfast.Their brain scans also showed the orbitofrontal cortex was especially responsive to high-calorie foods. \"We believe that bit identifies the value of foods - how pleasant, how delicious something is,\" Goldstone told The Guardian.", "id": "high8940.txt"}
