They found that the common belief that being positive in the workplace produces positive outcomes, while negative emotions lead to negative outcomes, may be in need for reconsideration. This is partly due to this belief failing to take into account the differences in working environment which affect outcomes.\nFor instance, anger does not always lead to negative outcomes and in some cases, anger can be considered a force for good through acting upon injustices. An employee, for example, could express anger constructively after a manager has treated a fellow worker unfairly. In such cases, anger can be useful. _ , being too positive in the workplace, rather than resulting in greater performance and productivity, can lead to self-satisfaction and being too shallow in one's personality.\nOne article within the issue also finds that, within team work situation, negativity can have  a good effect, leading to fewer consensuses   but a further discussion or debate on an important issue among workers, which improve team effect.\nLindebaum said, \"The findings of the study published in this Special Issue challenge the common belief that in the workplace positive emotions bring about a positive outcome, and vice versa .\"\nHe added, \"This Special Issue adds to our knowledge and understanding of how the positive and negative dynamics   affect the working environment and is certain to have practical application in the workplace for the years to come.\"", "id": "high8977.txt"}
