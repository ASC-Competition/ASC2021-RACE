They play a constant cat-and-mouse game with store and restaurant employees and managers. However it's not all fun and games. Once in the field, a mystery shopper will typically visit several stores or restaurants per hour, taking mental notes while inside, then jotting down physical notes after they leave.\nIt's important for mystery shoppers to be as exact as possible, because the client companies are looking for data they can use to improve their service. The questionnaire won't say, \"Does the trash can need to be emptied?\" What an educated shopper will say is, \"The trash can to the left of the front door was overflowing with 10 pieces of trash on the ground.\" Companies don't need opinion but facts.\nNowadays mystery shoppers are armed with a number of high-tech devices, such as a digital scale and a digital thermometer, as well as a handheld PC for recording the entire experience. It's a challenging job but a rewarding one. Mystery shoppers can be full time or part time, but the full-time workers tend to stick to standard mystery shopping while part-timers often choose the less complex reward-based programs. In _ , the shoppers stay disguised  only until the \"shop\" is finished, and then reveal   themselves to the store management and award prizes to employees who provided excellent service.\nTo be a mystery shopper, it's important to be a good observer, but sometimes it's important to have the right profile , too. Companies often hire shoppers from particular backgrounds to better blend in with clients' regular customers. If a secret shopper will be sent in, for example, to do a high-end automotive shop, the candidate must have a particular profile that meets a high-end, luxury car-type buyer profile. \"It's a challenge to perform your shop without being discovered,\" Ms. Clark said, \"because most of the people that we work for are very aware of the mystery shopping program.\"", "id": "high22316.txt"}
