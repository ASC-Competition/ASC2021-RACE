And it seems Vienna still has plenty to feel proud of, as it has been named the best place to live in the world -- for the third year running. The Austrian capital, which was home to Mozart and Beethoven, and has a population of 1.7million, has the best living standards in the world, according to an annual quality of living survey.\nEuropean cities represent more than half of the top 25 cities in the rankings, which are based on factors such as crime, food and climate.
