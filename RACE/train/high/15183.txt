The equipment was in Aspen, and they expected it to be repaired soon.\nSoon shortly turned to much later, and during the delay, weather temporarily closed the Aspen airport.The weather cleared in Aspen and the plane took off very late for Denver.While it was in the air, the agent announced that the plane would be used for the next flight and that our flight was being cancelled.\nThis cancellation struck me as being unfair.There was a mad scramble   as the 50 or so passengers scheduled for our flight fought for seats on later flights.When the dust settled, we were wait-listed on the 9'-00 flight the next morning.We had to spend the night in the airport.\nComing home was no better.Because of a mechanical problem, it looked like we would miss our connection in Denver.The agent assured us they would hold the Newark flight for us.Needless to say, the flight to Houston taxied out as we pulled into the gate.Arrangements were made for us to take the next flight, so we sat in the airport for 5 hours.When we finally arrived in Houston, our skis were missing.As of this writing, the skis have not been found.\nNothing you can do will make us feel better about our flights.If you are a responsible business, however, you will do what you can to see that passengers in the future are treated better.\nWith great displeasure,\nPhyllis Dooley", "id": "high15183.txt"}
