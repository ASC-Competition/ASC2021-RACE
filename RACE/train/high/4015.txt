The Germans won, ahead of the Russians and Turks. The stereotype of German humourlessness is believed to _ from their reputation for efficiency, punctuality and rationality . Examples of German jokes include: \"Yesterday, I met my friend Horst at the hospital. He'd swallowed a sponge. He says it doesn't hurt but he's always thirsty.\"\n\"When we meet someone new, one of the first things we notice is whether they make us laugh\", says Lloyd Price, Badoo's Marketing Director. \"America is a worthy poll winner\", says Price. \"It's the world's only comedy superpower.\"\nThe British pride themselves on their humour but learn from the poll that they're not as funny as they think. They placed just seventh of 15 --- behind the Brazilians, French and Mexicans.", "id": "high4015.txt"}
