We see them frequently in TV situation comedies and in movies like Revenge of the _ . They get high grades, all right, but only by becoming dull laborers, their noses always stuck in a book. They are not good at social communication and look clumsy while doing sports.\nHow, then, do we account for Domenica Roman or Paul Melendres?\nRoman is on the tennis team at Fairmont Senior High School. She also sings in the choral group, serves on the student council and is a member of the mathematics society. For two years she has maintained A's in every subject. Melendres, a freshman at the University of New Mexico, was student-body president at Valley High School in Albuquerque. He played soccer and basketball well, exhibited at the science fair, and meanwhile worked as a reporter on a local television station. Being a speech giver at the graduation ceremony, he achieved straight A's in his regular classes, plus bonus points for A's in two college-level courses.\nHow do super-achievers like Roman and Melendres do it? Brains aren't the only answer. \"Top grades don't always go to the brightest students, \" declares Herbert Walberg, a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who has conducted major studies on super-achieving students. \"Knowing how to make the most of your innate abilities counts for more. Much more.\"\nIn fact, Walberg says, students with high IQ sometimes don't do as well as classmates with lower IQ. For them, learning comes too easily and they never find out how to get down.\nHard work isn't the whole story, either. \"It's not how long you sit there with the books open, \" said one of the many-A students we interviewed. \"It's what you do while you're sitting.\" Indeed, some of these students actually put in fewer hours of homework time than their lower-scoring classmates.\nThe kids at the top of the class get there by mastering a few basic techniques that others can readily learn.", "id": "high1049.txt"}
