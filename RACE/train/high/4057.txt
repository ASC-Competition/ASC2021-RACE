It was a strange place. Martin and Tom wished that they had not accepted Jack's _ . They liked camping, but not near this swamp.\n\"So,\" Martin asked as they sat watching the hot coals. \"How did this place get its name?\"\n\"Are you sure you want to hear it ? It's a scary story,\" warned Jack.\n\"Of course!\" cried out Tom. \"If there were anything to be scared of, you wouldn't have chosen this place!\"\n\"Ok, but don't say I didn't warn you,\" said Jack, and he began this tale.\n\"Way back in time, a man called Dennis tried to start a farm here. He built that cottage over there to live in. In those days, the area looked quite different ---- it was covered with tall trees and the swamp was a crystal-clear river. After three hard years, Dennis had cleared several fields and planted crops. He was so proud of his success that he refused to listen to advice.\n\"'You are clearing too much land,' warned one old man. ' The land is a living thing. It will hit back at you if you abuse it. '\n\"'Silly fool,' said Dennis to himself. 'If I clear more land, I can grow more crops. I'll become wealthier. He's just jealous!'\"\n\"Dennis continued to chop down trees. Small animals that relied on them for food and shelter were destroyed. He was so eager to expand his farm that he did not notice the river flowing slowly towards his door. He did not notice salt seeping to the surface of the land. He did not notice swamp plants choking all the native plants.\"\n\"What happened?\" Martin asked. It was growing colder. He trembled, twisting his body closer to the fire.\n\"The land hit back ---- just as the old man warned,\" Jack shrugged. \"Dennis disappeared. Old folks around here believe that swamp plants moved up from the river and dragged him underwater. His body was never found.\"\n\"What a stupid story,\" laughed Tom. \"Plants can't ...\" Before he had finished speaking, he screamed and fainted  . The other two boys jumped up with fright, staring at Tom. Suddenly, they burst out laughing. Some green swamp ivy   had covered Tom's face. It was a while before Tom could appreciate the joke.", "id": "high4057.txt"}
