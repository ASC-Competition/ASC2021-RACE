About 30 percent of Chinese respondents said they worry about who will look after them in later years, while 91 percent agreed the government of the world's most populous nation should improve care for the elderly.\nHowever, because people in China think about their future earlier, research suggests the country could be one of the best prepared for addressing the aging problem. About one third of Chinese respondents--more than double the global average--said they have put money aside for retirement, while 46 percent have taken out insurance, the poll showed. Despite being one of the best prepared nations, three fifths of those surveyed in China expect their family to care for them when they can no longer do so themselves.\nA Bupa-sponsored report,however, revealed that the \"informal care network\" (the traditional pattern of families looking after the elderly) is disintegrating. This is due to a number of factors, said the report, including structural changes to the population, the increase of women in employment, the increase of one-person households and the rise in divorce rates.\nThe first batch of Chinese couples with only one child are largely in their 50s or 60s because the country's family planning policy was adopted in the late 1970s.\nLi Yinping, 55, a retired accountant, said she thinks only people in their 70s can be called old. She said her pension is enough to support her in later years and that her only hope is that her son can visit regularly. \"I don't worry about my later years at all,\" said Li. \"When I'm old, I can turn to a rest home. The local hospital can deliver the medicine I need with just a phone call.\"\nXiao Zhe, a 26-year-old computer engineer in Beijing, is an only child whose parents live in his hometown of Chongqing. \"I'm so busy with my work that I can't go back to visit them often,\" he said. \"When they're not able to care for themselves, I will hire a nurse to look after them.\"\nChina will become the oldest society in the world by 2030, according to a recent report by a Beijing-based government think tank. The United Nations also forecasts that people aged 60 and over will account for 28 percent of the country's total population by 2040.", "id": "high22155.txt"}
