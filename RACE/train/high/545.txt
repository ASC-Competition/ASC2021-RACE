(AP)--Mike dropped out of college to support his pregnant  girlfriend and now works as a manager of a trucking company, Lynn graduated with honors from Harvard University and was hired as a lawyer with a top law firm in a major city. What do these two people have in common? Ten years ago they were both high school valedictorians  .\nA University of Illinois study follows the lives of 81 valedictorians and salutatorians   who graduated a decade ago from public and private high schools in the state.\nTales of Success and Failure\nThe study found tales of success and failure. The research on 46 women and 35 men found that some were doctors and scientists, one was a drug addict, another was a waitress with emotional problems.\n\"There is a popular idea about people who do well in school doing well in life,\" said Terry Denny, professor of education. Denny conducted the study with Karen Arnold, a former graduate student of Denny' s who is now a professor at Boston College. Denny and Arnold contacted the 81 students before graduation, and then followed up with interviews nearly every other year. They also sent them questionnaires in the mail.\nVaried Careers\nOne-third of the students are lawyers, or have a doctorate. Nineteen are in business and 15 are engineers or computer scientists. Others include a farmer, a stock broker, and an aerobics instructor.\nArnold says many of the students have only average positions in the work world and that \"most are not headed for greatness in their careers.\" Denny, however, says that it is too early to make such predictions. \"Who expects someone to be on the Supreme Court at the age of 28 or to be the discoverer of an important scientific invention right after college?\" he said. \"These students are just getting started in life. They are just beginning to find out what life is all about.\"", "id": "high545.txt"}
