My taxi driver stepped on his brake, skidded , and missed the black car's back end by just inches! The driver of the black car, who almost caused a major accident, turned his head angrily and started shouting bad words at us.\nMy taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. I mean, my taxi driver was friendly. So, I said, \"Why did you just do that? This guy almost ruined your car and sent us to hospital!\" And the following is what my taxi driver told me, which I now call \"the law of the Garbage Truck\".\n\"Many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of anger, and full of disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it. And if you let them, they dump it on you. When someone wants to dump on you, don't take it personally. Just smile, wave, wish him well, and move on. Believe me. You'll be happier.\"\nSo this is \"The Law of the Garbage Truck\". I started thinking: How often do I let \"Garbage Trucks\" run right over me? And how often do I take their garbage and spread it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets? It was then that I said, \"I'm not going to do it any more.\"\nI began to see \"Garbage Trucks\". I see _ they're carrying. I see them coming to drop it off. And like my taxi driver, I don't make it a personal thing; I just smile, wave, and move on.\nGood leaders know they have to be ready for their next meeting. Good parents know that they have to welcome their children home from school with hugs and kisses. What about you? The mark of a successful person is how quickly he can get back his focus on what's important.", "id": "high437.txt"}
