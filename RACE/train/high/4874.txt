Soon I was able to pronounce the four words clearly, and said them whenever an American tried to talk to me. This answer was very effective at ending our conversation and saving me from another uncomfortable situation, or I would have to communicate in a language that I was not familiar with.\nBefore coming to the States, I thought I knew English pretty well. But the truth is that the grammar and vocabulary-based English that is taught in schools overseas is not the English people speak in America.\nBut fear not! Once you are in America, you can immediately begin to bridge the gap between the learned English that you already know, and the spoken English that is all around you. To do this, first of all, it is important not to fear when you realize that you may not be as prepared for daily communication as you thought. For me, as soon as I stopped worrying about my accent and started speaking, I made rapid progress. Often the people didn't notice my mistakes because they were so glad to finally be able to communicate with me.\nAnother good idea is to listen carefully and pay attention to the way in which ideas are expressed. For example, if you are working hard and you want to stop working and rest for a little while, you can either say \"I would like to stop working and rest for a while\" or \"I want to take a quick break from work.\" The first sentence, I quickly learned, sounds dry and too formal for any kind of communication, while the second is an idiom that is widely used in American English conversation.\nFinally, use what you already know---the vocabulary, the grammar and the spelling. Try to use these into the spoken language for more impressive and accurate speaking results.", "id": "high4874.txt"}
