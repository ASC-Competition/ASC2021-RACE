Here are some responses:\nDiane Burke of Weeks bury, Kentucky\nI think it would definitely be an interesting combination. Everyone recognizes the names Yahoo and Microsoft, but everyone also says, \"Did you Google it?\" Such a catchphrase   is going to be hard to beat.\nShaun Carney of Laurelville, Ohio\nI think the merger   will provide more competitions for Google. I don't think the merger will allow Microsoft to develop faster than Google, though. I believe the increased competition this merger brings will force Google to stay on top of its game by offering more fresh and original Internet tools and expanding on the tools it already offers.\nToni Suarez of Hacienda Heights, California\nI view the merger as a necessary element in preventing a monopolization  . Perhaps it would bring better high technology innovations to e-mail and help in researching and developing a better Internet!\nRick R. of Edgewater, Florida\nIt sounds like a disaster to me. If this were to happen, I would stop using my Yahoo e-mail account because I don't like the feeling of Microsoft spying upon my business. I will sign up for Google.\nAntonio Glosser of Kansas City, Missouri\nRight now, Yahoo offers a lot of features and tools at no cost for all different levels of Internet users. Microsoft seeks nothing but profit. Undoubtedly, they'll do nothing other than find ways to start removing Yahoo's formerly non-priced features. Microsoft's greed will ruin the great thing that Yahoo currently is.", "id": "high6301.txt"}
