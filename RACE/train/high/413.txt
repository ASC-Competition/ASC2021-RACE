This is the result of a study of 51,000 women over ten years, published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association.\nOne theory is that caffeine reduces the  effect of the chemical adenosine  in the brain, which can make us feel sleepy by slowing down nerve cell activity. Some anti-depressants also work by blocking the adenosine receptors. Coffee was found to be far more influential on depression levels than hot chocolate or tea due to the high caffeine content.\n*How many eggs can we healthily eat: one a day or two a day?\nNeither-eat them freely. We've long been warned to stick to two or three eggs a week because of their high cholesterol content. But according to the Food Standards Agency, there is no recommended limit to how many eggs we can healthily eat, unless you have been told to cut down by your doctor.\nThere is no evidence that eating eggs raises cholesterol levels, and researchers found that eggs contain less cholesterol than in the past because hens are no longer given bone meal, which was banned in the 1990s after the BSE  cresis.\nResearch by the British Egg Council found that a medium egg gives you around 100 mg of cholesterol, a third of the 300mg recommended daily limit.", "id": "high413.txt"}
