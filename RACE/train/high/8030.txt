As he was very busy, the letter lay on his desk till tea-time. Then he opened it and aPS10 note fell out onto his desk. With the note was a short letter. This is what it said:\nDear sir,\nIn 1935 I got engaged. But unfortunately at that time there was a lot of unemployment and I lost my job. I was six months without a job and then I got work again. But of course I was very short of money. I came to your shop to buy a wedding ring. The assistant brought some rings for me to look at, but she was called away for a moment, and I put one of the rings in my pocket. When she came back, I said I did not know the size of my girl-friend's finger. So I left the shop without buying a ring.\nMy wife died a short while ago and the fact that I never paid for her ring has been on my conscience   all these years. At the time the ring cost PS2 so I reckon   that is about PS10 at today's price. And I am sending you that amount.\nYours truly,\nA customer\n\"Well, well, well,\" said the manager, \"life is full of surprises!\"", "id": "high8030.txt"}
