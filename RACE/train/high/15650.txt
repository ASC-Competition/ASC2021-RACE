It is practiced at objects which are properly monitored and usually quite safe. Only certain handguns are true \"sporting weapons\", seen as such by the sport's lovers.\nOn the other hand, shooting at tin cans and other small objects in one's backyard is not and should not be considered a serious sport. When uncontrolled, it can be a very dangerous practice.\nSome opponents   of handgun control have stated that we are out to stop all hunting and that controlling the handgun would severely affect hunting. That is simply untrue. Handgun control would in no way limit the freedom of the true hunter. Few if any hunters consider the handgun an effective hunting weapon.\nThere are a few hunters who do hunt with handguns, but most states place restrictions   on the type of guns that can be used in hunting, the reason is that killing of game should be done in as humane   a way as possible. Some small handguns are more likely to wound the animal rather than kill it at once. Only long guns, rifles and shotguns are effective arms of hunting.\nPeople must understand that handguns and hunters are separate matters. Because most of the hunters use a rifle or shotgun, there is no reason why their search for game and sport should be affected by handgun control. Mixing the anti-hunting matter with the handgun matter confuses the killing of animals with killing of people.", "id": "high15650.txt"}
