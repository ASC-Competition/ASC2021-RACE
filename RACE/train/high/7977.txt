He has successfully climbed to the top of the highest mountain in Africa, and most importantly, he's changed the attitude of any normal person who watches him compete.\nThe 17-year-old teenager has one leg. He was born that way, but his goal is to show it's not the one thing that defines him. He would also be the first one to tell you that he just wants to prove to others and himself that he's just like other normal ones.\nWhen Calabria was young, his parents tried different prostheses to find out which was most comfortable for their son as he tried to keep up with the family, who has a preference for sports.\nAt first, the Calabrias had their middle child in a prosthesis that looked and functioned like a real leg, but soon they decided to choose a different path when they found it wasn't beneficial to his movement. Then the family moved him to arm crutches and from there a new burst of energy was found.\nGetting others to believe that he could take off on the soccer field took a little bit longer.
