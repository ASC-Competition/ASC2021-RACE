Once in the water, it reacts to form carbonic acid. \nScientists believe that the oceans have already become slightly more acidic over the last century.\nBut these researchers have tried to predict what will happen in the future by combining what we know about the history of the oceans with computer models of climate change.\n\"This level of acidity will get much more extreme in the future if we continue releasing CO2 into the atmosphere,\" said Dr Caldeira.\n\"And we predict amounts of future acidity will exceed anything we have seen over the last several hundred million years, let alone perhaps after rare catastrophic events such as asteroid impacts .\"\nIf carbon dioxide release continues unabated , ocean pH could be reduced by as much as 0.77 units, the authors warn.\nIt is not  ly clear what that means for marine life, however.\nMost organisms live near the surface, where the greatest pH change would be expected to occur, but deep-ocean lifeforms may be more sensitive to pH changes.\nCoral reefs and other organisms whose skeletons or shells contain calcium carbonate may be particularly affected, the team speculate. They could find it much more difficult to build these structures in water with a lower pH.\nIn recent years some people have suggested deliberately storing carbon dioxide from power stations in the deep ocean as a way of curbing global warming. But Dr Caldeira said that such a strategy should now be re-considered.\n\"Previously, most experts had looked at ocean absorption of carbon dioxide as a good thing - because in releasing CO2 into the atmosphere we warm the planet; and when CO2 is absorbed by the ocean, it reduces the amount of greenhouse warming.", "id": "high23540.txt"}
