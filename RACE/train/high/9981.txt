There is increasing evidence to show that reading isn't merely a way of improving literacy and knowledge, but that it might actually be good for one's mental and physical health, too.\nIn the age of Twitter and short attention spans, reading novels, which requires intense concentration over a long period of time, could be the antidote .\nNeuroscientists Baroness Susan Greenfield says that reading helps to lengthen attention spans in children and improve their ability to think clearly. \"Stories have a structure that encourages our brain to think in sequence, to link cause, effect and significance,\" she says \"It is essential to learn this skill as a small child.\"\n\"In a computer game, you might rescue a princess, but you don't care about her, you just want to win,\" she explains, \"But a princess in a book has a past, present and future.

This doesn't happen when we are watching a TV or playing computer games.\"\nGetting stuck in a good novel appears to be good for one's mental health. Reading helps one not only fights loneliness, but also forget one's own problems for a while.\nResearchers found that just six minutes of reading could reduce stress levels by more than two-thirds, more than listening to music or going out for a walk.
