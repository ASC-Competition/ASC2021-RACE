Do you stop to help? In a study of by-standers, it was found that some people avert their gaze and keep on  walking rather than stop and get involved.\n\"There is a tendency to decide that no action is needed.\" says a psychologist. \"The first thoughts that pop into your mind often keep you from offering help. In order to take action, you have to work against them.\" Here are some common thoughts that might prevent you from helping.\n* Why should I be the one? I'm probably not the most competent  person in this crowd. You might think someone older or with more medical knowledge should offer assistance.\n* What if he doesn't really need my help?

Sometimes it's just a matter of turning to the person next to you and saying, 'It looks like we should do something.' Or asking someone if an ambulance has been called and, if not, to call for one. Once you take action, most people will follow you.\"", "id": "high2873.txt"}
