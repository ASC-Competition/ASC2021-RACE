S. Transportation Security Administration, which has used hundreds of the scanners as a way to screen millions of airline passengers for explosives hidden under clothing.\nThe European Commission, which enforces common policies of the EU's 27 member countries, adopted the rule \"in order not to risk doing harm to citizens' health and safety.\"\nAs a ProPublica/PBS NewsHour investigation detailed earlier this month, X-ray body scanners use ionizing radiation  ,a form of energy that has been shown to damage DMA and cause cancer. Although the amount of radiation is extremely low, equal to the radiation a person would receive in a few minutes of flying, several research studies have concluded that a small number of cancer cases would result from scanning hundreds of millions of passengers a year.\nEuropean countries will be allowed to use an alternative body scanner relying on radio frequency waves, which have not been linked to cancer. The U. S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has also used hundreds of those machines --known as millimeter-wave scanners --in U. S. airports. But unlike Europe, it has decided to use both types of scanners.\nThe TSA would not comment specifically on the EU 's decision. But in a statement, TSA spokesman Mike McCarthy said, \"As one of our many layers of security, TSA uses the most advanced technology available to provide the best opportunity to detect dangerous items, such as explosives.\n\" We strictly test our technology to ensure it meets our high detection and safety standards before it is placed in airports,\" he continued. \"Since January 2010, advanced imaging technology has detected more than 300 dangerous or illegal items on passengers in U. S. airports nationwide.\"\nBody scanners have been controversial  in the United States since they were first used in prisons in the late 1990s and then in airports for tests after 9/11.", "id": "high19330.txt"}
