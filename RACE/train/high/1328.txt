English is among them.\nScientists say that this sleep study method greatly speeds language learning. They say that the ordinary person can learn two or three times as much during sleep as in the same period during the day--and this does not affect   his rest in any way. However, sleep teaching will only put into your head what you have studied already while you are awake.\nIn one experiment, ten lessons were broadcast over the radio for two weeks. Each lesson lasted twelve hours -- from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. The first three hours of English grammar and vocabulary   were given with the students awake. At 11 p.m. a lullaby   was broadcast to send the student to sleep and for the next three hours the radio in a soft and low voice broadcast the lesson again into his sleeping ears. At 2 a.m. a sharp noise was sent over the radio to wake the sleeping student up for a few minutes to go over the lesson. The soft music sent him back to rest again while the radio went on. At 5 o'clock his sleep ended and he had to go through the lesson again for three hours before breakfast.", "id": "high1328.txt"}
