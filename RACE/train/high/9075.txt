The planet, named OCLE-TR-56b, has temperatures of more than 3,000 degF. \"This is the hottest planet we know about,\" says Dr. Dimitar Sasselov, a scientist who led the discovery team, \"It is hot enough to have an iron fog and to rain hot iron droplets \"\nThe new planet is 30 times farther away than any planet discovered by scientists before. It is in the Milky Way but it is not in our solar system The new planet moves around a star much like our sun, however. Scientists discovered the planet by using a new planet-searching method, called\"transit technique\" They were able to catch sight of the planet when it moved in front of its star, causing the star's light to dim .Scientists compare the method to discovering the shadow of a bee flying in front of a searchlight 200 miles away. \"We believe the door has been opened wide to go and discover planets like Earth,\" says Sasedlov.", "id": "high9075.txt"}
