Most evidenced shows that women are still in the lowest class of management and in the lowest-paying industries.\nI first noticed that girls were different from boys when I was about 4 years old. No experiences either in my personal life or in my business life have caused me to change my opinion. Throughout my adult life, however, I have had to evaluate again and again these differences between men and women and how they affect the way men and women relate to one another and to the environment in which they work. Working with women has given me deep understanding I would never have gained in any other way.\nWomen are working at a decided disadvantage in the business world created by men to make things comfortable for men.
