But she takes half an hour to do something I can do in ten minutes. She always has a story to tell me and stops working when she does. My boss is angry at both of us, but It's not my fault. I don't want to rat on her, but what else can I do?\n                                                         Flustered\nDear Flustered,\n    Let me propose a better way. Make a log of all the tasks you share, then suggest to your boss that for efficiency your duties could be divided into two separate checklists. If he's reluctant, go to plan B: the next time this girl starts telling you a story, stop working to listen and call your boss over to hear what a great storyteller she is. I'm sure he'll take it from here.\n                                                         Aunty\nDear Aunty,\n  I'm a college student in the Philippines who wants to be wise with money. I'm not an economics or business major student and I don't know anything about stocks. But I really want to buy assets and invest. I receive about 15,000 pesos every school term from my education plan. I don't have any idea how I should spend it. I don't want to just buy new clothes, or hang out with my friends because it would not be wise. I want my money to grow. Please enlighten me.\n                                                      Fastbreakplay\nDear Fastbreakplay,\n    Being wise with money is the No. 1 thing to learn. Start with a disciplined and systematic savings plan. When your savings reach a sizeable amount, then you may start investing. In the meantime, invest in yourself by reading up on stock markets and capital markets. Follow the news. Before I started investing during my senior high school years, I had already studied stock market data of the past century as I believe markets tend to repeat themselves. If you master this skill, you will master your reading of the markets.\n                                                       Aunty", "id": "high23229.txt"}
