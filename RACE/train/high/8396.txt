So when I got my schedule ,it read:  Staff F. It was during _ hat I  realised that \"Staff F\" was Mr.  Sultan. When he called my name, he asked if I remembered him. Then I realised that he was the teacher who had taught me English when I was in primary school.\nMr. Sultan was a very special teacher. Even though he was older and had been to college, but he was Still ready to learn from others. He would listen to your opinion carefully before expressing his opinion.\nI think what he taught me more than anything else is to have an open mind Another thing I couldn't forget was his teaching method -group work\nThere were four members in the group. Each group had its own topic. Everyone in the group would play a certain role. One would keep the discussion moving, the other one would write down the thoughts of the group, another one would be responsible for gathering information, and another one would share everything the group had discovered with the rest of the class. This allowed us to become \"experts\" on one topic and teach the rest of our classmates.\nNow ,I have become a more open-minded boy. That is because of my two and a half years in Mr.  Sultan's class.", "id": "high8396.txt"}
