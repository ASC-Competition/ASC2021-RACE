Well, they might be right, according to the latest research. City residents are more likely to develop mental illnesses than those who live in villages, a study has found.\nResearchers from Cardiff university examined the lifestyles of more than 200,000 people in Sweden and found that those who lived in urban areas were more at risk from mental illnesses than people who lived in villages.\nThe experts don't know exactly why this is but they suggest that town and city residents are more likely to be ostracized  by those around them. They are more likely to experience discrimination  if they do not fit in, which can lead to them feeling anxious and even developing mental illnesses.\nDr Stanley Zammit, who led the research said that people living in towns and cities are more likely to develop other mental illnesses that result in personality changes -- a condition known as non-affective psychosis .\nEarlier this year an official report found that village-dwellers live an average of two years longer than those living in towns and cities. According to figures from the Office of National Statistics in the UK, men who live in villages are likely to live for between 78 and 79 years, while those in towns and cities can expect to survive to an age of 76. Women on average survive to their 81stbirthday in towns and cities, but live to between 82 and 83 in villages.
