But, prefix = st1 /USDirector Shawn Levy attempts to do this on film in the recently released Night at the Museum. \nThe film is adapted from Milan Trenc's book of the same name. It brings to life a world where dinosaurs wander the earth, a former president rides again, warlike early Asians return, and cowboys and Roman soldiers seek to bring back their old goals. \nThe familiar comedy star Ben Stiller acts as a luckless dreamer named Larry Daley. He takes a position as night watchman at the New York Museum of Natural History. \nOn Larry's first night, he's left alone by the three aging guards he's replacing. They fail to inform him of the museum's rather unusual nightlife. \nSoon Larry finds himself chased down the hallways by the very lively skeleton of a dinosaur, in the middle of a confrontation  with Asian warriors. He is caught in a territorial battle between a cowboy and a Roman general and meets face-to-face with former USpresident Teddy Roosevelt, played by Robin Williams. They are each from an exhibit that has come to life through the magic of a priceless Egyptian tablet. \nWhile the film fails to develop very much in some areas (for example, Larry's troubled relationship with a son), it does have enough special effects, and jokes to engage the audience. \nBottom Line: Definitely not Oscar-worthy, but a great way to relax during a holiday.", "id": "high16787.txt"}
