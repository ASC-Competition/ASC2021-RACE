He sold lemonade and cookies to raise money for a school in Haiti. Later, Alex sent 15 bags of food he collected from his neighbors to a food store near his home which asked for donations .\nAlex wanted to help more people. He decided to donate to Heifer International, an organization that gives farm animals and farm training to poor people around the world. His goal: $5,000 for a \"gift ark\". That amount would mean that 15 pairs of animals would be given to people in need. Those families would agree to give one of their animals' young to other needy families.\nAlex decided that baking was the best way to raise money. He started a business, named it Clean Hands Bakery, and now sells his baked goods year round. In his family's kitchen, he created all kinds of cookies and cakes. He says his top sellers are lemon pound cakes and chocolate cupcakes. Alex likes the baking as much as the fundraising. \"I like it that you can take so many ingredients  that don't taste good on their own and come up with something amazing,\" he says.\nIn September 2011, Alex reached his goal of $5,000 and bought a gift ark. \"I feel absolutely overjoyed that I got to my goal,\" he says. \"I can't help everybody by myself, but I can do my part, which I hope will inspire other people to do their part, too.\" One of the people Alex has already inspired is his younger brother. \"He had people donate to me, instead of giving him a birthday present.\" Alex explains. \"In the end he donated $200 toward my goal.\"\nSo now that he's met his goal of a gift ark, will Alex keep baking and fundraising? He says yes. He wants to end world hunger, one cupcake at a time.", "id": "high3218.txt"}
