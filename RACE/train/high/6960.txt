I always encourage such people, but I also explain that there is a big difference between being a writer and writing. In most cases these people are dreaming of wealth and being famous, not the long hours alone at the typewriter.\nWhen I became a writer, I had no future. What I had was a friend called George. He found me a home. It was cold and had no bathroom. I could only afford a used typewriter. A year later, however, I still hadn't received a break and began to doubt myself. But I knew I wanted to write. I would keep putting my dream to the test--even though it meant living with fear of failure. This is the shadow land   of hope, and anyone with a dream must learn to live there. Then one day I got a call from a friend who asked me to be an assistant for $6,000 a year. As the dollars were dancing in my head, _ brought me to my sense. \"Thanks, but no,\" I heard myself saying. After that, I walked around my little room and started to feel like a fool. I felt a little low.\nLater, I gradually began to sell my articles. It was after 17 years of being a writer that Roots was published.
