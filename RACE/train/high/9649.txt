We are always asking questions such as \"Have you ever eaten?\" and \"What did you have for lunch?\"Yet, if you travel from one country to another, you might find that other nations think differently about food. People plan to think that what they eat is normal and what everyone else eats is strange. In most parts of Asia, for example, no meal is complete without rice but in England, rice is the exception and people prefer to eat potatoes, in the Middle East, bread accompanies every meal.\nEating, like so many things we do, becomes a habit that is difficult to change. The Americans seem to like drinking lots of orange juice and coffee; the English prefer to drink tea four or five times a day; the Australians prefer to drink a lot of beer; the French, like wine every day.\nPeople in different countries also like eating different kinds of meat and even within countries, different regions will have different likes and dislikes, especially in large countries like China and the former Soviet Union. In Hong Kong and the south of China, some people enjoy eating snakes but in the north of China, most people refuse to eat them. The French think that horse meat is delicious but most English people are terrified at the thought of eating it. The New Zealanders eat a lot of lamb and mutton, but never goat. The Japanese say that they do not like eating lamb and mutton because of their smell, but that they really enjoy eating raw fish more than anything else.\nSo it seems that there is often very little common sense about what is nicest to eat or drink in different parts of the world although we may talk on the subject of food for hours. However, as people everywhere enjoy eating what they have always eaten, there seems very little point in trying to change traditional eating habits.", "id": "high9649.txt"}
