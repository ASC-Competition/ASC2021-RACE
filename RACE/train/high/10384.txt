Everyone seemed to have had a good time. A few people had too good a time; they went home with designated   drivers. All evening, the gift table remained unguarded. Who would steal anything, Ray thought. He had never heard of such a thing happening at a wedding. But his best friend Aaron said there was a first time for everything. He walked out regularly from the inside festivities to check on the gift table, making sure no one doubtful was hanging around it.\nRay and Julia went on a 3-week honeymoon to Italy right after the wedding. When they got back, they opened all the gifts and sent out thank-you notes. But there was one problem. A married couple that used to be good friends had obviously given nothing. This surprised Julia, because Walt and Mary said they were excited to be invited. And, they actually seemed to have had a great time at the wedding. Frankly, Ray didn't even care if they hadn't given a gift. He just needed to know whether to send a thank-you note. Ray called Aaron. Aaron said maybe Walt had left an envelope on the gift table like Aaron had. \"Yes, but we got your envelope with the cash inside,\" Ray said.\n\"Maybe my envelope looked too thin, and some thief thought Walt's envelope looked nice and fat.\"\nAaron asked Ray if he had looked everywhere for Walt's gift. Had he called up the wedding site to see if anything had been left behind? Ray said that he had looked everywhere and made a lot of calls that were fruitless.\nRay didn't know what to do. If he sent Walt and Mary a thank-you note for a gift they hadn't given, they would be _ . If he didn't send them a thank-you note for a gift they had given, they would get angry.\n\"What would you do?\" Ray asked. Aaron said he would call Walt up and tell him the problem.\n\"You can't go wrong with simply being honest,\" Aaron said.\n\"Oh, yes, you can,\" Ray contradicted   him. \"Sometimes it's best to let sleeping dogs lie.\" But he thought about it, and finally decided that Aaron was right. He called Walt and told him the problem. Walt said that yes, he had given an envelope. In fact, the envelope contained $500 cash.\n\"$500?!\" Ray asked. \"That's a lot of cash, Walt!\" Walt admitted that it was, but he had gotten a fat raise early that year and Ray's was the only wedding he'd been to in quite a while. Ray thanked him very much, and apologized sincerely for someone stealing Walt's generous gift. Walt told him that it was \"only money\".\nWhen Ray told Aaron about Walt's gift, Aaron laughed. \"The only thief at the wedding was Walt! I stopped playing cards with him last year because I caught him cheating. And it was only a $10 pot! I'm sure I told you about that.\"\n\"Yes, you did tell me,\" Ray said. But, of course, he had to send Walt a thank-you note anyway.", "id": "high10384.txt"}
