The differences result from weather patterns. The chemical composition of rainfall changes slightly as rain clouds move.\nMost hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are stable, but traces of both elements are also present as heavier isotopes  . The heaviest rain falls first. As a result, storms that form over the Pacific deliver heavier water to California than to Utah.\nSimilar patterns exist throughout the U.S. By measuring the proportion of heavier hydrogen and oxygen isotopes along a strand of hair, scientists can construct a geographic timeline. Each inch of hair corresponds to about two months.\nCerling's team collected tap water samples from 600 cities and constructed a map of the regional differences. They checked the accuracy of the map by testing 200 hair samples collected from 65 barber shops. They were able to accurately place the hair samples in broad regions roughly corresponding to the movement of rain systems.\n\"It's not good for pinpointing ,\" Cerling said. \"It's good for eliminating many possibilities.\"\nTodd Park, a local detective, said the method has helped him learn more about an unidentified woman whose skeleton was found near Great Salt Lake.\nThe woman was 5 feet tall. Police recovered 26 bones, a T-shirt and several strands of hair.\nWhen Park heard about the research, he gave the hair samples to the researchers.\nChemical testing showed that over the two years before her death, she moved about every two months.\nShe stayed in the Northwest, although the test could not be more specific than somewhere between eastern Oregon and western Wyoming.\n\"It's still a substantial area,\" Park said \"But it narrows it way down for me.\"", "id": "high14060.txt"}
