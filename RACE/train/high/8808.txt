This cartoon showed President Teddy Roosevelt on a hunting trip refusing to shoot  a young bear. The young bear became a symbol for Teddy Roosevelt.\nMorris Michtom  owned a small candy and toy store in New York City. He and his wife made many of the toys they sold. When he saw the cartoon,he had a wonderful idea. He decided to make a toy bear with eyes and legs and arms that moved. The bear was put in the store window next to a copy of the cartoon. Mr . Michtom called it \"Teddy's Bear\".\nMany of these bears were sold. The bears became so popular that Mr . Michtom thought he might need President Roosevelt' permission to use his name. He wrote to the president and sent him a \"Teddy Bear\". The president answered,saying that Mr. Michtom could use his name.\nMr . Michtom borrowed money so that he could make thousands of toy bears. His company became the Ideal Toy Corporation. Today this is one of the biggest toy companies in the United States.", "id": "high8808.txt"}
