But he was probably better off than if they'd forced him to sit and stare into space until the end of time, conclude the authors of a new study on keeping busy. They found that people who have something to do, even something pointless, are happier than people who sit around.\n\"The general phenomenon I'm interested in is why people are too busy doing what they are doing in modern society,\" says Christopher K. Hsee, of the University of Chicago. \"People are running around, working hard, the way beyond the basic level.\" Sure, there are reasons, like making a living, earning money, and so on. But, Hsee says, \"I think there's something deeper: We have extra energy and we want to avoid idleness.\"\nIn a study 98 students were asked to complete two surveys. After they had completed the first they were made to wait 15 minutes to receive the next one. They were given a choice of either handing in the first survey nearby or at a more distant location they had to walk to. Whichever option they chose, they received a chocolate bar. Not everyone chose to go to the faraway location. Two-thirds chose the lazy option. Yet those who chose to stay busy by going to the faraway location were found to be happier than those who had _ .\nBut if the chocolate bars offered at the  two locations were different, they were more likely to choose the far location--because they could make up a good and acceptable reason for the trip, Hsee and his colleagues say.\nHsee thinks it may be possible to use this principle--people like being busy, and they like being able to show being busy right or reasonable--to benefit society. \"If we can find a way for idle people to engage in activity that is at least not harmful, I think it is better than destructive business,\" he says. Hsee himself has been known to  give a research assistant a useless task when he doesn't have anything to do, so he isn't sitting around the office getting bored and depressed.", "id": "high315.txt"}
