One lady told me she thought I was 12 and even told her 14-year-old daughter the same. I saw lots of surprised faces because people were told I was actually 19 years old.\nI'm actually 19 years old, which isn't much of a problem. I'm like the oldest of my friends and the shortest, which is pretty funny. That's probably one of the reasons I fit in so well with them.\nI volunteered at a weekend school teaching young children. Parents always looked me up and down like \"why is this 13-year-old girl teaching my child?!??!?\" I guessed it was because I'm also petite ,and I didn't know whether I had a childish face...??? Sometimes I found it funny, sometimes I found it annoying . But I just shrugged it off at last. You know, soon enough people got to know me and then realized I was not actually a 13-year-old girl.\nThis short thing used to be a problem for me, though. I was very very small when I was younger, so kids would  _ me. When I was 12, 8-year-old girls would look down at me like \"I CAN'TBELIEVEYOU'RETWELVE!\" I had always wanted to be tall. But now that I'm older, I got used to it, and I actually love it. You know, I'm fun sized!", "id": "high23331.txt"}
