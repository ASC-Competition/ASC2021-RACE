They accept bad services or products without making a sound. Why? Many feel complaining won't do any good. In fact, they're wrong, because companies don't want their customers unhappy. Not sure you can do it? Here are some ways to use when things go wrong.\n1.If you have a complaint, do something about it right away. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to get your complaint solved.\n2.First, complain to the servers. If they are not going to solve your problem, then ask politely to speak to a manager. And if that doesn't work, you can always request to speak to the manager's manager!\n3.Demand a discount . Let's say you were promised a hotel room with an ocean view, but got a view of a brick wall instead; if you were promised a seat in the front of a plane, but got a seat in the back. You should do something about both of these situations. Ask a special discount.\n4.Don't be passive. Offer ways you think the company can satisfy you.\n5.Insist on the price you were told. If you are refused, get a manager's name and telephone number, and promise to follow up with a letter and a telephone call.\n6.If all else fails, wait until you get home and take action. Call the company's head office, and speak to the most powerful person possible. Then follow up your call with a letter of complaint. If necessary, call the customer protection office in your city and complain.", "id": "high15882.txt"}
