The engineer doesn't say a word, but reaches into his wallet, pulls out a five dollar bill and hands it to the programmer.Now, it's the engineer's turn.He asks the programmer, \"What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down on four?\" The programmer looks up at him with a puzzled look.He takes out his laptop computer and searches all of his references.After about an hour, he wakes the engineer and hands him $50.The engineer politely takes the $50 and turns away to try to get back to sleep.The programmer, more than a little angry, shakes the engineer and asks, \"Well, so what's the answer?\" Without a word, the engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the programmer $5, and turns away and goes back to sleep.", "id": "high5387.txt"}
