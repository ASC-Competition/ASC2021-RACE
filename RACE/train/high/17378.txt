This helps us to adjust to the outside world. Without our nerves and our brain, which is a system of nerves, we couldn't know what's happening. But we pay for our sensitivity. We can feel pain when the slightest thing is wrong with any part of our body. The history of torture  is based on the human body being open to pain.\nBut there is a way to handle pain. Look at the Indian fakir  who sits on a bed of nails. Fakirs can put a needle right through an arm, and feel no pain. This ability that some humans have developed to handle pain should give us ideas about how the mind can deal with pain.\nThe big thing in withstanding pain is our attitude toward it. If the dentist says, \"This will hurt a little,\" it helps us to accept the pain. By staying relaxed, and by treating the pain as an interesting sensation  , we can handle the pain without falling apart. After all, although pain is an unpleasant sensation, it is still a sensation, and sensations are the stuff of life.", "id": "high17378.txt"}
