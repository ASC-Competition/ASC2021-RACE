As it conducted, it perfectly mimicked   the actions of a conductor,\nnodding its head at various sections and gesturing with one or both hands. ASIMO took a final bow to excited shouts from the audience. Later, cellist Yo-Yo Ma joined ASIMO onstage to receive an award for his efforts in music education.\nHonda spokeswoman Alicia Jones says it is the first time ASIMO has conducted an orchestra, and it may be the first time any robot has conducted a live performance. But ASIMO has its  limits. ASIMO's engineers programmed the robot to mimic Charles Burke, the Detroit Symphony's education director, as he conducted the piece in front of a pianist about six months ago. But it can't respond to the musicians.\n\"It's not a communicative device. It simply is programmed to do a set of gestures,\" said Leonard Slatkin, the orchestra's musical director. \"If the orchestra decides to go faster, there's nothing the robot can do about it. Hopefully, I keep that under control.\"\nBut several musicians also said ASIMO was more realistic than they expected. \"The movements are still a little stiff  , but very humanlike, much better than I thought,\" Hutchinson said.", "id": "high15476.txt"}
