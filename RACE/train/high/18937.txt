That's because Ashlyn, 13, can't feel pain. That might sound like a cool superpower. But without pain, everyday activities can be hazardous for Ashlyn. In fact, they could kill her.\nWhen Ashlyn was born, no one knew that she couldn't feel pain. But soon there was hints that something was wrong. When Ashlyn's teeth grew in, she almost chewed off part on her tongue. Ashlyn's parents took her to doctor for tests. The doctors discovered that Ashlyn couldn't feel pain, a condition called congenital insensitivity to pain(CIPA). Fewer than 100 people in the United States have it. There is no cure. .\n\"Sometimes it's frustrating,\" she admits.\nBut Ashlyn doesn't let anything stop her from doing things she wants to do. \"I just have to be careful,\" she says.\nFor years, Ashlyn didn't know anyone else who had CIPA. That made it harder to deal with her condition. \"I felt alone,\" she says.\nOne night she dreamed that there was a camp for kids like her. In 2011, Ashly's mom made the dream come true. She started Camp Painless But Hopeless.\nThe camp is for children who have CIPA. Every November, they and their families spend four days together.\nThe campers get to do daring activities like rock climbing--wearing safety equipment.\nSomeday, Ashlyn wants to be a director at the camp so she can help others who can't feel pain. In fact, Ashlyn is already helping others. Since 2004, she has let scientists study her to learn more about her condition. What they are finding out could one day help people who suffer from the same disease. That makes her feel great. \"I believe there is a reason for everything, \" she says, \"There is a reason for me.\"", "id": "high18937.txt"}
