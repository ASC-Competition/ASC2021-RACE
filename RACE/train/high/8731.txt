They look across your shoulder. There's no eye contact.\nMy name is Leslie. I am a real person. Up until two years ago, I was never looked in the eye by anyone.\nI was too tired to be a lover to my husband. I was falling asleep by 8 o'clock most evenings. When I did go out for an evening. my husband was ashamed of me. And he said so to my face. When I walked, my thighs scrape together. I couldn't even cross my legs. I was fat. Not just \"overweight\". Fat! I was 5'55\"tall and weighed 205 pounds.\nAbout 18 months ago, my husband Darrell left a \"Dear Leslie\"letter on my bed and asked for divorce.\nI went to a psychologist for advice. I knew that my weight was the source of my troubles. But I'd tried 14 different diets, at which I failed one by one.\nHe listened carefully and recommended an entirely different program. This was not a \"diet.\"It was a unique new weight-loss program researched by a team of specialists who help to treat the severely fat. I entered the program. Within the first four days, I lost only three pounds. So I was disappointed. But during the three weeks that followed, my weight began to drop from 205 pounds to 124 pounds. To me it was a miracle.\nThe reason why the program worked was simple. I was always eating. I could eat six times every day. I could snack in the afternoon. Snack before dinner. I could even have snack at night while watching TV.\nHow can you eat so much and still lose weight?\nThe secret is in the combination of foods, approved by the research team, which you eat in each 24 hour period. You will enjoy a variety of meats, chicken, fish, vegetables, potatoes, sauces. Even some light wine or beer if you wish. But be sure to have them in the right proportion , thus a complete 24-hour fat-reduction cycle is formed.\nWithout hunger, without nervousness, it lets you lose pounds so easily. Once you lose the weight, youll keep it off. Forever, I am sure of that.", "id": "high8731.txt"}
