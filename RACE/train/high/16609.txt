Because of the disease, Mattie had to get around in a wheelchair, but it did not stop him from staying positive and inspiring others with his message of peace. As a best-selling author and role model, Mattie provided a voice for people who suffer from muscular dystrophy. He spoke to people about the disease and about his dream for world peace. \n\"Mattie was something special, something very special,\" said Jerry Lewis, the chair of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, a group that works to find a solution to the disease. \"He was an example that made people want to reach for the best within themselves.\" \nMattie moved many people through his speeches and interviews, but he may have touched the most people through his poetry. During his life, Mattie wrote five books of poetry. Three of those books were The New York Times best-sellers. His books all had the word \"Heartsongs\" in the title. Mattie called his inner voice that encouraged him to work for peace his \"Heartsongs\". \nWhen his first book came out, just 200 copies were printed to be handed out to friends and supporters. But after the news of the book spread, 500,000 more copies were printed. People think Mattie's poems are very thoughtful. \nMattie first started writing poetry at the age of 3 to help him face the death of his brother, who also suffered from muscular dystrophy. \nThe magazine Time For Kids once interviewed Mattie. He told the reporter, \"Life is a gift. We have to make the best of it.\" Mattie said his task was to bring peace to the world.", "id": "high16609.txt"}
