With help from their parents, children can learn techniques  to improve their reading skills.\n\"A lot of parents think after their child learns to read, they should stop reading to them,\" Donna George said. \"They are sadly mistaken.\"\nGeorge offers her services to parents at the Title I Learning Centers. She said reading aloud to children may be the most valuable  thing parents can do. \"It is better for children to hear things at a higher level than where they are,\" George said. \"Parents are their child's first teacher.\" Parents help their children build listening, phonics , comprehension  and vocabulary skills when they read aloud to them.\nBefore parents can identify reading problems, they should escape the enemy----television and limit the time their children spend watching television. George suggested not allowing kids to have a TV in their bedrooms, setting a schedule of when kids can watch or keeping a list of how many programs children watch. Louise Joiners said while her 14-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son enjoy reading, the television sometimes becomes a _ . So she tries to build the situation by suggesting books the entire family will enjoy reading together, like the Harry Potter series.\nParents who do not read themselves should not depend on their children being enthusiastic about it. If parents would read to their children at least 15 minutes every day, children would not have so many problems in school. It is the parents' job to help build that desire in their children, and of course to know what kind of books to read is also important.", "id": "high6370.txt"}
