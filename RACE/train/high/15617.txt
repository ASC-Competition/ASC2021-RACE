Hundreds of junior soccer matches had to be abandoned last season because parent fans were swearing or even fighting on the touchline. At schools and clubs across the UK, hundreds of more matches also had to be called off for the same reason.\nReports tell of abuse at referees , players and coaches and fight breaking out on the touchline.\nEnough is enough    Peter Wright, a keen referee of junior soccer, finally hung up his boots last season. He decided to walk away for good. He said \"Every week I have had to take abuse and I've had enough of it.\"\n\"Parents' behaviour is reducing many school teachers, referees, coaches and volunteers to despair.\"\nThe kids are suffering    Jim Peter, a referee, said, \"We are getting desperate and the kids are suffering.\" He described the way spectators behave as\nand getting worse year by year. The big question is why so many parents shame their children in this way. Aggressive Behavior Contracts may have to be introduced to stop the violence and abuse. If not, the game will suffer.\nSign up to good conduct    Last season players and parents were made to sign a new good behavior contract. \"If a parent breaks the contract, I take his or her child off the pitch and get him or her to explain why I have done so to the child,\" said Marc Nash, Wallsend's assistant leader.\n\"The next step is to ban both the parent and the child, but happily, so far this has not been necessary.\"", "id": "high15617.txt"}
