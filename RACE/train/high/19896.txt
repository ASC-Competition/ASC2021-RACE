They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment  is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China.\nTo find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse.\nThey believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation.\nProfessor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000 were mature students, often funded by the government, since 2004, however, they have been younger, most funded by their families.\nMaybe UK institutions need to work harder to take into account what a big challenge it is for young people from a radically different culture and linguistic background to adapt to life in the UK. \"We need to do more, contacting students before their arrival, assigning them tutors, encouraging peer-assisted learning, for example,\" says Sedghi.", "id": "high19896.txt"}
