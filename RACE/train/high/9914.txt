The boss is impressed.We have completely embraced paper technology.Now that we all use pencils, doodling is on the increase, and the quality of pencil woman ship is impressive, as you can tell from my handwriting in this letter.By the way, if you can, please send this letter back to us.We can erase and reuse it.Just tie it to Maggie's leg and she'll know where to take it.\nNow it's very calm and quiet here.You can notice the difference.No more loud chatter on the telephones! All we hear is the scratching of pencil on paper, the sound of pigeons, and the delivery of inter-office correspondence by paper airplane.\nWonderful! I've always wanted to work for an insurance company ever since I was a little girl.Now it's perfect.\nSincerely yours,\nEleanor Lightly\nSpokeswoman and Company Hair Stylist\nABC Activity Insurance: insure against overdoing it", "id": "high9914.txt"}
