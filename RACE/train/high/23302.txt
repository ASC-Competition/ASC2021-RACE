Instead, what has sparked concern is the worsening health of coral reefs, which more than one million aquatic species including the clownfish depend on to thrive, even survive. \nIn ways it makes more sense to move to protect a species when its habitat declines rather than its actual population. The most important mission of the Endangered Species Act is the protection of species' habitats; without their habitats, there's almost no hope of saving endangered animals, except perhaps in a zoo.\n   Earlier this year, alarming news came about the world's largest coral reef system, Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR,). A study has shown the Reef is in sharp decline, with half of its coral cover gone in the past 27 years. \n    Katharina Fabricius, an Australian coral reef ecologist co-authoring the study, has been diving and working on the GBR since 1988--and has watched the decline. \"There are still a lot of fish ... but not the same color1 and diversity as in the past,\" she said.\n   The study team used information from more than 2,000 surveys to determine the rate of decline between 1985 and 2012. That overall 50-percent decline, they estimate, is a yearly loss of about 3.4 percent of the Reef. If the trend continued, the coral cover could halve again by 2022. \n   Several main factors are responsible for the decline, the study found. Intense tropical cyclones  , believed to be fueled by global warming, have caused massive damage to reefs in the central and southern parts of the Reef. Meanwhile, population explosions of the coral-consuming crown-of-thorns starfish   have affected coral populations along the length of the Reef. Two severe coral bleaching   events, caused by ocean warming, have also had major damaging impacts in northern and central parts of the GBR.", "id": "high23302.txt"}
