Although our \"act\" would last only for a short time, we could see quite a number of interesting things.\nWe all stood at the far end of the studio as workmen prepared the scene, setting up trees at the edge of a winding path. Very soon, bright lights were turned on and the big movie-camera was wheeled into position. The director shouted something to the camera operator and then went to speak to the two famous actors nearby. Since it was hot in the studio, it came as a surprise to us to see one of the actors put on a heavy overcoat and start walking along the path. A big fan began blowing tiny white feathers down on him, and soon the trees were covered in \"snow\". Two more fans were turned on, and a \"strong wind\" blew through the trees. The picture looked so real that it made us feel cold.\nThe next scene was a complete contrast  . The way it was filmed was quite unusual. Pictures in front taken on an island in the Pacific were shown on a glass screen  . An actor and actress stood of the scene so that they looked as if they were at the water's edge on an island. By a simple trick like this, palm trees, sandy beaches, and blue, clear skies had been brought into the studio!\nSince it was our turn next, we were left wondering what scene would be prepared for us. For a full three minutes in our lives we would be experiencing the excitement of being film \"stars\"!", "id": "high386.txt"}
