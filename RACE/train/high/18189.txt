Nobody out here was looking at it and I just had to share it with someone.\"\n       For a few seconds we just looked.Then I said, \"God is in his heaven and all is right with the world.\" I thanked her for coming out to see it; she went back inside and I left.It felt good to share the beauty.\n       Four years later my situation changed greatly.I came to the end of a twenty-year marriage.I was alone and on my own for the first time in my life.I lived in a trailer park which, at the time, I considered a real come-down, and I had to do my wash in the community laundry room.\n       One day, while my clothes were going around, I picked up a magazine and read an article about a woman who had been in similar circumstances.She had come to the end of a marriage, moved to a strange community, and the only job she could find was one she disliked: clothing sales in a department store.\n       Then something that happened to her changed everything.She said a woman came into her department store and asked her to step outside to look at a sunset.The stranger had said, \"God is in his heaven and all is right with the world,\" and she had realized the truth in that statement.From that moment on, she turned her life around.", "id": "high18189.txt"}
