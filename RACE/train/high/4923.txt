What he could do was just stay in his wheelchair all day long. At first, Jason stayed with him for a few days. But days later, Jason felt very discouraged and embarrassed to spend time staying with a disabled man like Sam. So he went to see Sam less and less. He made new friends.

You are always my best friend ... ... Sam\". When he finished reading the letter Mr Lee said, \"I have promised that I will keep this a secret until Sam is gone. Now you know it.\" Jason stood there.
