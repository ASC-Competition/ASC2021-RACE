After a few minutes he spoke. \"That's a pretty car,\" he said, pointing to my car. He was ragged  , but he had an air of dignity about himself.\nI gave him a smile and continued cleaning my car.\nHe sat there quietly as I worked. The expected asking for money never came. As the silence between us widened, it seemed that a voice inside me said, \"Ask him if he needs any help.\" I was sure that he would say \"yes\", but I listened to the inner voice.\n\"Do you need any help?\" I asked.\nHe answered in three simple but meaningful words that I shall never forget. We often look for wisdom in great men and women, and we expect it from those of higher learning and achievements. I expected nothing but a dirty hand from him, but he said three words that shook me.\n\"Don't we all?\" he said.\nI was feeling high, successful and important above a beggar in the street, until those three words hit me like a shot.\nDon't we all?\nI needed help. Maybe not for a bus fare or for a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only for a bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day. Those three little words still ring true. No matter how much you have, no matter how much you have achieved, you need help, too. No matter how little you have, no matter how loaded you are with problems, even without money or a place to sleep, you can give help.", "id": "high20463.txt"}
