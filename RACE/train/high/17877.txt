We've really had just about enough of you.Although we have tried to speak to you civilly on several occasions,you have always responded with a stream of verbal abuse  .\n     Ever since you moved in three months ago,you have shown very little consideration for the other residents of the building,despite numerous complaints.For the past six weekends in a row, you have held extremely noisy parties,which have not finished until the early hours of the morning.It's just not on! As you are aware,most of the people here are old people or have very young children,and the noise keeps them awake all night.You don't have to be so noisy,do you?\nLast weekend the situation  _ further when two of your acquaintances were involved in a fight on the first floor landing.The disturbance was so bad that the police had to be called.What's more,your mates left the stairs in a terrible state--they even broke two windows on their way out! We feel that this type of bad behaviour is unbearable.\nWe strongly recommended that you arrange payment for this damage to the windows,soon.If you don't and you carry on being a nuisance  ,we will kick you out! Legal steps will be taken if necessary.\n                                                                                   Yours sincerely", "id": "high17877.txt"}
