The loss of financial aid or an unexpected change in the financial condition of their source of support.Students must also meet other conditions.They must have attended their American school for at least one year.Government approval is given on a case-by-case basis.Students must re-apply after a year if they want to continue all off-campus job.\nForeign students who will be attending graduate school can apply for some jobs before they come to the United States.A good example is a university job like a teaching or research assistantship.Some schools pay their assistants.Others provide free education in return.\nMany do both.Graduate assistants might teach, give tests,grade work, assist professors with research and hold office hours.Many universities now provide language training to foreign teaching assistants to help them improve their English.Some schools require foreign students to pass an English speaking test before they arc permitted to teach.\nInternational student offices at schools have to provide information on students each term to the Department of Homeland Security.Students who violate the terms of their visa--for example,\nBy working off-campus without permission--could be sent home.", "id": "high23266.txt"}
