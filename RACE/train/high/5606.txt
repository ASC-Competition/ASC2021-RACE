Every day is a new day and a fresh start to learn, grow, develop your strengths, free yourself from past regrets or hurts, and move forward older and wiser. Every day gives you a chance to reinvent   yourself. It is never too late to change things that are not working in your life.\nEach day is a new beginning and a piece of blank paper. How would you like to create your day? What would you like to paint on it? If you wake up in a negative mind, you are more likely to paint a dark picture throughout the day, and your picture will not show hope, happiness and joy.\nIf you take each day to think actively, and have a positive intention  for how you would like to create your day, how would your life be different? What can daily positive intentions do for you? Every day you will give yourself the gift of an \"attitude of gratitude \".\nEach day is a chance to look at things in a different way.
