No one died and no one was sick. We were all living a happy life until my grandfather had cancer. No matter how much I told myself he might not die, somehow I still felt as if it was a death sentence. He fought so hard but died at 63. I honestly didn't know how I dealt with. I never cried alone. I had the support of my family and teachers. I just remembered my grandfather's wish that we should celebrate his life. \nThat's how we came up with the idea for Hives   for Lives -- a business my sister and I started where all the profits   go to the American Cancer Society (ACS). During our first year we donated   more than $2,000 to the ACS. The next year a man who belonged to my grandparents' \"bee club\" gave his honey to us, and our little business grew. We sold at wine festivals, schools, and to anyone else who would buy! We had my uncle sell in California and my grandmother sell in Chicago. We have sold honey in 13 states -- even in Puerto Rico! This year we donated more than $10,000 to the ACS and we're hoping to do more next year. Hopefully our business will help research into the causes of cancer or just improve the life of someone with cancer.\nI feel like Hives for Lives is a way to honor my grandfather. Honor his love, his life, and his strength. With Hives for Lives reminding me of my grandfather every day, I feel as if I can move on in life, that he will always be alive in my heart and memories. It made me deal with his death, because I felt like I had truly honored his wish of celebrating his life.", "id": "high23476.txt"}
