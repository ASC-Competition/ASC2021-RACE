They can transform a normal-looking actor into a cowboy, a space alien or even a superhero. Costumes for movies are designed and created by a whole team of people, according to Courtney Daniel, a Toronto-based costume designer who worked on the recent movie Night At The Museum.\nAs a designer, she does research to find out what details are needed to make a costume work, and what makes sense for a specific movie. In Night At The Museum, she and a few other designers spent time at libraries and museums studying everything from what cowboys should wear, to what ancient Egyptians and Huns would have put on. Once they got the information they needed, they figured out what fabrics   to use and how to put them together.\nThe designers even changed a few details to make the costumes more \"movie friendly\". For example, more colour and extra touches  helped historical costumes to be alive for kids. One example of this is the costume for the role in the movie Night At The Museum, an Indian woman Sacagawea, which has a shorter skirt and fits more closely than the clothes the real Sacagawea would have worn.\nDaniel has also worked on costumes for other big-name movies, such as the second and third X-Men movies, and Catwoman. If you are. interested in being a costume designer, it helps to have an interest in sewing. She said,\"Learning how to sew, and how different fabrics and materials work is important.\"So is knowing how to carry out research, Daniel's degree in art history helped in this area.", "id": "high21399.txt"}
