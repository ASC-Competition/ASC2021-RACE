One of the top choices was investment banking. Lots of people see banking as a way to move up the social ladder and make a lot of money. But it is important to remember that money can't buy happiness. \nJust ask Greg Smith. The former executive director of the top US investment banking firm, Goldman Sachs, resigned his job last week. On the day he quit, he wrote an article in the New York Times describing the \"toxic\" culture of the company for which he had worked for 12 years.\nSmith revealed that over the years, Goldman Sachs often took advantages of its clients. The company tried to make as much money as possible for the firm instead of working for the best deals for their investors.\n\"The firm has turned so far from the place I joined right out of college that I can no long in good conscience say that I identify with what it stands for,\" Smith wrote. \"It makes me ill how coldly people talk about ripping their clients off.\nSmith also criticized the company's promotion policy.

The way you treat your clients and colleagues does not matter.\n\"Goldman Sachs today has become too much about shortcuts and not enough about achievements. It just doesn't feel right to me anymore.\" Smith wrote.\nThe rewards are great for those who succeed in investment banking. But perhaps it is worth   thinking about how your career will affect your character and how others see you. If Smith is right, success in this career requires a high level of dishonesty.\nThose hoping to make a career in investment banking might want to think twice about the culture of the finance field.
