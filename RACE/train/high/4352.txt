It starts on Great Western Road, winding its way along Chepstow Road, then on to Westbourne Grove, and then down Ladbroke Grove. See our Notting Hill Carnival map for the full route.\nBus\nWhile extra services will be in operation, no buses will enter the Carnival area from first thing Sunday morning until the first service on Tuesday morning. On both days bus services begin from Notting Hill Gate in the south and from Harrow Rd (close to Elgin Avenue) in the north.\nBike\nLast year the nearest bike-parking stations - Chepstow Villas and Pembridge Road - were removed for Carnival, so don't rely on being able to park your bike nearby this year.\nSafety\nAvoid carrying expensive items, such as jewellery and digital cameras. Take a bag with a secure zip to keep your more valuable possessions in and avoid putting your valuables in your back pocket.\nDo tell police if you see an incident. Officers will be stationed throughout the Carnival area. Don't try to walk against the flow of the crowd, as you won't get far. Drink plenty of water on the day too, especially if the sun makes an appearance.\nChildren\nChildren's Day on Sunday is recommended for families as the smaller crowds and kid-friendly floats  create a fun atmosphere. Arrange meeting points in case you become separated. The smaller the buggy , the better. Ear defenders may be necessary for very young children.", "id": "high4352.txt"}
