Graduating from a top university might not be enough. A new study from the University of Essex in Britain has shown that the more friends you have in school, the more money you'll earn later.\nThe idea that popularity could have a serious impact on one's earning potential shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The researchers noted that if you want to get ahead in life, social skills and networking are easily as powerful as talent and hard work.\n\"If a person has lots of friends, it means that he or she has the ability to get along with others in all kinds of different situations,\" said Xu Yanchun, 17, from Nantou High School in Shenzhen, who totally agreed with the recent finding. \"Also, friends always help each other.
