One day he decided to get the sweetest mango from the very top of the tree. Mangoes which are exposed to the sun the most are the sweetest.\nSo he climbed up to the top, where the branches were thin. He managed to pick up a few sweet reddish fruits, but, in an attempt to climb down, he slipped and started falling towards the ground. Fortunately, he caught the branch as he was falling and remained helplessly hanging on the tree. Then he started to call nearby villagers for help. They immediately came with a ladder and sticks, but could do little to help him.\nThen after some time one calm and thoughtful person arrived - a well-known sage who lived in a simple hut nearby. People were very curious to see what he would do, as he was famous in solving many people's problems in the area and sometimes very complicated ones.\nHe was silent for a minute and then picked up a stone and threw it at the hanging man.\nEverybody was surprised. The hanging mango lover started to shout: What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Do you want me to break my neck?\"  The sage was silent. Then he took another stone and threw it at the man. The man was very angry: \"If I could just come down, I would show you!\"\nThat's what everybody wanted - that he came down. But how? Now everybody was tense, as to what would happen next! Some wanted to chastise the sage, but they didn't. The sage picked another stone and threw it again at the man, even more forcefully. Now the man on the tree was enraged and developed a great determination to come down and take revenge. \nHe then used all his skill and strength and somehow reached the branches which were safe to start going down. And he made it! Everybody was amazed.\nHowever, the rescued man found the sage gone. He stood there, realizing that the man really sed him because he induced him to try his best and save himself.\n\"I should be thankful and not angry.\"", "id": "high2627.txt"}
