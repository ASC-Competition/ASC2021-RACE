The black-framed glasses are compatible   with recent Android operating systems. Last month Google announced that it was withdrawing its smart glasses for redevelopment. Sony's initial model will come with a software development kit to encourage people to design apps for it, the company said.\nThe glasses, which weigh 77g, contain an accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, image and brightness sensors, 3-megapixel camera and a microphone. They also come with a controller, designed to be attached to clothing, which contains a speaker, touch sensor and the device's battery.

I can't see how something thick-rimmed and more invasive-looking than Google Glass is going to catch on.\n\"People are keen on wearables like fitness bands and watches, but they care about their faces. Wearing something on your head is a lot stronger than wearing something on your arm,\" he added. \"The industry keeps pushing it but consumers just don't want it.\"", "id": "high9160.txt"}
