Now Jennifer Fitzgerald, 31, is stuck with the bill but says the 1999 Chevy Monte Carlo actually belongs to an ex-boyfriend who registered the car in her name without informing her. \nThe Expired Meter reports that from May 23, 2009 to April 30, 2012, the Chicago Department of Finance (DOF) issued 678 tickets against the car, totaling $105,761.80. It set a Chicago record both for the total number and amount of parking fines issued. In fact, it blew past the previous record holder, which was $65,000 from about 400 tickets. \nBut Fitzgerald says she doesn't owe the city a dime and has filed a lawsuit   in Cook County Circuit Court against the city of Chicago, United Airlines and the ex-boyfriend. Fitzgerald has two main arguments in her case. First, she says her ex-boyfriend, Brandon Preveau, is the actual owner of the car, having purchased it from her uncle for $600 in 2008. In fact, Preveau paid for the car's title, registration and insurance, but it was registered in Fitzgerald's name. \"Brandon used his income tax refund to pay Patrick $600 for the automobile,\" reads Fitzgerald's complaint. \"For some reasons not recalled by Patrick, however, Patrick signed the title to the car over to Jennifer.\"\nSecond, Fitzgerald's lawyer is arguing that the city should have simply towed the vehicle after 30 days from O'Hare Airport, where it was parked and where Preveau worked at the time. According to Fitzgerald's complaint, on or before November 17, 2009, Brandon drove the car into the parking lot and never drove it out again. And as the Expired Meter reports, Chicago law does specify that an abandoned vehicle is to be towed 30 days after being illegally parked.", "id": "high23708.txt"}
