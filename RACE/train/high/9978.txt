Alexander, after conquering many kingdoms, was returning home. On the way, he fell ill and it took him to his death bed. With death staring him in his face, Alexander realized how his conquests, his great army, his sharp sword and all his wealth were of no consequence. So, he lay helplessly waiting to breathe his last. He called his generals and said, \"I will depart from this world soon, I have three wishes, please carry them out without fail.\"\n\"My first desire is that,\" said Alexander, \"My physicians alone must carry my coffin.\" After a pause, he continued, \"Secondly, I desire that when my coffin is being carried to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard be strewn  with gold, silver and precious stones which I have collected.\" The king continued, \"My third and last wish is that both my hands be kept hanging out of my coffin.\" Alexander's favorite general kissed his hand and pressed them to his heart. \"Oh King, we assure you that your wishes will all be fulfilled. But tell us why do you make such strange wishes?\"\nAt this Alexander took a deep breath and said, \"I would like the world to know of the three lessons I have just learnt. I want my physicians to carry my coffin because people should realize that no doctor can really cure any body. They are powerless and cannot save a person from the _ of death. So let people not take life for granted.\nThe second wish of strewing gold, silver and other riches on the way to the graveyard is to tell people that not even a bit of gold will come with me. I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people realize that it is just a waste of time to chase wealth.\nAnd about my third wish of having my hands hanging out of the coffin, I wish people to know that I came empty-handed into this world and empty-handed I go out of this world.\" With these words, the king closed his eyes. Soon he let death conquer him and breathed his last.", "id": "high9978.txt"}
