Then, it was like a counting house with his copyists on high stools, transcribing the works and their illustrative contexts, which he had underlined in his wide range of reading.\nHe had six assistants and finished his task in eight years. The editor of the Oxford dictionary had 25 lexicographers to assist him and, although the first volume was published in 1884, the last supplement would not be ready until next year-101 years later. The present editor, Robert Burchfield, had put 28 years into it.\nYet Johnson's dictionary was still being used until the Oxford dictionary replaced it, and it was regularly reprinted long after his death in 1784. It was written, he said, to refine the English language,\"to clear it from colloquial barbarisms and licentious idioms.\"\nIt certainly bore the stamp of one man's personality. Many of his definitions show his sense of humor. \"Novel\", for instance, is defined as \"a small tale, generally of love\", and\"dull\" is illustrated by the sentence:\"To make dictionaries is a dull work.\"", "id": "high22910.txt"}
