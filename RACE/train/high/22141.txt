They are seen as the uniform of the high-flying career businesswoman, but it seems trouser suits are not the best way to make a good first impression .\nResearch has shown women who wear skirts and jackets are considered as more confident, higher-earning and easier to adjust to society than those wearing a trouser suit.\nScientists also found that opinions of others, based just on the clothes they are  wearing, are formed within seconds of first meeting.  So while trouser suits are linked  with strong will and success, a skirt suit gives a better first impression.Professor Karen Pine, who co-led the research at the department of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, said,  \"We make very rapid judgments about people within the first few seconds of meeting based on their clothing. \"\n\"It was surprising that studies have suggested that women who dress in a more mannish style were seen as having greater professional status .The skirt suit seems to balance professionalism with attractiveness,\" added Pine.\nResearchers showed 306 volunteers a series of pictures of a man or a woman wearing suits before asking them to rate them on a number of personality traits . The facial features of the man and woman in the pictures had been covered so the volunteers were only making judgments about what they were wearing.\nThe woman was rated more confident and: having a higher salary and easy to adjust to society when she was wearing skirt suits.", "id": "high22141.txt"}
