Do you have a problem reaching here ?\"\nWe reacted with blank stares.\n\"No, you don' t !\"he said , answering his own question.\"You have a staircase to help you climb up to this level.No one expects you to make it in two giant leaps.You simply take one step at a time.Any task can be solved if you focus on the immediate action to be taken.The rest w ill take care of itself, if you keep at it.One step at a time.That' s the secret.\"\nThen he wrote down an o ld motto on the blackboard --the longest journey starts with a single step.Having heard his staircase analogy , w e understood why he asked us the question and we saw him in a new light.\nMost of my classmates scored distinctions in maths.And I went on to become an English teacher.To this day , whenever I pass on Mr.Iyer's invaluable advice to my own students , they brighten up at the prospect of a lighter academic burden.", "id": "high18770.txt"}
