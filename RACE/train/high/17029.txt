In actual fact, people often behave more strangely in real life than they do in stories. \nThe following advertisement once appeared in a local newspaper: \"An opportunity to earn $ 250 in a few minutes. A man... willing to chances, wanted for an out-of-the-ordinary job which can be performed only once. \"A reader found this offer very nice and write to the advertiser. But being a bit suspicious , he gave a false name. Soon afterwards, he received a reply. Enclosed in the envelope was a typed note instructing him to ring a certain number if he was still interested. He did so and learned on the telephone that the advertiser wanted him \"to get rid of somebody\" and would discuss it more fully with him the next day. But the man told the police and from then on acted under their instructions. \nThe police saw the two men meet and watched them as they drove away together. In the car the advertiser came to the point at once; he told the man he wanted him to shoot his wife. The reason he gave was that he was suffering from a serious disease and wanted to live in a warmer country, but his wife objected to this. Giving the man some money, the advertiser told him to buy a gun and warned him to be careful of the dog, though it would not bite, it might attract attention. He also gave him a photograph of his wife so that he would be able to recognize her. \nAfter that, the advertiser suggested that the man should \"do the job\" the next morning. At the same time he would prepare his wife by telling her that a young man was going to call. After the murder they would meet again outside a railway station and the money would be paid as arranged. The second meeting never took place, for the advertiser was arrested shortly afterwards and charged with attempting to persuade someone to murder his wife.", "id": "high17029.txt"}
