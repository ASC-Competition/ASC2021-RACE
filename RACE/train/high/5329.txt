Another way is to offer \"free trials\" and then hit customers with bills. This brings us to PDC Education Ltd, run by Rebecca Jordan and Kirsty Weir of Leeds, whose website teaching-resources-uk.com offers teaching plans for teachers.\nRosemarie Brady, finance manager of Rutlish School in Merton, southwest London, tells us that one teacher called Amanda Seyfried downloaded the \"free\" resources. \"Unfortunately in very small print, they state that unless the free trial is cancelled, then you will be charged,\" she says.\nA year has gone by and now they've been sent a second bill for 500 pounds, just because they forgot to cancel the \"free trial\".\nMerton Council--and it's not the only one--has sent a warning to all its schools saying: \" Only in the very (easily missed) small print of the terms and conditions is it explained that, after the 14-day trial, schools will be automatically signed for a two-year contact with the company.\"\n\"This will only be stopped if the teacher who requested the trial writes directly to PDC to cancel before the 14 days have expired . The fee can be as much as hundreds of pounds, with the threat of debt recovery if they are not paid.\"\nAmong the online complaints is this one from a teacher. \"How disappointed I am that they will not even consider seriously re-negotiating the invoice .\"\nRebecca Jordan of PDC Education said, \" The whole purpose behind the free trial is that we have confidence in our business. This free trial period gives teachers the chance to see what is on offer without having to commit to a payment.\"\nOnly a \"very small number\" of teachers have complained when they receive an invoice, she added. \" Their only complaint is that they have not checked what they are signing up to but that is not our fault, the position is totally clear. The prices and the trial terms are clear to see on the online sign up page.\"\nIt's true the terms and conditions are on their website. But perhaps it's unhelpful that they run to almost 3000 words.", "id": "high5329.txt"}
