In deciding which candidateIwant to vote for, there are two main issues for me:the economy and education. \nThese issues are important to me because they affect me the most right now. The economy affects everyone,and education is important because I am about to enter college. When I looked at how each candidate views these issues, one man stood out to me,and that is Democratic candidate Barack Obama. \nI like a11 of Senator Obama's ideas for improving the economy. He wants to bring the troops home from Iraq,thereby saving the $12 billion we spend there every month. Another point that Obama makes is that the United States' current energy policy is hurting the economy. He believes that if new energy bills are passed, it will help the U. S. get out of its current economic slump,and I agree. With these ideas and strategies, I strongly believe that Obama can improve the current state of the economy. \nObama also has a plan to improve education. He believes that we need to start educating children at a young age. He also hopes to close the gap of achievement between students, which means improving schools that need help. He wants to pay teachers more and treat them like professionals,but in exchange he calls for higher responsibility. \nObama also has a plan to make college more affordable. He wants public colleges to be free for students who maintain a \"B\" average during high school. And he plans to give a $4,000 tax credit for college and university students who complete 100 hours of community service each year. I believe these ideas to improve education are good enough and will help many students. \nTherefore, there is no longer any doubt in my mind who will be receiving my vote: Barack Obama.", "id": "high20134.txt"}
