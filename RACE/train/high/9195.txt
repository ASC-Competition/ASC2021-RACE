It began to develop in the mid-1960s in Britain and the US, when rock bands such as the Rolling Stones experimented with music from older African-American blues musicians.

Derived from folk rock, it uses acoustic instruments and puts more emphasis on melody and harmony.\nAlthough the genre gets quite a bad name among hardcore rock fans, who see it as \"wimpy\" , it doesn't mean soft rock is without merit  . Soft rock songs often deal with themes like romantic relationships and everyday life in a thoughtful and complex way hard rock simply couldn't.", "id": "high9195.txt"}
