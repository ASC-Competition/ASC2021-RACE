Any changes such as the dog being walked less often, perhaps not being fed regularly, or simply demonstrating \"unhappy\" behaviour could be an early indicator for families that an older relative needs help. This is the first system of its kind which allows us to remotely monitor a dog's behaviour in its natural setting.\"\nThe team of academics, who presented their findings at the 2013 UbiComp conference in Zurich, created a hi-tech, waterproof   dog collar for the study.\nDr Cas Ladha, who led the study, said: \"A lot of our research is focused on developing intelligent systems that can help older people to live independently for longer. But developing a system that _ family and carers that an older relative is well without intruding on   the individual's privacy is difficult. This is just the first step but the idea behind this research is that it would allow us to support people without the need for cameras.\"\nA range of dogs was used for the study, as the team needed to map distinct behaviours that correlated between different breeds.", "id": "high7180.txt"}
