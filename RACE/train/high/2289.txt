However, she doesn't think that puts any pressure on their relationship.\nHer work isn't physically very hard, but it's not exactly pleasant, either. \"I do get angry with people who leave their offices like a place for raising pigs. If they realized people like me have to do it, perhaps they'd be a bit more careful.\"\nThe fact that she's working all night doesn't worry Margaret at all. Unlike some dark buildings at night, the building where she works is fully lit, and the women work in groups of three. \"Since I've got to be here, I try to enjoy myself----and I usually do, because of the other girls. We all have a good laugh, so the time never drags.\"\nAnother challenge Margaret has to face is the reaction of other people when she tells them what she does for a living. \"They think you're a cleaner because you don't know how to read and write,\" said Margaret. \"I used to think _ but I don't think that way any more. I don't dislike the work though I can't say I'm mad about it.\"", "id": "high2289.txt"}
