E Australia , measures an amazing 20.1 hands , or 2.057m tall . He weighs over 1.3 tons ( 1,300kg) -- about the same as a small car -- and is still growing . His owner , horse trainer Jane Greenman , 47 , says the only time the horse runs is when there is food on offer . \" He eats an unbelievable amount . I would hate to run a team of eight horses his size--it would send you broke . \" she says .\nThe massive horse , whose name is Noddy , was born in Australia with its parents imported from England . Noddy's grandfather , Ladbrooke Edward (UK) was the world's tallest horse during the 1980's .But Jane had no idea that the horse she raised from the age of six months would grow this big . Noddy immediately began to rocket and soon overtook both his parents in size .\nAlthough she says that she is not interested in the Guiness Book of World Records , nevertheless Jane has carried out her own research and is sure that Noddy comes top . \" The nearest is a horse in Texas , at 20 hands ,\" says Jane . \" Noddy is already an inch taller than that . The frightening thing is he still hasn't finished--shire horses aren't fully grown until they're about six or seven .\"\nJane has said that Noddy could be sold overseas , possibly even fetching a record price to match his height . She is unwilling to sell , but to fund the high cost of keeping him she needs to put him to work . \" He needs a job . It's very hard to find jobs for such a big horse in Australia . I wish he could stay here but I've tried everywhere , \" she says regretfully . \" I just want people to enjoy this beautiful animal as much as I do .\"", "id": "high16414.txt"}
