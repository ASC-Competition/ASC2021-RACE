And they may be right.\nA Swedish study published in the journal Traffic Injury Prevention concludes that digital billboards hold the gazes of drivers longer than two seconds. Previous studies have shown that anything that takes a driver's eyes off the road for that length of time increases the risks of a crash. \"This study proves what is common sense when it comes to digital billboards,\" says Mary Tracy, president of Scenic America, a national nonprofit group that seeks to limit billboards. \"Bright, constantly changing signs on the sides of roads are meant to attract and keep the attention of drivers, and this study confirms that this is exactly what they do.\"\nThe Federal Highway Administration allowed digital signs for the first time in 2007 after concluding they did not pose a significant danger. But a follow-up report is pending   and could be released this year. California has no law banning the billboards, and is one of 39 states that allows them. \"We would need to review more research, so it's too early to call for a ban,\" says Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. \"There is a role for digital messaging, such as conveying urgent information and other safety messages.\"\nThere are more than 1,800 digital billboards nationwide, more than double the number five years ago. While no data indicate an increase in accidents due to the Bay Area signs, many drivers are opposed to them.\n\"Monstrosities\" is what Merlin Dorfman of San Jose calls them, while insurance agent David Whitlock says he has found them a major distraction. \"They're much too bright at night,\" he says. \"When the advertisement switches from a bright color to a darker one, your eyes cannot adjust fast enough, and you end up losing sight of the roadway.\"\nOfficials with sign companies could not be reached for comment, but Bryan Parker, an executive vice president for Clear Channel Outdoor, told USA Today last year that \"there's no doubt in my mind that they are not a driving distraction.\"", "id": "high4563.txt"}
