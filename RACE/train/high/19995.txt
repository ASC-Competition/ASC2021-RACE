Sounds all around you! You can hear the sound of traffic, the wind in the trees, a dog barking, your own breathing and lots of other things.\nBut what is sound? Sound happens when something vibrates or shakes. We can make something vibrate by hitting it. Try this experiment. Put your ruler on your desk so that part of it sticks out over the edge . Put your hand on the part of the ruler that is on the desk. Now pull the part that is sticking out over the edge down, and then let it go. The part you let go will vibrate. It will move up and down very quickly, and give out sound.\nThe part of the ruler sticking out over the edge of the desk produced the sound. If you make that part longer, you will hear a lower sound. When you shorten it, you will hear a higher sound. Why does this happen?\nWhen you shorten the ruler, it will vibrate more quickly. When something vibrates more quickly it produces a higher sound. If you  _ the ruler, it will vibrate more slowly. When something vibrates more slowly, it produces a lower sound.", "id": "high19995.txt"}
