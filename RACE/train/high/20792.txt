She had always been in good shape during high school, but now, in her first year of college, she was suddenly ten pounds heavier. \"My friends and I often had pizza or ice cream when we studied late at night,\" she said, \"and I was always drinking Coke to stay awake.\"\nCelia's experience is common. Many students enter college and find it so different that they cannot deal with changes properly. They're away from their parents and in a new stressful environment. Pressures together with freedom to sleep and eat however they please cause many students to experience the \"Freshman 15\": gaining weight suddenly in their freshman year of college.\nMost students do not realize that the \"Freshman 15\" can cause some serious health problems. Of course, college-age adults are still developing bone mass, so gaining some weight is normal. Sudden weight gain, however, puts too much strain on the heart and lungs, resulting in little energy and some difficulty thinking and remembering. In later life, it can lead to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and possibly cancer.\nThe solution to the \"Freshman 15\" is simple--pay attention to developing good habits! In general:\n* Eat normal-sized meals at regular times. Eat slowly and enjoy it, so you don't need to go back for more.\n* Keep only healthy snacks in your room--and don't snack too often!\n* Control drinking and smoking. Alcohol has a lot of calories, and smoking too much makes exercise difficult.\n* Exercise regularly! Even just 30 minutes a day--such as walking quickly to class from your dorm--will make a big difference!", "id": "high20792.txt"}
