But man has nothing but a thin skin.\nIf someone were to ask you, \"Why did human beings start to cover their bodies with clothes?\" most would answer, \"To keep themselves warm, of course.\"\nIt is only when we begin to think about it a little that we realize that clothes are worn for a great many reasons that have nothing to do with our need for warmth at all.\nFor example, we wear clothes to some degree in order to decorate ourselves -- to make ourselves, if possible, look more dignified   or nicer.\nClothes of a special kind are often worn to show that the wearer has authority or power. The individual wearing them is treated with respect because he occupies a certain office. The judge on the Bench, for example, might look a very ordinary and unimpressive figure without his wig and gown. Clothes are an important part of ceremony, whether it is connected with belief, the law, parliament, and royalty, the fighting forces or the state. How very different the Queen's Coronation ceremony   would have looked without the robes, coronets and the cloth of gold.\nSometimes, even in some modern countries people wear some article of clothing, or some jewel, because they believe that it will bring them luck or protect them from evil or illness, or because it is connected with their beliefs.\nNone of these reasons for wearing clothes -- to decorate ourselves, to show our position in the world, for ceremonial purposes, for \"luck\", to give ourselves dignity and authority -- have anything to do with our need for warmth.", "id": "high16934.txt"}
