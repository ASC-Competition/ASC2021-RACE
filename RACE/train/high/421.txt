But that grey afternoon saw it just as my son and daughter were making a terrible mess on the floor in the kitchen.\nWith a tiresome report to write, I felt bothered at my desk. Suddenly, it occurred to me that my kids were at fault. A voice inside me insisted that I do something quickly.\n\"Ok, you two here, but what an awful thing you are attempting!\" I was shouting angrily. I made for them, while it became evident that _ \"Get away from us!\" he shouted back, there being an expression of support from his sister.\nAll of a sudden, I found the fault in myself. Quickly I shaped my hands into pincers and crawled towards them, \"Crabby Daddy is here. Ha, Ha, Ha, he likes to yell at children, and then eat them!\" My son continued to keep me away, but now he was laughing and crying at the same time. My mission to repair the damage caused by my yelling seemed to work well. Still, I regretted not having controlled myself first in a right way.\nNeed I let them know how badly they were acting by blaming? This is a lesson that serves myself. It only shows just how to get rid of something (ill-feelings, responsibility...) by blaming others. It's not my \"best self\".\nWe have to search for our \"best self\" when with our children. They don't need perfect parents, but they do need parents who are always trying to get better. Here, I am reminded of the words of a great thinker. \"When a man lives with God, his voice shall be as sweet as the murmur of the book...\" Then, in our lifetime, couldn't we always speak to our kids in such a sweet voice since most of us consider them as the most precious in the world? And before we reach this level, what should we do when we come across various difficult cases with our children?", "id": "high421.txt"}
