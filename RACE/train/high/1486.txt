How could we be using them?\nSome culture jammers are using other methods to challenge how people think.Some pretend to be shoppers.They move items in stores from one shelf to another making it difficult for people to find things easily.Other culture jammers break into large company well sites and jam them so that they become unusable.The goal in both cases ia to prevent \"Business as usual\" and to gel people to ask themselves questions such as \"Why am I shopping here?\" or \"Why should I buy this product?\"\nLasn and members of the Culture Jammers Network want to make people aware of social issues, but they also believe it's important to think of solutions, too.\"A lot of people tell you everything that's wrong but they never say much about how to fix these problems,\" says Lasn.\"But there is plenty we can do.If you start despairing, you have lost everything.\"\nThough many TV stations still won't show Adbusters' \" uncommercials\" , some cable TV stations have started to.People all over the world have joined the Culture Jammers Network and are doing their part to promote social change.", "id": "high1486.txt"}
