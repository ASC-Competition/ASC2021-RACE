Like a lot of people who want to get through a checkout line, my thoughts were on speed, nothing more. The line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier.\nThere stood a man in his seventies. Of average build, he wore glasses and a nice smile. I thought, \"Well, he's an old guy and it probably takes him a little longer to get the chores done.\"\nFor the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before he began scanning the items they were purchasing. Sure, his words were the usual, \"How's it going?\" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation.\nI thought it was strange, but I guess I had grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of a robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, \"I just found out I have six months to live,'' and someone would reply, \"Have a great day!''\nThis old cashier had my attention. He seemed genuine  about wanting to know how people were feeling. And after giving them the change, the old cashier looked the customers in the eyes. \"I sure want to thank you for shopping here today, ''he told them. \"You will have a great day. Bye-bye.\"\nThe looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some shy grins  .All had been touched by his simple gesture in a place they never expected.", "id": "high13367.txt"}
