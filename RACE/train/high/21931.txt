His poor jacket, patched  trousers, and worn-out shoes made him stand out from the usual Saturday morning breakfast crowd. Unforgettable were his pale blue eyes that shone like diamonds, large rosy cheeks, and thin lips held in a steady smile. \n  He walked toward a table by the window. A young waitress watched him and ran over to him, saying, \"Here, Sir. Let me give you a hand with that chair.\"\n  Without a word, he smiled and nodded a thank you. She pulled the chair away from the table. Supporting him with one arm, she helped him move in front of the chair, and get comfortably seated. Then she pushed the table up close to him, and leaned his cane against the table where he could reach it.\n  In a soft, clear voice he said, \"Thank you, Miss.\"\n\"You are welcome, Sir.\" She replied. \"My name is Mary. I'll be back in a moment. If you need anything, just wave at me!\"\nAfter he had finished a hearty meal of pancakes, bacon, and lemon tea, Mary brought him the change, helping him up from his chair and out from behind the table. She handed him his cane, and walked with him to the front door. Holding the door open for him, she said, \"Come back and see us, Sir!\"\nHe nodded a thank you and said softly with a smile, \"You are very kind!\"\nWhen Mary went to clean his table, she was shocked. Under his plate she found a business card and a note written on the napkin , under which was a $100 bill.\nThe note on the napkin read, \"Dear Mary, I respect you very much, and you respect yourself, too. It shows by the way you treat others. You have found the secret of happiness. Your kind gestures will shine though those who meet you.\"\nThe man she had served was the owner of the restaurant. This was the first time that she, or any of his workers, had seen him in person.", "id": "high21931.txt"}
