They map and analyze  the housing , energy , and transportation requirements of their own district and foretell its needs in 100 years . With the aid of an architect  who visits the classroom once a week , they invent new ways to meet these needs and build models of their creations . \"Designing buildings of the future gives children a lot of freedom,\" says the teacher who developed this program. \"They are able to use their own rich imagination and inventions without fear of blame , because there are no wrong answers in a future context . In fact , as the class enters the final model-building stage of the program , an elected \"official\" and \"planning group\" make all the design decisions for the model city , and the teacher steps back and becomes an adviser .\"\nCBEP is a set of activities , games , and imitations that teach the basic steps necessary for problem-solving ; observing , analyzing, working out possible answers , and judging them based on the children's own standards .", "id": "high21582.txt"}
