In the computer science course at Changsha University of Science Technology (CUST),students can voice opinions via their cell phone. \"I open a micro-blog webpage,and when students text a message to the account, it appears on the screen,,,said teacher Huang Qiang. Su Ying, 19,a sophomore at CUST, said: \"I feel relaxed as I don't like standing up and getting everybody's attention. \"", "id": "high23685.txt"}
