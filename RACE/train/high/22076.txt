He beat 34,000 candidates from 200 countries in an online competition that became something of an Internet phenomenon. \n\"To go away now as the island caretaker for Tourism Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef is an extreme honour. I hope I can fill the boots as much as everybody is expecting, my swimming hopefully is up to standard and I look forward to all of the new roles and responsibilities that the task involves.\" [Ben Southall] \nFor a disappointing Australian tourism industry currently in the  _ , this has been an unexpected encouragement. Tourism Queensland deliberately chose the middle of winter of the northern globe to launch the campaign back in January, but didn't expect anywhere near the global response. They think the only countries where people didn't visit their website was North Korea and a few African nations.\nWhat's said to be the best job in the world comes with a $110,000 (about 750,000 yuan) contract for six months' work, a luxury beachside home and a plunge pool. \nIn return, the island caretaker will be expected to stroll  the white sands, enjoy the sun, diving and taking care of the reef, \"maybe clean the pool\"-- and report to a global audience via weekly blogs , photo diaries and video updates.\nFor the losers meanwhile, there's the worst of long journeys home.", "id": "high22076.txt"}
