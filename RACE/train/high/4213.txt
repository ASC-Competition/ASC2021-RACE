Smoking behavior was analyzed by looking at a person's tobacco consumption level, number of years smoked, and current smoking status. Researchers then followed participants through December of 2002, noting the number of deaths that occurred.\nThe study involved researchers from the National Cancer Institute, the University of Minnesota and the American Registry of Radiolegic Technologists.\nKey Findings:\n20 percent of obese adults in the United States smoke.\nObese smokers face a greater risk of death from cancer and circulatory disease.\nCurrent smoking is a greater risk factor for death by cancer than obesity is, generally speaking.\nThe higher a person's pack-years (number of packs smoked per day times the number of years smoked) are, the greater the risk of death.\nMen and women of all ages faced an elevated risk of death due to circulatory disease as BMI increased. And for those who were both obese and currently smoking, risk of circulatory disease increased 6 to 11 times under the age of 65, as compared to their never-smoking, normal weight counterparts.\nWhile it's not surprising that obesity coupled with smoking is a recipe for trouble, it is important to highlight this growing health concern in America today.\nTaking Charge of Your Health\nMaking healthy choices can be difficult when we're constantly bombarded with products that are hazardous to our health, but it's not impossible. With education and some motivation, we all have the ability to make lasting changes for the better. If you're an overweight smoker worried about gaining weight due to quitting, take heart. It's never too late to change your course and even reverse damage to some extent.", "id": "high4213.txt"}
