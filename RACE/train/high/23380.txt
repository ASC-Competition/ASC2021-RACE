This was not because the woods and fields were always far away, but because they were too far from the city to permit people to make a day trip between morning and nightfall.\n         In 1907, a young German schoolmaster had an idea which changed this state of affairs. He decided to turn his little schoolhouse into a dormitory for the summer holidays. Anyone who brought his sleeping bag and cooking equipment along could stay there for a very small quantity of money. The idea was a success. A few years later, the schoolhouse was much too small to hold the many young people who wanted to stay there. As a result, a dormitory was set up in an old castle nearby. This was the first Youth Hostel.\n         Today, young students and workers of every country can meet in the hostels and get to know each other. When young people arrive at a hostel, they have only to show their card of membership in a hostel organization in their own country. This card will permit them to use the facilities of hotels all over the world for a very low price.\n         Often, at the evening meal, a group of boys and girls from various parts of the country or the world will happen to meet at the same hostel. They may put their food together and prepare a dinner with many kinds of dishes. Sometimes a program will be organized after the meal, with dances, songs, or short talks followed by a question period. One can learn a lot of things about other places, just by meeting people who come from those places. For this reason, a few weeks spent \"hosteling\" can be just as useful a part of one's education as classes in school.", "id": "high23380.txt"}
