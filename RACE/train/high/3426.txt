Researchers believe this is not just because the spouses were spending more time together, but because they were able to enjoy each other's company more.\nOne of the participants in the study,which is published in the journal Psychological Science,said:\"Once the kids grow up...there's some of that stress removed...that responsibility removed,so things are a little more relaxed.\"\nPsychologist Sara Gorchoff,who carried out the investigation,said: \"The takehome message for couples with young children is 'hang in there'.\" Her coauthor Oliver John added:\"Don't wait until your kids leave home to schedule quality time with your partner.\"\nHowever, Dr Dorothy Rowe,from the British Psychological Society,said the effects of living in an \"empty nest\" will depend on the parents' relationship with their children.\"If you're just waiting for them to leave home so you can get on with your life,then of course you'll be pleased to see them go,\" she said, \"But if you've built your life around your children you'll be terribly lonely.For some parents,their world falls apart when their children leave.\"", "id": "high3426.txt"}
