She is remote from literary fashions, and she has never learned to intellectualize her art, but she reads her critics and takes them seriously.\nClock Without Hands depicts   Mrs McCullers' native South and the slow passing of the old way of life through the lives of a dying pharmacist  , a white judge and former congressman, his rebellious grandson, and two Negroes. Among her earlier noted works are Member of the Wedding, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, and Ballad of Sad Cafe.", "id": "high23078.txt"}
