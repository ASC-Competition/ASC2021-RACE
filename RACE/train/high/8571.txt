His classic tale of a poor orphan boy strikes at the heart of all those who have ever wanted \"more\", as Oliver did.\nAnd now, Dickens' classic scenes of the lives of the Victorian British poor will appear in a big screen movie, \"Oliver Twist,\" an adaptation of his classic tale directed by Roman Polanski.\nThe new film is not meant for younger viewers, and is meant for children over 13. For those old enough to enjoy it, however, the film shows just how long people have been enjoying Dickens' remarkable literature. His short stories and essays began appearing in magazines in 1833. \"Oliver Twist\" was published in 1837 - more than 165 years ago.\n\"Oliver Twist\" tells the story of an orphan forced to live in a workhouse headed by the awful Mr Bumble, who cheats the boys who work there out of their already low pay. Oliver decides to escape to the streets of London, where he meets a thief called Fagin, played by Sir Ben Kingsley, who leads him into a world of crime. Several of Dickens' books have been made into films and television series, including 2002's \"Nicholas Nickleby\" and 2000's \"David Copperfield.\" And several versions of \"A Christmas Carol\" have entertained audiences for years.\nIn his novels, Dickens wrote about several important issues. He talked about the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1824 in \"Oliver Twist\"; the French Revolution in \"A Tale of Two Cities\"; and helping the poor in \"Hard Times.\" One of Dickens' best-known books is the first Christmas book he wrote - \"A Christmas Carol\" (1843), about a mean man.\nWe thought this would be a good time to take a look at the man behind the words and see what kind of experiences helped shape and affect one of the best -- known writers of all time.", "id": "high8571.txt"}
