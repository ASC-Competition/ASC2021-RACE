I wanted to work with animals you wouldn't find in your house.\"\nBefore coming to Miami, Frame worked with his vet Dr. Reid. He learned about the details of being a vet from him. Working with small animals, Frame observed many procedures there.\nFrame also worked with another vet at Oxford University during his first year at Miami, which involved a leadership position. \"I'm in charge of a high school kid,\" Fram said, \"He sometimes needs to be motivated. I like his support system.\"\nTo realize his goal, Frame began working at the Wilds in Cumberland, Ohio after he met Reid.\nThe Wilds is a non-profit conservation center and is the home for rare and endangered animals. The Wilds combines the concepts of conservation science and education programs to mainly children.\nAfter his first year at Miami, Frame began to educate children about the animals. \"I think teaching children is an enjoyable experience, especially when they're really interested in animals,\" Frame said.\nFrame also explained if a vet school didn't work out, he would be interested in working in animal education. \"I would at least have a Zoology degree,\" Frame said, \"The wilds is connected to many zoos all over the country, so I'm sure I can find a job in education.\"\nFor now, Frame plans to continue working at the wilds this coming summer with a new job at hand, which involves teaching the public about the endangered animals they are protecting and doing shows with owls.\nWhile Frame is still an undergraduate student at Miami, he continues his passion for animals. Becoming an exotic vet may be a few years down the road, but Frame continues to work had for this dream, hoping it will become a great reality.", "id": "high17587.txt"}
