But three years after moving to Shanghai to pursue their dream, Oliver's husband died, leaving her alone to follow their shared passion for t'ai chi.\nTwenty years ago, Oliver's back injury ruined her childhood dream of becoming a ballet dancer. But the injury did lead her to t'ai chi, a martial art   typically practiced in slow motion. Her initial hope was to improve her health. She later married her instructor, Rey Nelson, and founded a school with him, teaching the martial art to more than 10, 000 students over eight years.\nThe 49-year-old recalls the injury that left her bedridden for six months when she was 21 years old and with constant pain for decades.\n\"I was active and could not bear resting in bed,\" she recalls.\"But the soft tissue injuries were hard to heal. I thought I had to find some way to recover my health.\"\nOliver saw a poster for a t'ai chi class and decided to try the\"mysterious exotic sport\". She was struck by the beautiful movements and the\"nice, patient instructor -- Nelson\".\nThe couple later opened a t'ai chi school in the United Kingdom that attracted thousands of people. But they found themselves in a bottleneck.\n\"It was not enough for us to improve ourselves when we just learned from t'ai chi masters for two or four weeks a year,\"she says. So the couple moved to Shanghai. They taught English in universities and happily learned t'ai chi under various masters. After years of practice, Oliver found her occasional backaches had disappeared.\nIn 2003, her husband's death brought her much pain. She thought of giving up, but considering the career in which her husband took pride, she stuck to it.\nShe says her t'ai chi\"family\"-- the masters and students -- also provided a great support network. Her then tutor was Dong Bing and Dong died in 2009 at the age of 88.\nShe speaks of their first meeting:\"I had been told that his skill was of a very high level and for some reason I had a mental image of a powerful, big man. But my fellow pointed to a small, thin old gentleman, sitting on the ground.\n\"I felt amazed as I realized that this was the master himself, and then a sudden feeling of pleasure hit me. Of course this was exactly the kind of person who would be a t'ai chi master -- the last person you could imagine.\n\"I learned attentively from him. He did not only teach me physically t'ai chi but also the philosophy of how to be a better person, how to keep going when you felt you were tired.\n\"His idea is that one should not pursue wealth and fame but endeavor to be happy and share one's knowledge and wisdom with others.\"\nFollowing the master, Oliver learned to live a simple life -- one perhaps more traditional than many Chinese. She does t'ai chi in the morning and makes kung fu tea for guests. Ink-wash bamboo paintings hang on her apartment walls.\nOliver spends her time outside t'ai chi teaching English and attending cultural exchange events.\nShe founded the Double Dragon Alliance in 2005. The organization enables Chinese kung fu masters to teach martial arts to Westerners and organizes seminars and events for them to experience Chinese massage , acupuncture , traditional medicine, calligraphy  and tea ceremonies.\nBecause of her contribution to cultural exchange, Oliver was given the Shanghai Magnolia Award on Sept 30, 2013. The award, named after Shanghai's city flower, is given to foreigners who have made significant contributions to the city.", "id": "high19534.txt"}
