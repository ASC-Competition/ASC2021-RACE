You don't even need a sense of humor, no funny jokes or comedy programs -- just a willingness to laugh -- and in the present climate everyone needs to laugh more.\nLaughter Yoga is a combination of Laughter Exercises and Yogic Breathing, so that you increase the amount of oxygen in your body while being playful, resulting in you feeling healthier, energetic and alive. This actually changes the physical conditions of your body so that you start to feel happier.\nLaughter Yoga is generally done in groups although it can be practiced alone. When you make eye contact with someone and you're both willing to laugh, the laughter is increased. However, we do say that you can \"Fake   it, fake it till you make it\" because the body doesn't know the difference between fake and true laughter; as long as you're willing to laugh you'll experience the same health benefits.\nLaughter Yoga started in a park in Mumbai in 1995 with just 5 participants, and now there're over 6,000 laughter clubs in 60 different countries -- showing the willingness of the world to laugh together.\nIn the UK, Julie was one of the first people to train as a Laughter Leader with Dr Kataria in June 2002. In 2006 she was awarded Laughter Ambassador for her selfless service to promote Laughter Yoga.\n\"Yoga has been part of my life for 30 years but 7 years ago my life changed when I discovered Laughter Yoga. I believe laughter and yoga are both good for your health,\" says Julie.", "id": "high22417.txt"}
