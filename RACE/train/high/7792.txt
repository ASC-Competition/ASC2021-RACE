But because athletes competing at the 2004 Olympics have no choice but to stay in the hot weather, many plan to turn to science to stay cool.\nSome will put their hands in ice water just before competing and nearly all will be wearing fabrics  designed with hot weather in mind.\n\"Normally we warm up before exercise,\"said Gordon Sleivert, director of sports science and medicine at the Canadian Sport Center in Victoria, British Columbia.\"But in this case we're taking the warm out of warm up. It's like pre-cooling.\"\nExperts are predicting  the average high this August in Athens will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with temperatures often reaching above 100(the average temperature in Sydney for the 2000 summer games was 64).\nAlthough some events, such as the marathon, will start early(1 a.m.) to avoid hot weather, _        Drinking lots of water will help athletes keep cool, but humidity  remains a problem. The body's ability to cool down is weakened by damp air since sweat drips off the skin rather than evaporates ,resulting in dehydration  without the cooling.\n\"Getting hot is a real problem because when our brains heats up, the brain waves are more like when you're really sleepy. Everything feels harder,\" said Sleivert.", "id": "high7792.txt"}
