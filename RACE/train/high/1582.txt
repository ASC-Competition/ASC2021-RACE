Are you thinking of getting one? Jamie Simmonds has just signed up. Let's see how she's getting along.\nMy Diary\nMONDAY: I'm officially a Facebooker. I find a few people I used to know and I've soon got seven friends. I've never felt so popular! I wonder if my old university flatmate Steve is on here...What do you know! He is! Maybe Facebook has its uses.\nTUESDAY: I've received lots of nice welcoming messages on my wall. Later, I meet up with Steve for a drink after not seeing him for five years. We get on really well! Then, he uses his Facebook app for iPhone to suggest me as a friend to some other former classmates. Some of them even come to the pub and it's just like old times - possibly a bit too much like old times. During the night, photos are uploaded to Facebook.\nWEDNESDAY: Disaster! My mum's on Facebook! Has she seen the photos of me dancing on the table from last night? Has she shown them to dad? Oh. And I have a friend request - mum again!\nTHURSDAY: There's a message from my boyfriend, \"so, it's over then, ;is it?\" Evidently I haven't changed my settings to show I'm \"in a relationship\", and I haven't even added him as a friend. Ah, well, I wonder what my ex-boyfriend is doing... Whoops! I accidentally type his name into my status box instead of the search ' and now every one can see it on their news feed.'\nFRIDAY: Time to update my status:\"Work is boring. Can't wait for the weekend!\" Yeah, that about sums it up. Oh, look, I've received a comment! Someone must feel the same way. Lots of my friends now\"like\" this status.\nSATURDAY: Good news! I've got 100 friends But wait! _ I look through my \"friend list\" to try to work out who it was. Why did they do that? Am I really such a terrible person? I never knew Facebook could be this cruel.\nSUNDAY: Wake up. Check my Facebook page. Make coffee. Check my Facebook page again. Get ready to leave. Change my mind and check my Facebook page ... again. I am becoming addicted to it! I think it's time to end it all before it takes over my life. I delete my account. Back to good, old, simple e-mails. Oh, look, I've got a message: A friend invited you to join Twitter. . .\nIn July 2010, Facebook had more than 500 million active users.
