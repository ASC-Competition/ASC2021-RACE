And then when people don't behave as we want them to, we feel so disappointed and angry --- when really, most times, we're not actually surprised at their actions? We just want those actions to be different --- actions we'd be more comfortable with.\nThis week I shared a friend a wonderful home-cooked meal and a bottle of wine. About the time we got to the freshly-baked cookies, the conversation turned to her somewhat crazy sister. I had to smile, just a little, since her sister-stories had had much the same theme for the last two decades.When her frustration was just about to peak over her sister's latest unbelievably selfish act, I suggested she begin trying \"The Law of Patient Acceptance.\" \"How can I possibly accept her behavior?\" my friend asked. \"Acceptance doesn't necessarily mean tolerance,\" I shared. \"It just means that you accept the person for who they are and you stop knocking yourself out trying to change them.\"\nEveryone has these difficult people in their lives from time to time. \"Think of it this way,\" I said. \"If you were to go out and buy an ottoman  today, thinking you were buying a chair, you'd be really angry that the ottoman was such a pathetic  chair. But once you realize what you're dealing with, once you accept the ottoman for what it is and you stop trying to turn it into a chair, your anger largely goes away.\"\nYou have to accept people for who they are. Even when you've had high hopes that they might have been able to be someone else. \"You can't change people,\" my Mother always said. And she was right. The best we can do is to see people as clearly and objectively as possible. For they rarely change.", "id": "high16258.txt"}
