Make sure that you do not find yourself looking down or away. If you wear glasses, be sure to buy the non-glare lenses. Do not stare. \nRapidly nodding your head can leave the impression that you are impatient and too eager to add something to the conversation -- if only the interviewer would let you. Slower nodding, on the other hand, emphasizes interest, shows that you are validating   the comments of your interviewer, and encourages him to continue. Tilting   the head slightly, when combined with eye contact and a natural smile, shows friendliness and approachability  . \nYour smile is one of the most powerful positive body signals. Everybody looks better when they smile. Offer an unforced, confident smile. Avoid at all costs the technique that some applicants use: grinning idiotically   for the length of the interview, no matter what. This will only communicate that you are insincere  .\nIt's worth remembering that the mouth provides a seemingly limitless supply of opportunities to convey weakness. This may be done by touching the mouth frequently; \"faking\" a cough when confused with a difficult question; and /or gnawing   on one's lips absentmindedly  . Employing any of these \"insincerity signs\" when you are asked about say, why you lost your last job, will confirm   or instill    _ about your honesty.", "id": "high19987.txt"}
