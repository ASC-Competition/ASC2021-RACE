Fortunately, as McClelland noted in the news release, these social and behavioral skills can be taught, and the earlier adults step in to guide the student, the greater chances a child has to succeed academically.\n\"Academic ability carries you a long way, but these other skills are also important,\" McClelland said. \"Increasingly, we see that the ability to listen, pay attention, and complete important tasks is  _ for success later in life.\"", "id": "high22534.txt"}
