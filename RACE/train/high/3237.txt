It was my duty to help her get it done. One night she worked until midnight doing her homework.\nI felt annoyed, but I didn't want the teacher to think I was lazy. So I never complained. I wasn't sure, but it seemed to me that five hours of homework was a bit too much for a fifth grade student.\nLater, I found out that parents and educators have discussed about homework for more than a century. Parents who like more homework want to give their children every advantage to succeed in today's world. Some educators see homework as a way to help students perform better in tests.\nOther parents dislike the recent trend toward more homework. They don't want to stay up until midnight helping their children. They would prefer to spend their time going to the park or reading some really good books with their children. Added to the opposition are those who say that homework increases the gap between the rich and the poor. That's because middle class families do better when it comes to helping their children with their homework.\nSo, who is right? Is homework an enemy or a help? According to experts, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.", "id": "high3237.txt"}
