It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .\nOne girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. \"They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!\"\nAt that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!\nIt seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting \"perfection\" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.\nNo one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that \"perfection\" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.", "id": "high19088.txt"}
