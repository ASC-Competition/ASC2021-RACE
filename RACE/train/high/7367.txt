He was eleven years old when he came to Canada from Italy with his parents. \"Most of Toronto's immigrants are from lands where the marketplace has always been part of daily life,\" he said.\nSalvatori has been interested in getting an open-air market for Toronto for the last three years. This year, with the help of two fellow students, he prepared a proposal on the subject and presented it to the city's Executive committee, asking for their support. The proposal pointed out Toronto's rich variety of national groups, \"whose customs include market shopping.\"\nUnder a Canadian government program for multiculturalism, the three students have received two thousand dollars with which they will do a study to find out whether Toronto's immigrant businessmen would support an open-air market. They hope the merchants will support the plan strongly. \"A study done earlier this year showed that 90 percent of shoppers would be in favor of it,\" Salvatori said. \"At first it would be an experiment. But we think it will prove to be good business for the merchants, as well as tourist attraction.\"", "id": "high7367.txt"}
