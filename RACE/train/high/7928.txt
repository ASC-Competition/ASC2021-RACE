It was Christmas and his only friend Jacob Marley, had been dead for seven years. What was there for him to celebrate? He listened with growing anger to the people calling out greetings in the street and _ his nephew Bob Cratchit, who was just ready to go home. \"Merry Christmas, uncle,\" called Bob as he hurried out of the door.\nScrooge sighed. He might just as well go to bed. Aware that he should not waste his candle, he quickly undressed and climbed into bed. But no sooner had he done so than the ghost of Marley, covered in chains, appeared. \"What's the matter, Jacob?\" he asked. \"There are the chains I made in my life,\" answered the ghost. \"I'm forced to wander around with no rest and no peace. I have come here to warn you that if you do not change, this too will be your fate. You will be visited by three spirits. Expect the first one tomorrow when the clock strikes one. Expect the second and the third on the following nights at the same hour.\" With that Marley vanished. \"Nonsense!\" he said and going back to bed, fell fast asleep.\nWhen Scrooge awoke it was dark. The clock struck one. At the sound, light flashed into the room and there stood a young boy. \"Who are you?\" asked Scrooge in an unsteady voice. \"I'm the spirit of Christmas past,\" replied the spirit. \"Come with me.\" \"Do you remember this?\" he asked. Scrooge did. He heard the happy cries of people, and looking around he found himself, as he used to be, sitting on a chair and reading. It was a Christmas. Suddenly Scrooge watched his younger self joined in a band, dancing and laughing. \"Strange,\" said the spirit, \"that such little things should make people so happy.\" The ghost let him go and Scrooge sank down into a deep sleep.\nWhen he awoke again the second night, the clock sounded one again. Before he doubted the second spirit already turned up. The fat and jolly spirit was smiling,\"I'm the spirit of Christmas present.\"Again Scrooge grasped the spirit's hand and was transported to a small house filled with a number of children and their mother. \"Why, it's my nephew Bob's house,\" cried Scrooge in astonishment. His surprise increased when the door opened and in came Bob carrying a small, sick boy, Tiny Tim. \"Sit down,\" cried Bob to his family. \"Let's have the best Christmas dinner!\" They all began to eat eagerly. Scrooge watched at the happiness and contentment of his poor nephew's family. \"A Merry Christmas to us all!\" cried Bob. \"God bless us everyone!\" added Tiny Tim, who sat very close to his father and Bob held his thin hand tightly. \"No, not for the uncle, but for you and the children. Nobody knows better than you how mean that man is.\" exclaimed Bob's wife. \"Spirit,\" cried Scrooge. \"Will Tiny Tim live?\" \"If the future remains the same,\" said the spirit, \"there will be an empty chair next year.\" Again the spirit moved Scrooge away, and he fell asleep as he fell back into his bed.\nThe third night he woke and waited for the hour and the third spirit. This time the spirit didn't come in a flash of light but arrived quietly wearing a black cloth that covered its face and form. \"I'm the spirit of Christmas that is to come.\" The spirit pointed and led him to a large stone. It was at the foot of a grave  that was clearly neglected. Scrooge looked closer with trembling fingers and with horror read his own name on the stone. \"Oh, spirit, no, no!\" The spirit's finger remained steady pointing at the grave. \"I will honour Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year,\" cried Scrooge in terror. He reached out to hold the spirit's hand, but it slipped away. Scrooge looked around him. he saw he was in his own bed with his own thing around him.\n\"I have learned from the past, present and the future,\" he rushed to the window and shouted to the boys below: \"What day is it today?\" \"Why, it's Christmas Day,\" they replied in amazement. \"Wonderful,\" cried Scrooge. He rushed to his office to wait for Bob. When he entered, Scrooge pretended to look angry. \"Do you know what day it is, my boy?\" he asked Bob. \"I'm not going to stand for this any longer,\" he continued, \"and so I'm going to raise your salary.\" Bob looked amazed. \"A Merry Christmas, Bob,\" cried Scrooge slapping him on the back. \"I want to help you and your family. Let's talk about it this very afternoon.\"", "id": "high7928.txt"}
