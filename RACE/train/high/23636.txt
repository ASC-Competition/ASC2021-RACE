It's still unknown how animals can predict the weather, but limited research and acute observations have proved the animal kingdom's ability to notice changes before we do. Through their highly developed sense of hearing, smell and awareness of changes in atmospheric conditions, animals do appear to have a sixth sense that does allow them to predict certain weather conditions, earthquakes and tsunamis.\nLying cows are one of the most well-known natural weather indicators. If a cow lies in a field, it means rain is on the way, because cows sense the moisture  in the air and are making sure hay have somewhere dry to lie down.\nFish are known to eat more before a storm. Some say cats increase their grooming  activities when extra static electricity  is in the air, and horses are known to run fast before a violent storm or when windy conditions are coming. \nMeteorologist Randy Rauch of WTSP-TV in Clearwater confirms that animals can serve as severe weather barometers .\n\"It's actually been long believed that animals have a sixth sense when it comes to severe weather,\" Rauch said. \" It's long been talked about in folklore.
