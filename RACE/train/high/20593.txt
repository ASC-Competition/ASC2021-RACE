You'll be living in a world filled with smart robots, which will be helping you to take care of your children, or your elderly parents in your home. You'll live much longer thanks to the medicine made by genetic  science.  And mankind may be going farther in space than ever before---you will be living on the moon or Mars.\nHow should we view the changes that wait for us in the future? Should we be optimistic about the years ahead, or worried about what the future holds? Some scientists and experts are having a discussion about how technology, science and society will develop in the future.\n\"I'm looking forward to the day when more technology will come to my life.\" Says Hohn Searle, a professor at the University of California Berkeley Philosophy, \"because I think further research in such areas as genetics, physics, chemitry and medicine will help us to overcome poverty , improve health, and make life longer.\"\nHugh Herr, at MIT's Biomechatronecs Group, considers very powerful weapons   as concern  over the future. Another is the growing role of technology in our lives. \"Machines taking over what humans do is not a good thing,\" Herr says.\nThat is a similar concern shared by Danisla Cerqui, a social and cultural scientist. \"I am afraid that the long-term future we are building will have no space left for human beings,\"says Cerqui. \" The main values of our society are related to information that must progress as quickly as possible, and computers are much better than humans in these tasks.\"   (293words)", "id": "high20593.txt"}
