Do we or do we not go on holiday? My wife says no because we have no savings to save us. I say you only live once and we work hard and what's the point if you can't go on holiday.

For many families the recession means more than not booking a holiday A YouGov survey of 2, 000 people found 22% said they were arguing more with their partners because of concerns about money. A recent research shows arguments about money were especially damaging to couples.\nKim Stephenson, an occupational psychologist, believes money may be different things to men and women. \"People can say the same things about money but have different ideas of what it's for.\" he explains. \"They'll say it's to save, to spend, for security, for freedom, to show someone you love them.\" He says men are more likely to see money as a way of buying status and of showing their parents that they've achieved something.\n\"The biggest problem is that couples assume each other know what's going on with their finances, but they don't.
