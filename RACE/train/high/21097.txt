They face many forms of discrimination -- including beliefs that their condition was caused by a curse. But one father whose son Brain was born deaf, mute and blind aims to change all that. Joseph Shiroko started a school four years ago that teaches students who can not hear, speak and who have very low or no vision a wide range of skills to support themselves.\n         The baby clothes the students knit  are well known in the local community. And the school has developed a reputation for its dried smoked meat products.\n         Brain Resource Center, a boarding school, teaches deaf and blind young Kenyans from across the country a variety of skills they can use to earn a living.\n         \"We have a number of philosophies that inform what we are doing: accepting these people; loving them; giving them opportunities.\" said founder Joseph Shiroko.\n         Teachers, most of whom are graduates from the school or are themselves physically challenged, work with students.\n         Mary Kerubo, 22, has a passion for knitting sweaters, which she plans to continue in her village.\n         \"I feel comfortable here because Sween -- my teacher understands me,\" said Kerubo. \"Even if I do not see well, she always repeats her lessons again and again so that I may understand how to make sweaters. I know I will make it.\"\n         Kerubo's teacher, Sween Lyaka, was among the first graduates of Brain Resource Center four years ago. She says her students have a lot of unrecognized potential.\n         Sween says in the future, she plans to purchase four sewing machines that she will use to teach students and produce and sell sweaters in her home village.\n         The center also works with students' families to set up projects that will continue after the students graduate.\n         Founder Joseph Shiroko's son, Brain, was the inspiration behind Brain Resource Center. The senior Shiroko says he began the school initially as a project to teach Brain bakery skills. The family later expanded Brain's training and brought in other young people with similar physical conditions.", "id": "high21097.txt"}
