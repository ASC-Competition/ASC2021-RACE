He put his picture in the field. Soon the birds came and tried to eat the apples. The old man saw it and said, \"You have certainly won. Mr. White cannot draw so good a picture as yours. But we will go to see his picture.\"\nThey went to Mr. White's house. There were nothing but red beautiful curtains on the wall. The old man asked, \"Where is your picture, Mr. White?\" He said, \"Lift the curtains, and you will find my picture.\" The old man tried to lift the curtains but found that they were drawn there.
