One of them was a Hungarian man. He lived in Australia for quite a long time, and he had a lot of good friends there. He always said to them, \"Australia is beautiful, but Hungary is beautiful, too.\" Then one year he said to his friends, \"I'm going to go back to Hungary to visit my home town.\" All his friends said to him, \"We want to go with you, because you often say Hungary is a beautiful country, and we want to visit it.\" The Hungarian Australian took his friends from Sydney to Rome in a big plane, and then they went from Rome to Budapest in a train as they wanted to see the mountains, and the villages and the towns.\nThey stayed in Budapest nearly a week, and they liked it very much. One day they went to the zoo in Budapest and saw two kangaroos there.\nThese Australians were very happy because kangaroos were from their home town. They said to them, \"Come here, old friends! Come and see your Australian brothers!\" But the kangaroos did not move.\nBut then the Hungarian Australian spoke to them in Hungarian, \"Come here!\" he said, and both of the kangaroos ran to him.\nThe other Australians laughed and said, \"Look at that. They're Australians, but they only know Hungarian!\"", "id": "high18678.txt"}
