When we were seated, my dad asked the waitress if there were any soldiers eating at the restaurant. Then waitress said there was a soldier having dinner with his friend. My dad told the waitress to tell the soldier and his friend that their dinner was paid for! He also said that he did not want to be known as the benefactor .\nThen waitress later commented on my dad's thoughtful behavior saying that she had never seen anything like this before. At a local college, she had studied opera and so she used this to thank my dad by performing a piece from The Pearl Fisherman. Her voice brought me to tears because it sounded perfect!\nAfter a while, the soldier appeared at our table (I don't know how he knew my dad paid the bill for him.) and said that he would be sent to the front the next morning and that he could not leave this country without saying \"thanks\" to my dad. My dad replied that it was he who wanted to say \"thanks\". They shook hands as the soldier left.\nBefore we left, the waitress came by again. She did a magic show as another way to show her \"thanks\" to my dad. Her show was really great. My dad left her a note with email address asking for her next performance time in addition to a $ 50 tip.\nEveryone witnessed something exemplary  in the human spirit that night. I can only hope to see more of this in the future.", "id": "high8821.txt"}
