Two of his names-Santa Claus and Saint Nicholas-both come from the Dutch who settled in New York long ago. The Dutch honored this kindly saint with a yearly festival on December sixth. The Dutch spoke the name \"Saint Nikolas\" very fast. It sounded like \"sinterklaas\". And so, when the English said this word, it sounded like \"Santa Claus\". \nWest of New York, in Pennsylvania, many German farmers had also heard of Saint Nikolas. But they cal1ed him \"Pelznickel\". This word came from \"pelz\", meaning fur, and \"nickel\" for Nicholas. So, to the Germans of Pennsylvania,\"Pelznickel\" was a man dressed in fur who came once a year with gifts for good children. Soon, people began to feel that the 1ove and kindness Pelznickel brought should be part of a celebration honoring the \"Christkindl\", as the Germans ca1led the Christ child. After a time, this became Kris Kringle. Later, Kris Kringle became another name for Santa Claus himself.\nWhatever he is called, he is still the same short, fat, jolly old man with a long beard, wearing a red suit with white fur.\nThe picture of Santa Claus as we see him came from Thomas Nast. He was an American\npainter born in Bavaria. Someone asked him to paint a picture of Santa Claus. Nast remembered when he was a little boy in southern Germany Every Christmas, a fat old man gave toys and cakes to the children. So, when Nast painted the picture, his Santa Claus looked like the kindly old man of his childhood. And through the years, Nast's painting has remained as the most popular picture of Santa Claus.\nSanta can be seen almost everywhere. It is easy to find them by the long lines of children waiting to tell Santa what they want for Christmas.", "id": "high23592.txt"}
