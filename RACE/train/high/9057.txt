They explained that in previous research they had used similar playback experiments to show that elephants could tell --- from the sound of a lion's roar --- whether the animal was a female or a more dangerous male.\nProf McComb wanted to find out if the animals used their very sharp sense of hearing to identify a potential danger from humans.\nThe scientists recorded Masai men, women and children saying, in their own language, \"Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming\".\nThey also recorded Kamba men saying this phrase.\nWhile cattle-herding Masai people often come across free-ranging elephants, which can result in violent conflict, the Kamba people's more agricultural lifestyle does not generally bring them into aggressive touch with the animals.\nWhen the team played recordings of these different voices through a hidden loudspeaker, they found that elephant family groups reacted more fearfully in response to the voice of a Masai man, than to a Kamba man's voice.\nAnd the adult male Masai voices encouraged far more of these defensive reactions than the voices of women or boys.", "id": "high9057.txt"}
