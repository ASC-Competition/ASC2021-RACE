My father was a man of few words. Whenever I wanted his permission for a certain activity, I planned a speech that included who would be there, where it would take place, how long it would last, and why it was an incredibly wonderful opportunity for me. He would listen and then say either \"Yes\" or \"No.\" There were never any qualifiers; not \"Yes, but be home by dinner\" or \"No, unless you can convince me otherwise.\" It was yes or no, plain and simple.\nMy father's phone messages were also lessons in patience and long-suffering to a teenage girl. I was quite active in high school. Not only did I enjoy being involved in many areas, but I came into contact with many a great teenage guy. I can recall one busy day when I had met two great guys and had given each of them my phone number. The first words out of my mouth when I walked through the front door were, \"Dad! Did anyone call?\" His answer, of course, was simply \"Yes\".I required for a more accurate description of the caller. His answer: \"A boy.\" Since I had met two guys that day, this did not help me. I ran to my room in tears.\nKnowing my dad's dislike of language in general and his fondness for briefness, it surprised me to hear that he was going to teach the eleven-year-old boys' Sunday school class. He did so for not one, but many years. I always wondered if he actually said anything, or if they all just sat in their chairs and stared at each other. I was sure that if people were waiting on my father to _ with brilliant conversation or a springboard comment, they'd be badly disappointed. Still, September after September, my father hung his sign outside the Sunday school room: Mr. Ernst--Eleven-Year-Old Boys.", "id": "high6629.txt"}
