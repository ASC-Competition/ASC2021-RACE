China opposes the use of threat or force to achieve regime change in other countries. This agrees with China's long-standing diplomacy principle. It is also not acceptable for China to rush a U.N. vote without sufficient discussion.\"\nSo why did China use its veto this time?\nChina's critics say China's veto of the U.N. draft proposal  was in part due to Beijing's fear that allowing a regime change in Syria could encourage the spread of the Arab revolution and eventually threaten China.\nHe Wenping disagrees, \"China has a completely different political system and economic development path. If someone in the international community thinks that the Arab Spring will happen in China, then I think they misjudge the situation in China, exaggerate  some problems in the Chinese society and underestimate the ability of the Chinese government to control the situation in China.\"", "id": "high15546.txt"}
