Sherman suggests that Barbie and similar dolls are part of the burden of early and inappropriate sexuality placed on girls. \nSherman and Zurbriggen used girls' doll play to study the impact of gender role socialization, a process through which children learn to follow cultural norms and which encourages gender stereotypical   behavior.\nThirty-seven girls from the age of four to seven from an Oregon college town were randomly arranged to play for five minutes with either a sexualized Doctor Barbie or Fashion Barbie doll, or with a more neutral   Mrs. Potato Head doll. The girls were then shown photographs of ten occupations and asked how many they themselves or boys could do in the future.\nThe girls who played with a Barbie doll saw themselves in fewer occupations, compared with boys. Those girls who played with Mrs. Potato Head reported nearly as many career options available for themselves as for boys.\nThe two Barbie dolls were the same except for clothing, with unrealistic bodies, extremely youthful and attractive faces, and long full hair. The researchers believe that the doll itself has more of an effect on girls than the role or career aspirations suggested by its costume.\n\"It's significant that a few minutes of play with a Barbie doll had an immediate impact on the number of careers that girls saw as possible for themselves,\" Zurbriggen said.", "id": "high19170.txt"}
