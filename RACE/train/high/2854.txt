It was a situation that could have ended with a tragedy for Patrick, his father and his sister. But it didn't really happen thanks to Patrick.\nThat morning, Patrick's father was driving down busy Interstate 95 in Peabody, Massachusetts. The car started going really slowly, which seized Patrick's attention. And then he realized that something was wrong. At that point, Patrick found his father was having a seizure  .\n\"It was really scary,\" he said. \"It was unlike anything that had ever really happened to me.\" But Patrick didn't act scared. He took control of the situation and got behind the wheel of the SUV. He turned the key off and pulled the car over to the breakdown lane  . He then stopped the SUV, grabbed a cell phone out of his dad's pocket and called 911 for help.\nPatrick's 9-year-old sister was in the SUV, too. He told his little sister not to worry about it. Then he opened the door and stood right next to the guard rail. Thanks to Patrick's description of their location during the 911 call, Massachusetts State Police were able to locate the Canneys within minutes -- and get them all to safety.\n\"A 12-year-old boy's clear thinking and decisive action actually saved this family from a tragedy,\" said state police spokesman David. \"That's Patrick. He is cool and _ . I couldn't imagine what would be the result if he were panicked  .\"\nPatrick's father was expected to recover fully from the seizure. And thanks to Patrick, all of the Canneys are still alive. \"The word hero may be overused in our society,\" said David. \"But Patrick is surely that -- and then some.\"", "id": "high2854.txt"}
