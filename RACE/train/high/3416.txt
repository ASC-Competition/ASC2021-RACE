And before I knew it , the SAT was before me. I wasn't sure  if I was ready, but I knew one thing: I wanted to get it over with.\nSAT for the students is like tooth pulling. For those smart Asian kiddos, it's like walking through the park: easy and carefree. _ \nAs I arrived outside of the dining hall, already a mob of students were sitting, talking, or standing silently waiting to get in. Jones students are lucky not only to have such a testing center at school, but also the feeling of their home school where it feels comfortable and familiar.\n\"ID, please,\" my former math teacher asked at the door.\n\"Okay.\" She looked over my ID, checked off my name on her list, and pointed towards the dining hall tables inside.\nWith hesitation, I picked up my feet and was directed to a large round table in the middle of the dinning hall. At least fourteen people could sit at this table but only four were allowed to take their test here.\n\"I'm glad it's multiple choices.\" I heard one student say. All the questions on the test have five choices except for one math section where they have only four. If you get an answer wrong, you don't get any point, plus you get a penalty of a 1/4 point. If you don't answer a question, you don't get any point, nor penalties.\nWhen everyone had a seat and the actual SAT I booklet in front of them, the proctor of the test called for our attentions. \"In front of you, you should have a SAT I test and a scantron . Please do not open the test booklet until I say so.\" He then went on to talk about the procedures, the amount of time, signature of honesty, etc. After thirty minutes of instruction reading, he gave us all a solemn expression before saying, \"You may begin now. Good luck.\"\nI could hear a hundred booklets being opened and pencils scratching the surface. I looked to my right, I looked to my left, I did a quick prayer for whoever was in charge up in the heavens, and started my test. At least I wouldn't know my score until summer time.", "id": "high3416.txt"}
