If I have dinner with a Chinese host, he always puts more food onto my plate as soon as I have emptied it. That often discomforts(......) me greatly. I have to eat the food even if I do not want to. I have also noticed that when a Chinese sits at an American's dinner party, he very often refuses the offer of food or drink though he's in fact still hungry or thirsty. This might be good manners in prefix = st1 /China, but it is not in the West at all. In theUnited States, it is impolite to keep asking someone again and again or insist on his accepting something. Americans have a direct way of speaking. If they want something, they will ask for it. If not, they will say, \"No thanks.\" When an American is served with beer by the host, for example, he might say, \"No, thanks. I'll take some orange juice if you have it.\" That is what an American will do. So when you go to theUnited States, you'd better remember the famous saying: \"When inRome, do as Romans do.\"", "id": "high17946.txt"}
