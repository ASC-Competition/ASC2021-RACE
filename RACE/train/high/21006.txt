For many of them, a summer or a semester in a foreign country now involves more than just sitting in classrooms and hanging out with other American students. Instead, they are encouraged and sometimes required to be involved in the local communities they are studying in.\n\"It's  ly important that they know something about how people in other parts of the world live and think, and how they behave,\" says William Finlay, head of the sociology department at the University of Georgia. In 2008, he co-founded a study abroad program with South Africa's Stellenbosch University. It combines traditional academic in-class learning with community involvement.\n\"We've been working with a non-government organization in the township. Our students typically either work with little children in day care centers or work in the library and teach very basic computer skills to young children,\" says Finlay.\nThe three-week program proved to be an unforgettable experience for Hillary Kinsey. She says, \"It was interesting to learn the history of the area and then talk to these people and see what the social dynamics were, and how certain groups felt about other groups.\"\nWhen Hillary Kinsey returned home from South Africa, she and other students in the program established a non-profit group. Kinsey says the group wants to contribute to advancing education and development in South Africa. \"One of the purposes of the group is that we hope to raise money and awareness about the situation where those people live and help to promote any sort of educational development that we can, \" Kinsey added.\nWhile many study abroad programs focus on helping Americans to learn foreign languages, others take a more intensive approach. \"In all of our locations, we place students with local roommates,\" says Mark Lenhart, director of CEF Academic Programs, which sends more than a thousand students to China, Korea and other countries each year.\nHe says American students benefit from such one-on-one interactions, in spite of the challenges they face. Lenhart says, \"They have to adjust to the local life. This will enable students to become more employable when they graduate.\"", "id": "high21006.txt"}
