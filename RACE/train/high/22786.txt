But they don't show teachers what will work: this book does.\nThe authors offer a research-based framework for classroom strategies that work with boys--and don't disadvantage girls.\nDescription\nBoys' education continues to be a focus of public anxiety among teachers. Concern about boys' general educational under-achievement and the impact this under-achievement has on the boys themselves, as well as on the broader society, continues to fuel disagreement and debate on the best approach to take in response.\nTeaching Boys provides a framework for developing practical and sustainable ways to improve boys' education. The book indicates how what teachers do in the classroom can enable boys' academic and social outcomes. With detailed case studies, Keddie & Mills outline a range of practical classroom strategies that will assist teachers to meet the challenge of teaching boys, without neglecting the girls in the process.\nAbout the Authors\nAmanda Keddie is a researcher at the University of Queensland. Her research interests and teaching areas focus on classroom teaching, curriculum and educational sociology.
