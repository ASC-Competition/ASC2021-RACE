Why? Because when money is spent, we can earn it back. However, when time is gone, it will never return. This is the reason why we must value time.\nThe time we can use is limited  . Therefore, even an hour is extremely  precious. We should  _ our time to do useful things. As students we must put more efforts into our lessons so as to serve society and our nation in the future.\nBut it is a pity that there are a lot of people who do not know the importance of time.

Do not put off   what can be done today until tomorrow.", "id": "high22179.txt"}
