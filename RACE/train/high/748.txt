At first, mobile phone companies thought that text messaging would be a good way to send messages to customers, but customers quickly began to use the text messaging service to send messages to each other. Teenagers in particular enjoyed using text messaging, and they began to create a new language for messages called texting.\nA text message is limited to 160 characters, including letters, spaces, and numbers, so messages must be kept short. In addition, typing on the small keypad of a cell phone is difficult, so it's common to make words shorter. In texting, a single letter or number can represent a word, like \"r\" for \"are,\" \"u\" for \"you,\" and \"2\" for \"to.\" Several letters can also represent a phrase, like \"lol\" for \"laughing out loud.\" Another characteristic of texting is the leaving out of letters in a word, like spelling \"please\" as \"pls.\"\nSome parents and teachers worry that texting will make children bad spellers and bad writers.
