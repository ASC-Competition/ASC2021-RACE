He kept it up during the summers for almost a decade. \"You get to know the course and can give the golf players advice about how to approach various holes,\" he says. \"Where else, at age 15 or 16, can you serve as a trusted adviser to high-powered people?\"\nOne of those people was George Sullivan, then president of Fidelity's funds, who was so impressed with Lynch's smarts that he hired him in 1966. \"There were about 75 applicants for 3 job openings,\" Lynch says now. \"But I was the only one who had caddied for the president for 10 years.\"\nIn between caddying and managing money, Lynch went to Boston College on a scholarship from a program called the Francis Ouimet Fund. Named after the 1913 winner of the U.S. Open, the fund launched in 1949 which is open to Massachusetts kids only. Ouimet executive director Robert Donovan says, \"Help with college is a logical extension of friendly relation between golfers and their favorite caddies, because there is a close tie to train up them to be excellent that happens between the players and the kids who carry their golf poles. And for the teens, caddying is all about being around successful role models.\"\nIt is obvious that caddies who are finally successful include all kinds of outstanding personnel, from actor Bill Murray, to New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, to former GE chairman and CEO Jack Welch.\nOf course, the great number of financial giants who caddied in their youth might be coincidence, but Dick Connolly thinks not. \"Caddying life teaches you a lot about business, and about life,\" he says. \"You learn to show up early and look people in the eye when you shake their hand, and you learn how to read people -- including who's likely to cheat and who isn't.\" Connolly is a longtime investment advisor at Morgan Stanley's Boston office, a former Ouimet scholarship student and, along with Peter Lynch and Roger Altman, one of the program's biggest supporters. He wants to share the most important lesson he learned on the links, so he says: \"One golfer I caddied for told me that if you want to succeed in any field -- golf or business -- you have to spend a lot of lonely hours, either practicing or working, when you'd rather be partying with your friends. That's true, and it stuck with me.\"", "id": "high17358.txt"}
