I told him that I couldn't do it. He asked, \"Why not?\" I paused, and then I said, \"Because I'm educable mentally retarded  .\" \n    He came from behind his desk and looked at me. \"Don't ever say that again. Someone's opinion of you does not have to become your reality,\" he said. \n    It was a very special moment for me. Doctors said that I was educable mentally retarded in the fifth grade, and I was put back into the fourth grade. When I was in the eighth grade, I failed again.\n   But Mr Washington changed my life. This person always gave students the feeling that he had high expectations of them, and then all of the students did their best to live up to what those expectations were. He often said, \"You have greatness within you.\" \n   One day, I caught up with him in the parking place and said, \"Mr Washington, is there greatness within me, sir?\" \n   He said, \"Yes, Mr Brown.\" \n   \"But what about the fact that I failed in English, math and history? What about that, sir? I'm slower than most kids.\" \n  \"It doesn't matter. It just means that you have to work harder. Your grades don't determine who you are or what you can produce in your life.\" \n  \"I want to buy my mother a house.\" \n  \"It is possible, Mr Brown. You can do that.\" And he turned to walk away. \n  \"Mr Washington?\" \n  \"What do you want now?\" \n  \"Uh, I'm the one, sir. One day you're going to hear my name. I'm the one, sir.\" \n  School was a real struggle for me. Mr Washington put many demands on me. He made me believe that I could do it. At the end of that year, I was on the honor roll for the first time in my life.\n  Years later, I produced five programs on public television. When one of my programs was shown on the educational television channel, I had some friends call him. I was sitting by the phone waiting when he called me. He said, \"May I speak to Mr Brown, please?\" \n  \"Oh, Mr Washington, is that you?\"\n  \"Yes, it's me. You were the one, weren't you?\" \n\"Yes, sir, I was.\"", "id": "high18139.txt"}
