But even at the height of my admiration, I couldn't agree with him that Anne, the main character inAnne of Green Gables, was \"the dearest and most loveable child in fiction since the best-known Alice\". I had readAnne of Green Gables as well asTom Sawyer, and she had made me as sick as a dog.\nAnother Mark Twain's quote will explain my problem. He said, \"When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant   that I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.\" I gradually understood his words as growing up. When I picked up the book again a few years later, I too was astonished at how much it had improved--and shortly afterwards shocked by the fact that not only could I be a fool in all sporting, artistic and practical matters, I could also be so when it came to reading too.\nOn rereading, then, I learned that Anne is indeed a dear and most lovable child. I couldn't help adoring the girl who insists that her name be spelled with the \"e\" instead of Ann as she believes that is \"so much more distinguished.\" She is a brave and determined survivor of a severe upbringing who has refused to let her circumstances crush her spirit. She arrives at Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert's farm with everything unfavorable--orphaned, unwanted and her biggest trouble of red-hair and freckled   face. However, she gets along well, through her strange way of seeing things, through her honest love of beauty and lovable attempts to master her unreasonable desires. She finally wins over the Cuthberts, their neighbors and millions of readers who have met her over the 101 years since the book was first published. \nWhen I settle down with it these days, I've come to see the truth in Mark Twain's praise for the book, and this reminds me of the great truth that you are never too young to start rereading.", "id": "high20940.txt"}
