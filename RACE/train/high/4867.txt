The average women's brain weighs 10% less than men's. Since researches have shown that the bigger the brain, the cleverer the animal, men must be more intelligent than women. Right? Wrong. Men and women always score similarly on intelligence tests, despite the difference in brain size. Why? After years of study, researchers have concluded that it's what's inside that matters, not just the size of the brain. The brain consists of \"grey matter\" and \"white matter\". While men have more of the latter, the amount of \"thinking\" brain is almost exactly the same in both sexes.\nIt has been suggested that smaller brain appears to work faster, perhaps because the two sides of the brain are better connected in women. This means that little girls tend to learn to speak earlier, and that women can understand sorts of information from different sources at the same time. When it comes to talking to the boss on the phone, cooking dinner and keeping an eye on the baby all at the same time, it's women who come out on top every time.\nThere are other important differences between two sexes. As white matter is the key to spatial  tasks, men know better where things are in relation to other things. \"A great footballer always knows where he is in relation to the other players, and he knows where to go,\" says one researcher. That may explain one of life's great mysteries--why men refuse to ask for directions ... and women often need to!\nThe differences begin when fetuses  are about nine weeks old, which can be seen in the action of children as young as one. A boy would try to climb a barrier   before him or push it down while a girl would attract help from others. These brain differences also explain the fact that more men take up jobs that require good spatial skills, while more women speech skills. It may all go back to our ancestors, among whom women needed speech skills to take care of their babies and men needed spatial skills to hunt, according to one research. www. .com\nIf all this disappoints you, it shouldn't. \"The brain changes throughout our lives according to what we do with it.\" says a biologist.", "id": "high4867.txt"}
