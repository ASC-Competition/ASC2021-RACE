But there are a few things in life I'd probably do differently if I had the chance.\nI once majored in architecture -- something I had been crazy about for as long as I could remember -- and then I suddenly had a change of heart. I made an appointment with my adviser, and told him I was no longer certain I wanted to pursue a career in architecture.\n\"Don't give up on your childhood dream!\" \"He's right,\" I thought. \"I should just stick it out and I shouldn't disappoint the little girl who once loved architecture.\"\nIt was awful.
