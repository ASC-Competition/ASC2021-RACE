Now, living alone 12 miles east of the town, Bill earned his living by hunting foxes and rabbits.\n\"Coming to the football match this afternoon?\" Bill McIntosh asked 54-year-old Royce Wedding as they drank beer at the Eureka Hotel. Royce shook his head, \"I promised Mom I'd burn off the weeds in one of our fields.\" \"I'll give you a hand,\" Bill said.\nDriving slowly from the southern edge of the field, they worked their way upwind, leaving a line of burning weeds in their wake. Suddenly the fire was on them. Bill pushed open his door only to find himself thrown through the air, the gasoline tank exploded and the car jumped three feet off the ground. When it crashed back down Royce found himself unable to move. Bill lay where he fell. \"Royce!\" he cried, struggling to his feet and heading for the car. Pulling open the door, he seized Royce's arms through the smoke. \"I'm stuck,\" Royce said. \"Get yourself away!\" The fire bit at Bill's arms, face and legs, but he said, \"I'm not leaving you here.\" Now Bill pulled as hard as he could. Suddenly he fell backward. Royce was free and out of the car.\n\"What's the matter with that dog?\" said Vicky Wedding, Royce's mom. Shocked by noise behind her, she turned to see Bill leaning against the door.\nSix months after the fire, when Royce went out of hospital, he walked into the Eureka Hotel and bought Bill a beer.", "id": "high13128.txt"}
