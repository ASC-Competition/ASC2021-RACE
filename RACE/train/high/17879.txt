The teenager came from a broken home, had dropped out of school and was living in local authority care.\nRogers, from Cumbria, England, won the National Lottery in 2003. Then she began spending her money wildly, buying four homes for her family, flash cars and designer clothes, partying and having some cosmetic  surgery. Two weeks after her win, she married and had two children. But then she spent 250 000 pounds on cocaine  and suffered depression. Earlier this year she lost the right to take care of her children because of her mental state.\nShe became addicted to drugs and attempted suicide three times as her life unraveled. She says the money brought her only misery. Now she is down to her last 100,000 pounds, she has never been happier.\nNow 22, she said: \"Just a few months ago I was taking too many drugs and hated myself. I simply did not want to live any more. But now I have a new man and am finally becoming the woman I want to be. And it's only after I've spent most of my fortune that this has finally happened.\"\n\"I need to get my act together and make my kids proud, and for the first time I really do think that's possible.\" She credits her new boyfriend with giving her the stable home life she has always longed for and she now hopes to go to college and eventually become a counselor. \"After all I've experienced, I think I have a lot of advice to offer,\" she said.", "id": "high17879.txt"}
