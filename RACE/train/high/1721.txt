The basic rule is simple: treat others in the same way you would want to be treated.   Imagine how you'd feel if you were in the other person's shoes.\nFor anything you're about to send: ask yourself, \"Would I say this to the person's face?\" if the answer is no, rewrite and reread.  Repeat the process till you feel sure that you'd feel comfortable saying words to a person's  face.\nIf someone in the chat room is rude to you, your instinct   is to fire back in the same manner. But try not to do so.  Just pay no attention to it, or block his message.  If it was caused by a disagreement with another member, try to fix the situation by politely discussing it. Remember to respect the beliefs and opinions of others in the chat room.\nEveryone was new to the network once.  Offer advice when asked by newcomers, as they may not be sure what to do or how to communicate. When someone makes a mistake, whether it's a stupid question or an unnecessarily long answer, be kind about it. If it's a small mistake, you may not need to say anything. Even if you feel strongly about it, think twice before saying anything. Having good manners yourself doesn't give you license to correct everyone else.\nIf you do decide to tell someone about a mistake, point it out politely At the same time, if you find you are wrong, be sure to correct yourself and apologize to those that you have offended.\nIt is not polite to ask others personal questions such as their age, sex and marital status. Unless you know the person very well, and you are both comfortable with sharing personal information, don't ask such questions.", "id": "high1721.txt"}
