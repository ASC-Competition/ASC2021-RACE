Asperger's Syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects a person's ability to socialize. But instead of putting them into prison for what they did to him, Gavin offered them a chance to become more tolerant and understanding.\nOn Thursday night, some kids were talking about how \"it's weird \" that he is always by himself, attending events alone and watching people, and it was \"creepy\" that he wanted to be friends with people he didn't know. \nOn Friday night, another kid that overheard that conversation decided to take matters into his own hands and become judge and jury, and this is the result of that. He didn't ask questions, didn't get to know Gavin, never met him, and didn't give him a chance to leave. Gavin was called to meet someone, surrounded by people he didn't know, choked, punched , and left lying on the pavement so he would \"learn his lesson\".\nGavin emerged from the attack with a concussion , a fractured nose, a bruised esophagus  and some damage to his eyes, but thankfully, none of the injuries resulted in permanent damage.\nBut here's the truly amazing part -- Gavin refused to press charges against the people who did this to him. Instead of wanting to see them punished, he wants to see them educated. Gavin asked that his attackers do community service that is disability-related. According to his mother, Gavin also asked that they watch a 20-minute video statement he taped while their families were present so they could see the damage they did and hear the event from his perspective.\n\"If you are reading this, I hope you talk to your teens,\" his mother wrote. \"Tell them about disabilities you can't see, teach them to be tolerant of people that are different, teach them that if they continuously see someone alone that maybe it is not their choice to be alone, remind them to ask questions first and get to know one another.\"", "id": "high19933.txt"}
