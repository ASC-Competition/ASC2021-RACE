But there were millions of them, which was why dad was so anxious to get rid of them.\n\"They're totally destroying our beans,\" he told Mom over lunchtime one Saturday. \"I've been trying to keep them out of the tomatoes, but I don't know if I can make it.\"\n\"Isn't there something you can do about them?\"Mom asked. She was mostly concerned about the tomatoes. \"I think there's a spray  or something,\" Dad said. \"I'm going down to the garden center after lunch and see if they have any suggestions.\"\nI'm pretty sure that's what he said. But what I heard was, \"While I'm gone, why don't you and George come up with your own plan for getting fid of the grasshoppers?\"\nAnd so that's what we did.

I looked at the insecticide he was carrying. \"But aren't you going to kill grasshoppers with that?\" I asked.\n\"Yes, because it's something we need to do for the protection of our garden,\" he said seriously. \"But I'm not going to enjoy it.\"", "id": "high23821.txt"}
