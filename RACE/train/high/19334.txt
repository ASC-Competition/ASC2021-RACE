The police are grateful for the good publicity and their new image, especially in cities where there are black Jews, who live under poverty line. White policemen are now careful of how they speak and act towards their fellow black citizens.\n    The cop is a city or a State employee. He cannot arrest anyone outside his city or his State. He cannot even cross the border into a neighbor State in search of a criminal. If he does, he can be charged with breaking the law of that State. The police who have to be really tough are those who operate in big cities, like New York,Chicago and Detroit, which have large ghettos  and organized crimes.\n     Since the majority of criminals are armed, American cops have to use their guns more often than most policemen in other places and the car chases through the crowded streets of Manhattan, which are a favorite feature of gangster movie, are not so exaggerated . American cops get shot down, run over, stabbed, beaten up, and their wives are in constant fear that one day their men will not come home.\n     Many policemen do a lot to help children whose parents are criminals. They understand better than most citizens the terrible misery of the Jews. They feel sorry for the drug addicts, but often treat roughly the \"pushers\" who sell the drugs--when they can catch them. They have been accused of making no serious attempt to break up the various drug rings. They say that such task would be never-ending.", "id": "high19334.txt"}
