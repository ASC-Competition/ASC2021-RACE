When it comes tostrong emotion, the onceseriousBritish are now happy to shed tears quite openly.\n\"Thirty percent of all British males have cried in the last month. That is a very high figure,\" said Peter Marsh, director of the Social Issues Research Center which took the emotional temperature of Britain. \"Only two percent said they could not remember when they last cried,\" the head of the independent research group said.\nLong gone is the \"No Tears -- We're British\" time when emotion was considered distinctly bad form. \"In our survey of 2,000 people, very few people in their forties or fifties had seen their father cry. Now it is twice as many,\" he told reporters. \"Seventy-seven percent of men considered crying in public increasingly acceptable.\" Almost half the British men opened the floodgatesover a sad movie, book or TV program. Self-pity got 17 percent crying. Nine percent cried at weddings.\nFrom the days of Empire, the British have always considered themselves models of reserve , laughing at \"excitable foreigners\" who show no self-control.\nMarsh argued the divide was still there: \"We have probably not caught up with the Americans or the Italians when it comes to the actual display of emotions.\"\n\"But we are clearly changing. What we take as typical British reserve has significantly faded \"\nWomen's battle for equal rights has certainly had an effect -- both in the workplace and at home. \"Men in their twenties or thirties are interacting  with women on equal terms much more than a generation ago. They have to relate to the opposite sex. Women become more man-like and men become more female. That transfers into the work place too,\" Marsh said.", "id": "high22023.txt"}
