He knew it was a long trip to where God lived, so he packed his suitcase with bread and a six-pack of beer and started on his journey.\nWhen he had gone about three blocks, he met an old woman. She was sitting in the park just staring at some pigeons. The boy sat down next to her and opened his suitcase. He was about to take a drink from his root beer when he noticed that the old lady looked hungry ,so he offered her a chunk of bread. She gratefully accepted it and smiled at him. Her smile was so pretty that the boy wanted to see it again, so he offered her some beer. Once again she smiled at him. The boy was delighted!\nThey sat there all afternoon eating and smiling, but they never said a word. As it began to grow dark, the boy realized how sad he was and he got up to leave. He turned around, ran back to the old woman and gave her a hug . She gave him her biggest smile ever.\nWhen the boy opened the door to his own house a short time later, his mother was surprised by the look of joy on his face. She asked him, \"What did you do today that made you so happy?\" He replied, \"I had lunch with God. You know what? She's got the most beautiful smile I've ever seen!\"\nMeanwhile, the old woman, also radiant   with joy, returned to her home. Her son was astonished by the look of joy on her face and he asked,\"Mother, what did you do today that made you so happy?\"She replied,\"I ate bread in the park with God. You know. He's much younger than I expected.\"", "id": "high18913.txt"}
