One day my new friend walked with me to my car. It was a very cold night. As we were walking to my car, a man walked up to us. Behind him was a woman pushing  _ with a child inside who was about 2 years old. The child had only a jacket on and it wasn'tzipped . The man began to tell us he wanted to borrow some money for the night and that he had a job but no place to live and was waiting for his first paycheck. He confirmed he could get our mailing address and mail the money back to us.\nThe guy I was with reached into his pocket to give this man a $20 bill. As the man was extending his hand out to take the money, I put my hand on my new friend's hand and said, \"Can I talk to you for a minute?\" I told him some people earned money by begging and that they always cheated those with soft hearts. And if they were truly worried about their child being out in the cold, they would have at least zipped his jacket.\nMy friend looked at me with disapproval and said, \"Michael, I know there are some people out there that take advantage of others. I also know some people out there that are one paycheck away from being homeless. If I gave $20 to 10 people and only one of them really needed it and used it for the right thing, it was worth it.\"\nI am now thirty-seven years old and have never forgotten what he said to me. I don't even remember his name now. But I do remember that this experience changed my perspective .", "id": "high22096.txt"}
