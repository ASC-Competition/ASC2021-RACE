My family and friends persuaded me that a holiday might be just what the doctor ordered, so off I went.\nArriving in the Sunshine State was not easy, but I managed to catch a taxi to the hotel. The next morning, I caught another taxi to do some shopping. Later I went to a cafe to buy some lunch, but having my sandwich and drink in my hands, I saw that all the tables were occupied  . Then I heard a friendly voice saying, \"You can share my table.\"\nI thankfully sat down with the smiling elderly lady and we shared a happy lunch together. As the meal drew to a close she asked how long I would be in Orlando. I had already told her that I hadn't hired   a car, and hadn't realized how costly taking taxis would be. After a while she said, \"My dear, don't use any more taxis. It would be my pleasure to drive you wherever you wish.\"\nI told her that I couldn't put her to that trouble, but she insisted. She took details of where I was staying and the next morning she drove me to Disney World. She took me through the park's gates and spent some time with me before leaving me to explore alone. At the end of the day, she returned to take me back to my hotel. The next few days, she drove me around Orlando's tourist areas. I offered her money but she refused to take any.\nWhen we had lunch on my last day, I thanked her for her kindness. I'll never forget that wonderful lady who filled my holiday in Florida with wonderful memories.", "id": "high13788.txt"}
