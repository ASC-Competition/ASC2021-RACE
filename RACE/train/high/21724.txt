However, Yale University researchers seem to disapprove of the old saying. They found how physically warm you are has a direct relation to ho how nice you are to people .\n   To test the theory the scientists carried out two studies involving a total of 94undergrauates.For the first they gave half the unwitting participants a glass of hot or cold coffee and then asked what they thought of a stranger after a brief meeting They found that holding a hot cup of coffee led people to judge the stranger to be a \"warmer \"person, in terms of generosity and kindness, compared to a group of people who held a cup of iced coffee.\n   In the second study the researchers had people , who thought they were evaluating a product, hold either hot pads  or cold pads. Then they give the participants a choice of reward for reward for participating in the study: either a gift for a friend, or a reward for themselves. They study found that people who held the hot pad were more likely to choose the gift for a friend, and people who help the cold pads were more likely to choose the reward for themselves.\n\"It appears that the effect of physical temperature is not just on how we see others, it affects our own behavior as well,\" said Professor John Bargh, a psychologist who carried out the study. \"Physical warmth can make us see others as warmer people, but also causes us to be warmer -more generous and trusting -as well.\"\nThe researchers believe the effect relates to childhood when emotional warmth given by a parent was often accompanied by the physical warmth of being held or hugged.", "id": "high21724.txt"}
