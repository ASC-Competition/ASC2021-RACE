The two tragedies provided a \"natural experiment\" for testing the idea, because the passengers on the two ships were quite similar in terms of gender   and wealth.\n   The major difference was how long it took the ships to sink. They suggested that when people have little time to react, instincts may rule. When more time is available, social influences play a bigger role. But psychologists  noted that many factors other than following social norms could come into play in a disaster, including an evolutionary urge to save the species, attachments  that are formed between individuals during the event and the leadership of authority figures.\nThe extent   of altruism   and how it occurs \"is a very controversial issue,\" said Anthony R. Mawson, a professor of preventive medicine at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.He thinks the dominant  response was attachment behavior.\n Psychologist Daniel Kruger of the University of Michigan, US thinks that the answer lies less in social norms and more in our evolutionary heritage. Human beings have a deep instinct to preserve our kind, he said, and that means \"people are more likely to save those who have higher reproductive value, namely the young and women in child-bearing years\".\n Kruger also stressed the importance of leadership during a disaster, noting that the Titanic's captain appeared to have greater control than the Lusitania's.", "id": "high20561.txt"}
