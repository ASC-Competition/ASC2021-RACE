The drive was an hour long, so we had plenty of time to chat. We were waiting to get onto the freeway when my daughter Hayley noticed a homeless man, no sign in hand. \"Mom, is that man homeless?\" I told her I believed he was.\nWe got onto the freeway and drove away. But the chatting had stopped. Hayley was quiet all the way there. We spent a few hours at Grandma's then packed up to head home. As we drove back, Hayley rustled  around in her seat, trying to reach something on the floor of the car. I asked her to sit still, worried her seatbelt would slip from the booster seat. She mumbled something and sat back.\n\"Mom, will the homeless man still be outside tonight?\" I told her I was not sure, maybe. It was a freezing night, and I started to think of the man now too, and how cold he must be.\nAll of a sudden, as we got onto the freeway exit, Haley shrieked  : \"There he is! There he is!\" and started rolling down her window. \"Mom, I found these gloves and scarf back here. Can I give them to him? Can I?\" she asked.\nI pulled over to the edge of the road, and beckoned  the man to come over. Haley smiled at him and handed him her gift. I looked in the front passenger seat, loaded with leftovers from Grandma's house, and handed those out to him as well.\nThe man thanked us, he clutched   my hand in his and I could feel the bitter cold of them. We wished him a safe night and continued on our journey to our warm home.\n\"Haley, that was very sweet of you!\" I told her. \"Well, they were your gloves and scarf, Mom, but his hands looked colder, and he has to keep looking for his house!\"\nWe had talked about homelessness before , and I could hear myself telling her: \"Someone who has lost their home.\" She had taken my words literally and thought the man's home was like a lost puppy.\nOn the ride home, and as I carried my sleeping angel into the house that night, my heart filled with gratitude.", "id": "high3871.txt"}
