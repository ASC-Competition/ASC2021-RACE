Now some researchers are trying to figure out how to get robots to do it, by looking at the behavior of squirrels and birds.\nAt Georgia Tech, a team led by Ronald Arkin , a professor at the School of interactive Computing, studied the literature on squirrels hiding their acorns  .Squirrels will hide their food m a certain place, but when they see other squirrels trying to steal from them, they attempt to fool the thieves by running to a fake location.\nRonald Arkin and his Ph. D. student Jaeeun Shim used that as a model for robot behavior. They programmed the robot into tricking a \"predator  \" machine by doing what ei squirrel does: showing the enemy a false location for an important resource.\nThe team also looked at how other animals in this case,a species of bird called Arabian babbler~ drive off predators. A babbler will make an alarm call when they see a predator and other babblers will join the bird and make more calls. They then surround the predator, all the while flapping  wings and making noises. The babblers don't ever actually fight the animal they want to drive off; they just make enough noises and flaps around enough so that it seems that attacking a babbler isn't worth it\nThey found that the deception works when the group reaches a certain size--essentially, when enough birds arrive to convince the enemy that it's best to back off . Davis modeled that behavior in software using a military scene and found that it worked even if the group didn't have the firepower to confront the enemy directly.\nThe military is interested in this because a robot that can fool an opponent is a valuable tool. It could lead an enemy down a fake trail or make itself look more dangerous than it actually is.", "id": "high3059.txt"}
