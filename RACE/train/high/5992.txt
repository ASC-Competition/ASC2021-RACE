At the beginning of the meal, a friend told us that his car had just been broken into and his briefcase   had been stolen. He was frustrated   because his diary and a number of other items important to him were in the briefcase. He said he could remember only four items that were in his stolen briefcase, that he knew there were many more, that he had to give a full report to the police within two hours, and that the more he tried to remember the more blocked he became.\nSeveral of us at the table who were familiar with Memory Principles   then took him through the following exercise; instead of continuing to allow him to think of what he could not remember, we asked him when he had last had his briefcase open. It turned out that it was at the office just before he left work, at which point he suddenly remembered that he had put two important magazine articles in the briefcase. We then asked him when he had last had the briefcase open before leaving home for work. It turned out to have been the night before, and he remembered having put in two more articles as well as a tape recorder, in preparation for the following morning. Finally we asked him to describe the inner   design of his briefcase, and as he went through a detailed description, he remembered pens, pencils, letters and a number of other items that he had completely \"forgotten\" before.\nWithin 20 minutes, he remembered 18 additional items. The secret is to \"forget about\" whatever you are trying to remember and \" _ \" all experiences that connect in any way with the item you are trying to remember. This method works at once almost in all cases, and takes the form of a created Mind Map around the \"missing\" center.\nThis memory method, like the others, improves your memory as well as your creativity, and in addition gives you confidence when you realize that, no matter what you have forgotten, there is still a chance to solve any memory mystery  !", "id": "high5992.txt"}
