As they wanted to stay on good terms with the landowner, they offered to blow up a large tree  _ that had remained after part of a tree had been blown down in the storm. But Lord Hunt asked them not to damage the plantation of young trees that was next to the stump. The officer in charge of the engineers promised him that they would be careful. Lord Hunt was so pleased that he asked the whole group to lunch on the day of the explosion.\nThe day came and just before lunch, the officer checked with one of his men to see if they had put enough explosive in the stump. \"I checked the maths,\" said the soldier \"and it comes to 32 kilos.\" \"Are you sure?\" asked the officer. \"Perhaps you'd better put in a bit more just to make sure.\" The lunch continued and everyone ate a lot and drank a lot.\nA little later, the group of soldiers went outside with Lord Hunt to see the explosion. \"You just see, Lord Hunt, that tree will fall in exactly the right place without hurting any of your young trees,\" said the officer. The soldier lit the fuse, then walked quickly away to take cover. After a minute the tree, instead of falling over on its side, rose with the explosion 20 metres into the air, taking with it a huge quantity of earth together with all the young plantation. \"Sorry sir, I made a mistake!\" said the soldier. \"It should have been 3.2 kilos, not 32 kilos.\"\nLord Hunt was so upset that he turned around and walked back to his house. He looked at the house in horror and saw that every single window had been broken by the explosion. He was so upset that he went to the toilet on the ground floor to get over his feelings of shock. When he had finished, he pulled the plug of the toilet and the whole ceiling, which had been weakened by the explosion, fell on his head.", "id": "high23893.txt"}
