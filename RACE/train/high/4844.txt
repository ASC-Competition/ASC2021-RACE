There is an empty feeling that I have had so many times before and it seems to be coming back into my mind. What is it? I can't figure it out.\nI got ready for work. On the way I decide to stop and get a cheese from the little shop just down the road. I have never been there before but I was hungry and it would be 5 hours before I got off work.\nThe owner of the store took my order. He asked me what I wanted and I told him I heard he made a great cheese. He seemed pleased to hear that.\nAs I was sitting in the small space,there was an elderly gentleman finishing his breakfast. He paid the waitress, received this change and made a small joke. As he turned to get up, which was quite a difficult feat for this gentleman, he looked over at me. I gave a small smile.\nHe looked again in my direction for a moment and said to me, \"Has anyone ever told you, you have the most beautiful brown eyes?\"\nSeeing as I have blue eyes, I can't say I have ever heard that before. I humored him and said, \"No, I can't say anyone has ever told me that before.\"\nHe smiled, and said,\"Well since they are blue you wouldn't have heard that, but you have beautiful blue eyes.\"\nI laughed and said thank you very much. He began to tell me a few one liner jokes so I smiled and laughed at his jokes.\nHe tried to get up to leave again and looked at me and said\"Your smile really brightens a room, do you know that?\"I said,\"Thank you very much.\"\nHe proceeded to get up, which took him quite some time. As he got up he said,\"Take care of that smile.\"\nI felt a sense of comfort wash over me and I reflected on my morning and that empty feeling I had. For a moment in time it seemed to be filled.", "id": "high4844.txt"}
