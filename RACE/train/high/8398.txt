The new newspaper was conceived   by Cambridge University scientists. They came up with the idea of replacing silicon chips       with plastic ones. it is  being developed by Plastic Logic, a company based in Dresden, Germany.\n\"It looks just like a table mat, and is as light as a magazine. But you can download hundreds of  newspapers at the touch of a button, and read them quite safely,\" the BBC reported on its website.\nThe plastic paper is produced in a safe \"clean room\" at the Plastic Logic factory, which opened last month as the world's first plastic-electronics factory. Every part of the product, from the screen to the  electronics, is made of plastic. And it is described by engineer Dean Baker as \"top quality\". Baker says the plastic newspaper could help solve the problem of waste material associated with traditlional newspapers.\n\"There's a huge amount of waste . We have paper distributed     all over the country each day and then thrown into the bin. This doesn't need to happen any more. All of the copies could be made electronically and stored on a single e-reader with the appearance of paper.\" he says.\nPeople can expect to see the plastic newspaper next year, the BBC says.", "id": "high8398.txt"}
