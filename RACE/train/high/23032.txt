Most of them have never been in the countryside, and have spent the past week feeding cows and going for long winter walks.\nThey are here on Jamie's Farm. Started by Feilden, it aims to give inner-city children the experience of rural life. The children, many of whom have been in gangs  or in trouble with the police, stay for a week in the Feildens' family home. According to Feilden, not a single item has been lost, stolen or broken in the farm. As his mother says, \"I think the beauty here helps them.\" Or as 16-year-old Daniel says, \"I like to be here. It smells all fresh.\"\nThe pupils rise early to feed the cows, ping, chickens and horses, before eating a cooked breakfast. Following this comes more farm work, lunch, more work, a long walk, supper and finally bed. They love it. \"It is great not having a phone,\" explains one. \"I focus so much better.\" Many speak of how the diet has changed their mood and others of how much they like feeding the animals.\nThe idea for the farm came when Feilden was working as a teacher in a \"challenging\" Croydon school. Most of the pupils had never been beyond the town, let alone into the countryside. Feilden felt farming could help. \"It gave the pupils something to do besides fighting.\" It is, of course, not a  _ -- a troubled child will still be a troubled child -- but Feilden says it still worthwhile. \"If all we achieve is to show them the beauty of the countryside, then I think we've achieved a lot.\"", "id": "high23032.txt"}
