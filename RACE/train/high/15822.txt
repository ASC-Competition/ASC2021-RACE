The animal had a large mouse like head and jumped along on its large legs. To his great surprise, the unusual animal carried its young in a special pocket of flesh. Captain Cook pointed to the animal which was eating grass in the distance and asked his native guide what the animal was referred to. The guide seemed not to know that he was pointing at and finally said \"Kang-a-roo\", but their requests were met with puzzled looks of the native people. Before long they got to discover that the native guide who made the answer to Cook's question really meant, \"I don't know what you pointing at. \" Funny enough, the name \" Kang-a-roo\", stuck and it is still in use today.", "id": "high15822.txt"}
