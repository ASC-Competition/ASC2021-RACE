They do so by running their fingers along a line of raised points or dots on paper. Of course, they first have to learn the code. Here are some examples of it. One dot stands for the letter \"A.\" Two dots side by side mean \"C.\" Four dots arranged to look like a box (: :) stand for the letter \"G.\" By placing the dots in special patterns, all the letters of the alphabet can be formed.\nThis code was made up by a Frenchman called Louis Braille. Though he could see at birth, he became sightless when he was only three. Braille was cutting leather in his father's shop. His knife slipped and cut his eye. Infection spread to both eyes, and he became blind.\nAt 10, he was placed in a home for the blind. But young Louis had great talent. He became a skilled musician and soon got a job as a church organist  in Paris.\nBecause he had talent and was quick, he became a teacher at a school for the blind. While there, he heard that an army captain had sent messages to his gun crews so they could read them at night without light. His messages were in the simple form of raised dots and dashes. This was the clue Louis needed. At the age of 15, he worked out his own six-dot code. Each group of dots is called a cell. The cells are three dots high and two dots wide. For the rest of his life, Braille taught his young flock to read both written and musical works using his code. \nFor the last 17 years of his life, Braille was ill with tuberculosis . He died at the age of 43. France honored him by placing his remains in the famous Pantheon in Paris.", "id": "high18462.txt"}
