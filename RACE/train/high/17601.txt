It was only a month before Christmas, starting to get cold and I could not help thinking about him.\nSo I bought a brush, pack of cigarettes, cans of fish, and then I added a blanket and sweatshirts. I made a box up like a present and went in search of this man. I saw him hobble   away from the dustbin. I pulled over, took the box and went up to him. I said, \"I would like to give you a Christmas present, there are some food items in here and some things you might be able to use.\"\nHe sidestepped around me and said, \"No, thank you. I just had lunch. I don't need anything.\" Then he hobbled on down the sidewalk, leaving me standing there in tears. I took the box down to a little shop that gave things out to the poor and homeless and told them what had happened and asked them to give the box to someone who could use it. The person there told me not to be upset and let my feelings be hurt as I was still crying. I told her I was not crying for me but for him because what I had done took away his dignity by treating him like a person in need. I was so ashamed.\nA few years later I was able to volunteer in St. Anthony's Dining Room in San Francisco. These people had to stand in line for up to 6 hours to receive the only food they will get. We took one tray   of food at a time, and treated them as if they were in a restaurant ordering a meal they were paying for. \nFrom this I learned a great lesson. Accepting help is sometimes harder than giving it.", "id": "high17601.txt"}
