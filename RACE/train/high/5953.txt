The policy was recently relaxed, allowing couples to have two children if one of them is an only child.\nThose who break the policy face severe fines. The amount of the fine is generally several times the yearly annual income of the two spouses . Some media calculations put the fine that Zhang may face at as much as 160 million yuan(over $26 million).\nZhang's birth case has caused criticism online about famous people who have more children than the policy allows.\nIn an open letter on December 1, Zhang admitted that the couple has two sons and daughter and they are willing to accept investigation and punishment according to China's laws and regulations. He apologized to the public.\nHowever, the letter denied that Zhang had lovers and was father to as many as seven children from various mothers.\nZhang, one of the \"fifth generation\" of Chinese filmmakers, made his first directorial work in 1987 with \"Red Sorghum\" and has won a number of award worldwide. He was chief director of the opening and closing ceremonies of the Beijing Olympic Games.", "id": "high5953.txt"}
