Have been since I was a teen. Mother worked for the continuing education department of a university, and they were offering a class on speed reading and needed one more person to fill out the class. I became that one person.\nThe class met for only an hour or two for a few weeks, but when the goal of a class is speed, you don't need to meet for long. The instructor said to make our eyes go across the lines of words as fast as they could and not to be concerned about what the words meant. I read Animal Farm in 10 ten minutes. Cover to cover. The instructor asked what the book was about. I said I didn't know, but if I had to guess I'd say it was about animals on a farm. He looked displeased.\nI've been speed reading ever since. I can't stop and I can't slow down. Today, for example, I plan on reading Churchill's History of the English Speaking Peoples over lunch. I hope it's more memorable than Animal Farm.\nAs a result of all this speed-reading, I often experience a delay between what I think I read and what something actually says.\nThe other day I passed by a mall with a large sign that said \"Auto Theft Sale\". I thought how efficient it was for auto thieves to simply sell all the stole cars in a big tent at the mall. A half-mile later it dawned on me that the sign had said \"Auto Tent Sale\".\nEvery time I drive through a construction zone, I gasp  . The sign says: \"Hit a Worker $10, 000 (about 62,000 yuan).\" It reads like they're offering a reward. Of course, it's not an offer. It's just that my eyes rarely take in the last line that says, \"Fine.\" It's a $10, 000 fine if you hit a worker. Someone really needs to rephrase that one.\nSpeed reading has bitten me on the backside more than once. Especially as a writer. Just ask any of my editors.", "id": "high19097.txt"}
