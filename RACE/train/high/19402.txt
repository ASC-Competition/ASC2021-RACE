He has been a plane model fan since childhood. As a freshman, he spent two nights building a model aircraft and took it to the sports field just for fun. Wu Junqi, the coach of Shanghai Jiaotong University's Aero-Sport Club, spotted Wang and told him his model was outdated.\n \"I was a little angry, so he took me to the lab,\" says Wang. He was immediately drawn to the modern equipment and decided to join the club. As a technology fan, Wang spends most of his spare time in the lab. \"He loves what he's doing, so he can stand the loneliness of doing research that others seldom have the persistence to carry out.\" says coach Wu. \nWhen Wang and his teammates were building UAV, they lived together in the lab. \"We tried to spend as much time together as possible because there were thousands of problems that needed to be solved.\"  Wang says. They didn't even have time to celebrate when the first test flight of the UAV went well. \"We needed to list the problems that occurred during the flight and analyze them to find solutions.\" he says.\n\"Our UAV isn't finished yet, but there are many design projects and people with similar interests waiting for me.\"  Wang says. \"The UAV is just the beginning, not the end of my aircraft journey.\"", "id": "high19402.txt"}
