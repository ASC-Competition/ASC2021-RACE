The book, which is due to be published next year, uncovers evidence that there's a link between Da Vinci and the Far Fast.\nSpeaking to the South China Morning http://w|ww?.wln%100.com @Post, Mr. Paratico said, \"I am sure that Leonardo's mother was from the East, but to make her a Chinese, we need to use a deductive method  .\nOne wealthy client of Leonardo's father had a slave called Caterina. After Leonardo's date of birth, she disappeared from the documents. She was no longer working there.\"\nIt is believed that his mother was called Caterina, who, according to some reports, was a local peasant. But Mr. Paratico's new work claims it is most likely that Da Vinci's mother was a slave.\nSupporting his theory, he said, \"During the Renaissance, countries like Italy and Spain were full of slaves from the East.\"\nHe claimed that there were certain aspects of Da Vinci's life and works which suggest a Chinese link. For instance, he was writing with his left hand from left to right and he was also a vegetarian, which was not common. Mona Lisa is probably a portrait of his mother, as Sigmund Freud said in 1910. On the back of Mona Lisa, there is a Chinese landscape and even her face looks Chinese.\nMr. Paratico said he believes the only way to solve the mystery is to dig out some of Da Vinci's relations in Florence and extract some DNA.", "id": "high19410.txt"}
