The storm affected more than 12 million people in India and neighboring countries, and damaged or destroyed many houses. However, good news is that cleverly-designed beach house created by architect Ray Huff can survive such strong winds and storm waves.\nLocated on the shore of an Indian island, Huff's award-winning cube-shaped beach house was built to replace one smashed to pieces by Hurricane Phailin.\nHuff pointed out that many houses built along shoreline were poorly constructed, and enforcement  of building codes wasn't strict. After Phailin's attack, all new shoreline houses are required to meet stricter, better-enforced codes. The new beach house should be able to stand a Category 3 hurricane with peak winds of 179 to 209 kilometers per hour.\nAt first sight, Huff's house looks anything but hurricane-proof. Its redwood shell makes it resemble \"a large party lantern\" at night, according to one observer. But looks can be misleading. The house's wooden frame is reinforced  with long steel rods to give it extra strength.\nTo further protect the house from hurricane damage _ Huff raised it 2.7 meters off the ground on pilings---long columns of wood anchored  deep in the sand. Pilings might appear insecure, but they are strong enough to support the weight of the house. They also balance the house above storm waves. The pilings allow the waves to run under the house instead of running into it. \"These swells of water come ashore at great speeds and cause most of the damage done to beach-front buildings,\" said Huff.\nHuff designed the wooden pilings to be partially hidden by the house's ground-to-roof shell. \"The shell masks the pilings so that the house doesn't look like it's standing with its pant legs pulled up,\" said Huff. In case of a storm wave, the shell should break apart and let the waves rush under the house, the architect explained.", "id": "high5888.txt"}
