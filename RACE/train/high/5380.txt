Looking out to the sea carefully, he saw a couple of kids in a rowboat were being pulled out to sea.\nTwo 12-year-old boys, Christian and Jack, rowed out a boat to search for a football. Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters, a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water. The pair panicked and tried to row back to shore. But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control.\nTim knew it would soon be swallowed by the waves. \"Everything went quiet in my head,\" Tim recalls . \"I was trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.\"\nTim took off his clothes and jumped into the water. Every 500 yards or so, he raised his head to judge his progress. \"At one point, I considered turning back,\" he says. \"I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.\" After 30 minutes of struggling, he was close enough to yell to the boys, \"Take down the umbrella!\"\nChristian made much effort to take down the umbrella. Then Tim was able to catch up and climb aboard the boat. He took over rowing, but the waves were almost too strong for him.\n\"Let's aim for the pier ,\" Jack said. Tim turned the boat toward it.

Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs. Tim swan toward land as water washed over the boys' faces.\n\"Are we almost there?\" they asked again and again. \"Yes,\" Tim told them each time.\nAfter 30minutes, they reached the pier.", "id": "high5380.txt"}
