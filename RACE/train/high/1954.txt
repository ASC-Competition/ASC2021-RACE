Lifting two grocery bags, he followed her across the yard and stood on the step of her house. Glancing up, he saw a large wasp nest under the roof. Allen had heard that wasps can become more likely to sting(sting, stung, stung)in summer. He mentioned this to Mrs. Carey, who had opened the door.\n\"Oh, they don't bother me,\" she said lightly. \"I go in and out all the time.\"\nAnxiously, Allen looked at the nest again-to see the wasps flying straight at him. \"Hurry!\" he shouted to Mrs. Carey. \"Get in!\"\nShe stepped quickly inside. Allen ran for his mini-bus. Too late; they were upon him. Just as he jumped aboard, half a dozen red spots showed on his arm, and he felt more on his back and shoulders.\nAs he was driving down the road, Allen felt as if something was burning at the back of his neck, and the \"fire\" was spreading forward toward his face. An immediate anxiety took hold of him. Allen knew that stings could cause some persons to die. But he had been stung the previous summer and the after-effects soon passed. However, what he didn't know was that the first sting had turned his body into a time bomb waiting for the next to set off an explosion.\nMiles from the nearest medical assistance, Allen began to feel his tongue thick and heavy and his heartbeat louder. Most frightening, he felt his breathing more and more difficult. He reached for the radio mike ,trying to call the mini-bus center, but his words were hardly understandable. Signals were also poor that far out. He knew a rescue team was on 24-hour duty at the Amherst Fire Department's north station. So his best chance was to make a run for it.\nRushing down the mountain, Allen tried not to panic, focusing his mind on each sharp turn. He was almost through the last of them when he felt sure he was going into shock .Just then he reached for the radio mike again.\n\"Call fire station,\" he shouted, concentrating to form the words. \"Emergency. Bee sting. Emergency. There in ten minutes.\"\n\"Five-ten,\" the center replied.\nHold on, Allen thought. Keep your eyes open. Breathe. Keep awake.\nAt last he reached the station. Two firemen ran out. Allen felt their hands grasp him before he hit the ground. You made it, he thought.", "id": "high1954.txt"}
