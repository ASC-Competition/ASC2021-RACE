Shortly afterwards, fellow officer Ken Knapcik, a 20-year veteran   of the force, returned home after work to find a note from his 15-year-old daughter on the dining table.\nDad---This poem came directly from my heart. I love you so much! It scares and amazes me that you go out every day and risk everything to provide us with all that we have. I wrote this to express how much I love you and how much lost I'd be without you-Laura. P.S.: Hey, let's be careful out there.\nTitled \"The Ultimate Cop\", Laura's poem was dedicated \"To all the cops in the world who have daughters who love them with all their hearts. And especially to my dad.\" It was about a police-officer's daughter who sees on the night time news that her father has been shot. Part of poem: \"Daddy, my Daddy, can you hear me cry? Oh, God, I need my Daddy, please don't let him die.\"\nKen Knapcik stood alone as he read the poem. \"It took me several minutes,\" he said. \"I'd get through part of it and have to stop before I could go on. I was weeping. She had never told me she was scared.\" He took the poem to work the next day and showed it to his fellow officers. \"I've never seen so many grown men cry. Some couldn't finish it.\"\nKnapcik keeps Laura's poem in the pocket of his police jacket. He takes it with him every time he leaves the house for a new shift. \"I don't want to be out there without it.\" he said, \"I'll probably carry it with me forever.\"", "id": "high1999.txt"}
