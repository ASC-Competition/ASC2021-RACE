Probably thousands of people have already been using it, but I just discovered it, so I'm going to claim it and also name it: Fake Foning.\nThe technology has been working well for me at the office, but there are infinite  applications. Virtually in any public space.\nSay you work at a big university with lots of talky faculty members buzzing about. Now, say you need to use the restroom. The trip down the hall will take approximately one hour, because a person can't walk into those talky people without getting pulled aside for a question, a bit of gossip, a new read on a certain line of Paradise Lost.\nSo, a cellphone.

I was trying to buy myself some time, so I continued fake foning with my doctor. \"So I don't need the operation? Oh, doctor, that is the best news.\"\nAnd then: Brrrrrrng! Brrrrrmg! Brrrrrmg! My phone started ringing, right there while it was planted on my face. My colleague looked at me, and I at him, and naturally I gasped. \"What is the matter with this thing?\" I said, pulling the phone away to look at it, and then putting it back to my ear.\n\"Hello? Are you still there?\"  Oops.", "id": "high2961.txt"}
