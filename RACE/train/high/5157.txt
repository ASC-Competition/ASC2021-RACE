What could be more natural than sitting around a beautiful fire on a winter night, at a campsite in the Berkshires?\nHard as it may be to believe, the fireplace--long considered a trophy , particularly in a city like New York--is acquiring a social shame. Among those who desire to be environmentally responsible, it is joining the ranks of bottled water and big houses.\nSally Treadwell, a 51-year-old public relations executive in Boone, N.C., said nothing makes her happier than building a fire on a cold winter night. But most of the time she doesn't, because she feels too guilty about the damage it may do to the environment. Every time she builds a fire, it causes \" _ ,\" she said. \"It's a guilty pleasure\".\n\"The smoke from a fire smells very nice,\" said Diane Bailey, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco. \"But it can cause a lot of harm. The tiny particles  can cause illness, and can cross into the bloodstream, causing heart attacks as well as worsening other conditions.\"\nGrowing concerns about the air pollution and health problems caused by smoke from wood fires are urging a number of areas across the country to pass laws regulating them.

It also reports that approximately 35,000 fireplaces were installed in the United States in 2009, compared to 80,000 in 2005.
