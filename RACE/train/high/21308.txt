Scientists have shown that eggs produce proteins with a function similar to that of powerful blood pressure-lowering drugs.\nThe research, from the University of Alberta in Canada, showed that when eggs come in contact with stomach enzymes   they produce a protein that acts in the same way as  _ , but more work is needed to show the effects outside a lab and in the human body.\nEarlier this month, British researchers declared that, contrary to popular beliefs, it is healthy to go to work on an egg.They concluded that the type of cholesterol   found in eggs has little effect on increasing heart disease risks.\nResearcher Professor Bruce Griffin, from the University of Surrey, said: \"The wrong beliefs linking egg eating to high blood cholesterol and heart disease must be corrected.The amount of fat in our diet has an effect on blood cholesterol that is several times greater than the  ly small amounts of cholesterol found in eggs.The UK public do not need to be limiting the number of eggs they eat.They can be encouraged to include them in a healthy diet as they are one of nature's most nutritious foods.\"\nThe British Heart Foundation dropped its three-egg-a-week limit in 2005.However, almost half of Britons believe the limit still applies.", "id": "high21308.txt"}
