Whether it was a play, or even just a practice---my parents were always there for me. As an only child, they _ everything in my life.\nLesson2---Hide in the bathroom\nFor years I wondered why my mother had made the bathroom her own personal library and would stay there forever. Now I know it's the only place for her to have at least two minutes of peace and quiet. Well, I try to, but that's quite difficult with two cats, a dog, a kid, a husband and only one bathroom.\nLesson3---Get involved \nI was lucky in having parents who let me do anything they think was good. Now today, I am fond of being active and involved. Whether it is a sports game or a volunteering group, or just playing with my daughter, I love to be involved.\nLesson4---It's OK to fail\nMy parents weren't perfect and that was OK. I know I'm not perfect and I hope my daughter knows that's OK. Families love one another no matter what happens. If you fail, you learn from the mistakes and keep right on going.\nParents are so important to a child's growth and development and I'm so glad that I had great parents to follow.", "id": "high8528.txt"}
