We were both hungry and wanted to grab a quick bite on our way there, so we swung through a Jack-In-the-Box- Drive-thru Restaurant and placed our order.\nWhen we got up to the window the lady smiled at me, which is sometimes rare and asked how I was doing while she was collecting our money for the food. I replied, \"Fine, and how are you'?\"She went to get our order ready and I asked my husband to pass my \"Drive-thru Smile bag\" to me. He handed it to me and watched in amazement as I gathered together a \"You make a difference\" paper, including a smile card, a smile stamp and a smile button.\nShe came back to the window almost before I finished putting it all together. Without looking too closely she passed the bag and said, \"Thank you. Have a good day.\" I said, \"Wait! This is for you.\" As I placed the little smile gifts in her hand a smile spread across her face. As she looked at the items it got a little bigger but when I thanked her for her smile there was no holding back. She gave the biggest smile and she was laughing. It was very heartwarming.\nMy husband was very impressed by it. It made him smile too. It just takes a little effort to connect in a human way to everyone we have dealings with, even with something as small as a Drive-thru transaction.\nRemember, we all make a difference!", "id": "high19965.txt"}
