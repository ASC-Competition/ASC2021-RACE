But we knew he loved us... he just had his own way of showing it.\nWhen I was a teen, we were seasonal campers at a family campground almost an hour outside the city where we lived. Each family had their own campsite with water and electric, and you basically parked your camper there from May through October. Most \"Seasonals\" visited them every weekend during those months, with the occasional weeklong stay. There were plenty of other kids who camped seasonally each weekend, and they came to be some of my closest friends. Of course, many of them were boys.\nWe kids paired up with our little boyfriends or girlfriends, and we'd hold hands as we'd walk around the campground. We'd play ping-pong, have some snacks, and play songs. Most weekends were pretty similar, but the couples would change. You'd see so-and-so with a different so-and-so than they were with the weekend before. You know how it is when you're a teen -- a three-week relationship is a really long time.\nSo, needless to say, my teen years were spent with quite a few different boys. But every single one of them had something in common... they'd all received The Evil Eye.\nThe Evil Eye was a magical sort of thing. One simple look from my dad, and the boy immediately knew not to _ me. It was as if he could send his warnings through invisible laser beams that shot directly from his eyes to the boys' brains.\n\"You will not put your hands on my daughter... You will not kiss my daughter... You will not even whisper sweet nothings into my daughter's ear.\"\nI remember one night in particular, walking with a boy around the campground after dark. We came from one direction, and my dad from the other. The boy and my dad locked eyes for a brief second, then the boy dropped my hand like a hot potato and turned away, giving me a quick, \"See ya later.\"\nYes, the Evil Eye. Best way ever to keep wandering teen boy hands away from your daughters.", "id": "high11912.txt"}
