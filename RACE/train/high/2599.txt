It is _ so regularly. Instead of streets winding and twisting   as they do in London, they are all regular and well planned. The streets running north and south are called \"avenues\" and are numbered, e.g. 1stAvenue, 2ndAvenue, etc. The streets going east and west are called \"streets\" and are also numbered, e.g. 51stStreet, 63rdStreet. It is all much more logical   than London's street names. But I couldn't help thinking how much more interesting than these dull cold numbers are London's illogical but colorful names of streets, e.g. \"Bishopgate\" (which is not a gate and hasn't a Bishop in it); \"Haymarket\" or \"Corn market\" (where you won't see any hey or corn) or \"Poultry\" (without a living chicken anywhere in sight) or \"Thread needle Street\" (where you won't find little girls learning to sew).", "id": "high2599.txt"}
