But little Aidan Sullivan -- who was born with a facial defect and no right ear -- yesterday put up a brave front, with a message for the crook(thief): \"I'm going to kick your butt!\"\n\"I want to look normal,\" said Aidan, whose father, Tim, is a firefighter in the Bronx. The third-grader has hemi facial micro soma, in which one half of the face doesn't develop correctly.\nLast weekend, family friend Peter Drake, a Ridgefield, Conn., firefighter, hosted a fund-raiser, collecting between $8,000 and $9,000. But when the party at a Danbury, Conn., Irish cultural center was over, the money had disappeared.\n\"At the end of the night, all the money that was donated was put in a zippered bag,\" said Tim Sullivan. \"A bartender gave the bag to Pete... He had it in his hands. He put it down to go do something, and when he came back, he saw that it was missing.\"\nSullivan said his longtime friend -- who has had fund-raisers to pay for Aidan's 10 previous surgeries -- is \"devastated.\"\n\"Pete was so upset. He kept saying, 'I let Aidan down, I let Aidan down,\" Colleen Sullivan, 40, recalled.\n\"We even went Dumpster diving, in case it was thrown out.\"\nThe Sullivans plan to go ahead with the March 1 surgery led by specialists at NYU's Langone Medical Center in Manhattan. The money would have offset the $10,000 to $15,000 that insurance doesn't cover. Yesterday, Aidan said he's not a fan of hospitals and doesn't like to be away from his sister, Kaylee, 4. But he's willing to do it. \"I'm excited,\" he said. \"Finally, an ear.\"", "id": "high4965.txt"}
