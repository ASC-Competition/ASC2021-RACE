Describing the situation, Kellyanne said:\"I noticed she fell onto some glass, and when she got up, I spotted a big wound starting at the thumb and finishing at the ring finger. I started applying pressure to the bleeding wound at once and sent someone to bring my first-aid box from my house.\"\nShe continued: \"I phoned for an ambulance and gave the lady every last detail that she wanted to know. I got another person to keep an eye out for the ambulance. The young girl was in great pain so she couldn't stay still. I was scared she was not going to respond to me. I held her hand above the heart so that the bleeding could at least stop a little bit.\"\n\"Once the person came back with the bandage, the ambulance was there. The nurse got me to hold a flashlight for her while she bandaged the wound. Once the girl was all bandaged up, I helped her onto the seat in the ambulance and she was taken to hospital.\"\nMargaret Pridgen, the British Red Cross trainer who had been teaching Kellyanne, was full of praise for her swift action. She said:\"I think this is quite an achievement for this young girl, I have really seen her confidence grow during the training and am delighted she had the poise to be able to deal with the situation and put her new skills into practice.\"", "id": "high8074.txt"}
