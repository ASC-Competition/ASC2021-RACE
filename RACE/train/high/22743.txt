In these schools, students are often told to turn off their video games and get some exercise. The schools have found a new way for their students to work out while playing a new video game. West Virginiais one of the heaviest states in the country. About half of its fifth-graders are considered to be overweight, and their parents are worried about that. To get them moving on a healthier path, the state's public schools are using a video game called \"Dance Dance Revolution\".\n   To use the game, players should stand on a special mat in front of a TV screen. Following arrows on the screen, players must move their feet to the specific symbols on the mat. Players must move quickly, touching symbols on the mat at just the right time. With each song, they get more exercise.\n   \"It we can get children to change their behavior at a young age, they will hopefully grow up to be healthy and active adults,\" said Carl Callison of Mountain State Blue Cross, a health care company.\n    West Virginiais ranked among the top three heaviest states. About a third of West Virginians are considred to be obese. Even more are considered to be overweight. Extra weight can lead to serious health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, some cancers, and many other health issues.\n   \"One out of three children born in West Virginia today will have diabetes by the time they grow up,\" said Nidia Henderson, a manager for the public employees' insurance  program. \"That's a terrible thing and not acceptable.\"\n   All ofWest Virginia's 157 middle schools are using the video game. School officials hope that all public schools in the state will use the game within the next three years. However, officials emphasize that the game is not meant to _ physical education and health classes. The game will be part of physical education classes and after-school programs.", "id": "high22743.txt"}
