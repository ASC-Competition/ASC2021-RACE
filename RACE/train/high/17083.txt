Further education is not for me. I want to be out seeing the world in the army. My mum and dad say they will cut me off and have nothing to do with me if I go into the military. They have other plans for me. My friends all laugh at me and say I won't ever get on. I know I am not the fittest guy in the world but I thought that would come with the training. I am now asking myself if I should just give up my lifelong ambitions and get the sort of job my parents approve of. I don't want to look back with regrets but sometimes I think maybe they are right and know more than me.\nSamson\nDear Samson, \nIt's your life and your future.\nYour parents mean well, and may be fearful of what could happen to you if you are posted to a danger zone, but you must decide this by yourself.\nAt least talk to an army recruitment office about what is involved and about how fit you need to be. Do your research. Find out everything you can about what choices you will have. Then go for it. Start a sensible eating and exercise plan right away. If you are motivated you can get reasonably fit in a few weeks. Tell your parents and friends you want to give it a try. If you still feel it's right for you, then apply. If it isn't for you, at least you won't regret for the rest of your life. Parents and friends may say, \"I told you so\", but you will know that you've followed your dream and made up your own mind about the sort of career for you.\nTalk to At East which is an independent and confidential organization providing advice and support for those who are in the military and those who would like to be. They can explain when you are allowed to leave and how much attention you have to give.\nDeidre", "id": "high17083.txt"}
