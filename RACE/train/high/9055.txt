He was 17 and he had an aging disease known as progeria.\n\"Even though I have many difficulties in my life, I don't want people to feel bad for me,\" Sam said during a TED talk.\nProgeria affects approximately one in every 4 million to 8 million newborns. Right now, there are only about 200 children living with it worldwide. The genetic  change tied to _ causes those with the disease to produce the protein progerin, which blocks normal cell function.\nHis view on life is extremely inspiring. He had to face challenges no one else could even dream of. As children with progeria age rapidly, they suffer from a loss of body fat and hair and an inability to gain weight. That didn't keep Sam down, though.\n\"All in all, I don't waste energy feeling bad for myself,\" Sam said. \"I surround myself with people that I want to be with. And I keep moving forward.\"\nThis boy from Boston was so amazing, famous people and athletes wanted to take him under their own. Last Saturday night could have been an amazing moment for Sam. One of his favorite teams, the New England Patriots, wanted to make him their honorary captain during a playoff game.\nInstead, it just was't meant to be. Sam passed away before he had a chance to stand next to his team, so they held a moment of silence before the game for him.\nSam's unbelievable view on life, and his deep effect on others, is hard to forget. He was presented with so many challenges in life but he wasn't afraid to face them. Be more like Sam, this wonderful teen. Surround yourself with positive people, love them and move forward.", "id": "high9055.txt"}
