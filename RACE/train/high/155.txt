He had made a lot of money in trading with foreign countries. When he was seventy-five, he gave PS 12,000 to the village school to buy land and equipment   for a children's play ground.\nAs a result of his kindness, many people came to visit him. Among them was a newspaperman, During their talk, Johnson remarked that he was seventy-five and expected to live to be a hundred. The newspaperman asked him how he managed to be healthy at seventy-five, Johnson had a sense of humor  . He liked whisky   and drank some each day. \"I have an injection   in my neck each evening.\" He told the newspaperman, thinking of evening glass of whisky.\nThe newspaperman did not understand what Johnson meant.

Within a week Johnson received thousands of letters from all over Britain, asking him for the secret of his daily injection.", "id": "high155.txt"}
