It has transformed the industrial city of Bilbao into a travelers' desired destination. The beautiful architecture of the museum has provided a dramatic background for movies and commercials.\nThe Louvre in Paris, France\nProbably the most famous Louvre also holds the most famous painting in the world, the\"Mona Lisa\"by Leonardo da Vinci. Crowds can be found any day surrounding the small, but mysterious painting of the smiling woman. But, the Louvre is much more than a home to the\"Mona Lisa\". The Louvre is visited by more people each year than any other museum in the world.\nThe Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, America\nJust opened in its new downtown location in 2012, the Barnes Foundation is unique in that it is a completely reproduced display from one man's private collection. Dr. Albert C. Barnes started collecting art in the early 20th century and collected, among others, the largest number of original Renoir paintings in the world.\nThe Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy\nWalking on the marbled floors feels like stepping back in time. The building itself is a beautiful palace-like structure with frescoes decorating the ceilings and walls. Viewers are bowled over  by the works by Botticelli, such as\"The Birth of Venus\". Classic artworks from nearly 1,000 years ago describe religious events of the time.", "id": "high19580.txt"}
