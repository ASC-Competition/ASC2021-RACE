The pair decided to begin a strange, year-long project to battle their debt.\nThe men, Ross Harper and Ed Moyse, set up the site BuyMyFace.co.uk. last October as a way to get rid of the $80,000 they shared as student loans. The idea behind the project was to earn money by selling their faces as advertising space every day for a year. Each day, they advertise a different business on their site by painting the brand's logo or name on their faces and including a link to the company's site. After they paint their faces and publish them on the site, Harper and Moyse go out to highly populated areas such as music festivals and theme parks to maximize their faces' exposure.\nAt this time, Harper and Moyse have advertised their faces for over four months without skipping a day and they're more than halfway to their goal. Though they first started charging a minimum of about USD $1.60 per company, the prices have risen as their popularity increased. For advertising space during the remainder of April, they range between USD $250 and $750.\nTerri L. Rittenburg, associate professor of marketing at the University of Wyoming, said she had heard of people tattooing   logos on themselves before, but this idea is much better. According to her, at first the idea would be new and novel and attract attention, but she is unsure how long it would last.\nAt least for now, companies that have bought Harper and Moyse's faces have written positive comments on the pair's website. \"We had a three percent increase in website traffic on the very day and for two days more afterwards,\" said an alcoholic beverage company.", "id": "high1662.txt"}
