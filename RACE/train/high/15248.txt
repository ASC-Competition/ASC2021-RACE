They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare.\nThe genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old.\nSome of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children.\nThe studies show that tiny mutations   in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan  . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy.\nDavid Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread.\n\"If we know which genes control longevity   then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\" he told The Times.\n\"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged   to take it.\"", "id": "high15248.txt"}
