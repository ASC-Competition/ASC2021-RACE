Although the inside of the boat is very _ it has no running water or electricity. Fiona says she can live without these things but she plans to take her small CD player, her hot water bottle and a bag of books to make sure life isn't too uncomfortable.\nWe asked her if she was afraid of being at sea for so long. She said, \"Well, I'm going to take a good compass  . Anyway I'm not afraid of death because I love the sea---I just hope it loves me.\" Fiona certainly has plenty of energy; in her spare time, she enjoys playing the piano, rock-climbing, canoeing and dancing.
