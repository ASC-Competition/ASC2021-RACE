As we got there, we saw a big sign. It said, \"Petting Zoo\". The kids jumped up and asked, \"Daddy, can we go?\" Both my wife and I were out of work. However, I said, \"Sure\", giving them a quarter each. They went away, leaving only fifty cents  left in my pocket.\nA petting zoo is an enclosure   for kids to play with little animals while parents shop. A few minutes later, I saw Susan walking along behind me. I was surprised and asked why. She said sadly, \"Well, Daddy, a ticket for Petting Zoo costs fifty cents. So I gave Robbie my quarter.\" Then she said my family motto  , \"Love is Action!\"\nI knew no one loves little animals more than Susan. She often watched my wife and me do and say \"Love is Action!\", and now she had put  _ it _  into her lifestyle. It had become part of her. She knew not only \"Love is Action!\", but also \"Love is Sacrificial   Action!\" I was moved. We went back to the Petting Zoo. Susan stood with her hands and chin   resting on the fence   and just watched Robbie feeding the animals. I had fifty cents burning a hole in my pocket. I put my hand into my pocket and took out the money. Sure, I must do that!", "id": "high18948.txt"}
