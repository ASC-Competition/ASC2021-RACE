I am not going to pay this bill. Last month I bought a table and four chairs for $65.50. They were sent to me on December 18. That night one leg of the table broke while my wife was putting our dinner on it. It fell on one of the chair, and that broke, too. Our $ 2.50 steak  landed on the floor, and the dog ate it.\nI spoke to the salesmen who had sold me the table and the chairs. He told me to write you a letter. I wrote you on December 20, saying that I was not going to pay for the furniture. On December 21 some men came and took it back to the store.\nPlease do something about your records. I do not want to receive another bill for the furniture which I returned.\nYours truly\nAlberts Robbins", "id": "high15177.txt"}
