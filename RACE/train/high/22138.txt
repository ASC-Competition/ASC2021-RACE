He has won 14 major tournament  titles and about $122 million in prize money and ads. He also has a happy family. It seems that he is too perfect to be one of us. But Woods has more in common with you than you might think.\nWoods' parents -- particularly his father -- set high expectations for him when he was a child. Before Earl Woods' death in 2006, he told Golf magazine, \"My purpose in raising Tiger was not to raise a golfer. I wanted to raise a good person.\"\nBy age two, Woods was already swinging  a golf club. But once he entered school, Woods' father was careful to send the message that school work came first. Woods wasn't allowed to practice until his homework was done.\nWhen Woods finally reached the professional tour, his father continued to expect a lot of him. \"Tiger will do more than any other man in history to change the course of human. The world is just getting a taste of his power,\" he said in 1996. Clearly, Earl Woods had great expectations of his son.\nIn this way, Tiger Woods is actually like a lot of us. Many of us feel a similar pressure to make our parents proud. When this happens, it's easy to let that pressure overwhelm  us.\nIn a perfect world, we would all grow up to be Tiger Woods-like successes in our own fields. But that isn't possible. There are many things that we can't control in this life, despite our best efforts.\nThere is, however, one thing that we can do: we can try to be a \"good person\", as Earl Woods asked his son to do.", "id": "high22138.txt"}
