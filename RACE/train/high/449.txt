About 5 minutes later, I was picked up by a driver, and he said how terrible some people were. I knew there was a part of me that wanted to be silent, but I had to listen out of kindness.\nThe man told me that he had just come from JFK Airport without a customer. During the taxi ride, what started as anger changed slowly and he mentioned that he had read an article which said that the happiest people are the ones that give, so he hoped he'd have more chance to give in his life. I was really starting to enjoy being with this man.\nAs we arrived at the place where I wanted to go, I paid my money by credit card. I pulled out an extra $20 and said, \"Sir, since we've been talking about giving this whole time, I want to share that feeling with you. I've already paid my money, but here's an extra little bit. You can tell the next passenger in this taxi that their ride is a gift from another.\"\nI thought I was pretty cool at this point, but he turned toward me, tears in his eyes, and said, \"Sir, I have a better idea. You give that $20 to a homeless person around here and I will give the next passenger a free ride myself.\nIt was a great honor meeting that man and learning the lesson of how everyone gives and adds joy to another with their generosity.", "id": "high449.txt"}
