Further research is needed to determine if and how headphone use threatens pedestrian safety .\" British road safety groups warned pedestrians to be careful.\nFloor Lieshout , director of Youth For Road Safety , said, \" This study shows once more the importance of using all of our senses while we are near traffic . It is important that we find an attractive way to make youth learn about the risks of wearing headphones in traffic .\"\nAndrew Howard , who is the head of road safety at the Automobile Association , added that some pedestrians can be \"so focused in their own little world they forget the world going on around them\".That can include headphone wearers , Howard said, but also people talking on phones.\nHowever , Howard said that more researches needed to be done.\nEarlier studies have shown that people wearing headphones or talking on phones can suffer \"inattentional blindness\" which makes them isolated   from the world around them .\nIan Harvey , at the charity Civic Voice , said that \" to defeat isolation and to help build a civic  society , people need to interact  with each other .\nHe said , \" A basis for any civilized society is communication--- Surfing the web , listening to MP3s , reading blogs or sending e-mail is not interacting with a person; it's interacting with a machine.\n\"If people feel socially isolated , they need to have more face-to-face interactions with other human beings and in time , will begin to feel happier and more connected to the world and place they live in .\"", "id": "high4438.txt"}
