Now Evolta, Panasonic's 7-inch Humanoid Robot is getting ready for his biggest challenge -- the Ironman Triathlon   Championship in Hawaii.\n         To compete in this exhausting contest, the green & white robot which is small enough to fit on a human palm, will have to swim 2.4 miles in the rough ocean, bike 112 miles across the hot Hawaiian desert and, run a full marathon distance of 26.2 miles in the painfully hot weather.\n         Given that he is so tiny and powered by rechargeable batteries   of Panasonic, he will be allowed some freedom in the way he competes. For one, he will be starting the race on October 23rd, 2011, three weeks following the real event and, while human competitors have at most 17 hours to complete the triathlon, Evolta will be given 7 days, during which his only \"breaks\" will be to recharge his batteries.\n         The biggest difference however, will be that unlike a single human body doing all three races, there will be three different \"Evolta\" robot bodies competing -- each built for the specific race. Evolta the swimmer will be equipped with special arms to swim forward. Evolta the biker, will be on a little two-wheeler with training wheels, while Evolta the runner, will be fixed on what looks like a wheel.\n         In spite of all these advantages, the robot's creator Tomotaka Takahashi believes that the race will be a huge challenge -- not only will Evolta have to battle the wind and sun, but also, small road obstacles   that humans just step over. The water will be even worse thanks to the strong waves, tides and ocean winds. But if he does complete it, Evolta will add another feather in his cap and just prove the already well-known fact that Panasonic's rechargeable Evolta batteries are indeed the \"world's longest-lasting batteries\"!", "id": "high23576.txt"}
