To be honest, I can't imagine we will do without him when he's gone.\nBill Masters almost single-handed built up our sales force in the Houston area and developed the market position that we enjoy today. In only six years, he has brought the firm from a very low fifth position in the area sales to the point where we now outsell all but one of our competitors. Not only have we got 37 per cent of the market under Bill's leadership; we are increasing our share with each passing month.\nAs you know, the company has moved Bill to northern California to work his sales magic in one of this company's most competitive  areas. But we know that if anyone can do it, Bill Masters can, and I know you all join me in wishing him the best of luck in his new work.", "id": "high2311.txt"}
