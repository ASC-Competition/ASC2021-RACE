I whizzed there in a taxi from the office and battled through the milling people on the 2nd day of the sales on the ground floor up to the 5th to the china department. There was a man standing there who was obviously a sales person who I rushed up to and asked if he had this particular china in stock and if it would take long to wrap, etc. He was amazing. He got the plates in seconds, wrapped them up and asked me if I wanted a store card, to which I replied no, because I lived in Switzerland, to which he replied asking if, as I lived abroad, would like a tax rebate form . After that he showed me what to do, produced a map of the store and told me where I should go for the formalities . That was fabulous! I thanked him and said what wonderful service he had given me. I even asked if he gave this to everyone, to which he answered: \"I'm just doing what is required at Harrods\". With that, a tall man in a gray suit approached me and offered his hand to shake mine saying, \"Can I introduce myself? I am the Chief Executive of Harrods and what an interesting conversation I have just heard...\" He had been wandering through the store (as you should do as a hands-on CEO) and had overheard me thanking this salesman, whose face, I can hardly describe, was frozen in a mixture of delight awe and astonishment!\nCan you imagine the salesman going home to his family and friends recounting what the CEO spoke to him after overhearing him being praised by a customer?", "id": "high3619.txt"}
