What most passengers don't realize\nis that their minute is already there.\n    Every commuter train that departs from New York Cityabout 900 a d\nleaves a minute later than scheduled. If the timetable says 8:14, the train will actually leave at\n8:15.In other words, if you think you have only a minute to get that trainwell, relax. You\nhave two.\n    The courtesy minute , in place for decades and published only in private\ntimetables for employees, is meant for those who need the extra time to get off the platform and\nonto the train.\n    \"If everyone knows they get an extra minute, they're going to waste time doing\nunimportant things,\" explained Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for the Metro-North Railroad.\nTold of this article, Ms. Anders laughed. \"Don't blow our cover!\"she said.\n    Entirely hidden from the riding public, the secret minute is an odd departure from the\nrailroad culture of down-to-the-second accuracy.

And most commuters know their train by the accurate minute\nit departs. The trains quickly make up the minute:at all other stops, the public timetable is\ncarried out. The courtesy minute does not exist at commuter railroads in Chicago, Los Angeles,\nPhiladelphia, or San Francisco. But in New York, the secret minute dates back decades.\n    \"That's been done forever, from my knowledge,\" said Jack Swanberg, 70, an unofficial\nhistorian of Metro-North. \"I was the trainmaster starting in 1970 and I'm sure it's been the case\nsince 1870 for all I know.\"", "id": "high21112.txt"}
