Should they allow their children to train to become top sports men or women? For many children it means starting school work very young, and going out with friends and other interests have to  _ . It's very difficult to explain to a young child why he or she has to train five hours a day, even at the weekend, when most of his or her friends are playing.\nAnother problem is of course money. In many countries money for training is available from government for the very best young sports men and women. If this help can not be given, it means that it is the parents who have to find the time and the money to support their child's development---and sports clothes, transport to competitions, special equipment, etc. can all be very expensive.\nMany parents are worried that it is dangerous to start serious training in a sport at an early age. Some doctors agree that young muscles may be damaged by training before they are properly developed.
