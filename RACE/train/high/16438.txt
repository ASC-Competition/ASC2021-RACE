Researchers have found that those who eat a handful of peanuts every day significantly decrease their risk of dying from all causes compared to those who do not eat nuts. A new study concludes that all types of nuts seem to be protective.\nResearcher Ying Bao is with the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She and her colleagues looked at the impact of nut consumption by analyzing two huge studies that began in 1980 - the Nurses' Health Study, which tracks the\nof more than 76,000 women, and 42,000 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.\nAmong the questions asked at the beginning of the studies was, 'how frequently do you eat nuts?'  The information was updated every two to four years. Bao says the participants were followed for three decades.\n\"What we observed is that people who eat more nuts are less likely to die over the next 30 years,\" said Bao. \"So, for example, if a person eat(s) nuts once per day, that person has a 20 percent lower risk of dying.\"\nBao says eating a handful of nuts five or more times per week was associated with a 29 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease and an 11 percent lower risk of cancer death.  A serving size is 28 grams.\nNuts contain nutrients, including high quality proteins, vitamins and minerals, all of which have anti-cancer effects and may help protect the heart.\nBao says researchers are planning studies to find out how nuts are beneficial to human health.\nThe study on the health benefits of nuts was funded by the International Tree Nut Council Research and Education Foundation.", "id": "high16438.txt"}
