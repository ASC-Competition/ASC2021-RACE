The team, from Flinders University, in Adelaide, says the glasses send out a soft green glow that helps a traveller adapt to changing sleep patterns and time zones in \"small steps\". It targets a part of the brain that regulates the human body-clock, by sending signals to the rest of the body that help it slowly realise it is in a different area of the world. It has been suggested the device, called the \"Re-Timer\", is currently the only wearable body clock adjustment system commercially available.\nScientists say the device, officially launched in South Australia, can help ridf the negative effects of long-timel travel and bring new relief to insomnia  sufferers, shift workers and even teenagers.\n\"The light from Re-Timer stimulates the part of the brain responsible for regulating the 24-hour body clock,\" said Prof Leon Lack, its chief inventor.\nExtensive research has shown that green light is one of the most effective wavelengths  for influencing the body clock.\nThe battery-powered device, which retail for PS162 in Britain, then sends signals that cause the production of hormones and daily cycles known as circadian rhythms .\nThose people who want to sleep peacefully, but wake earlier, should wear it for 50 minutes in the morning for three days. Those who want a lie- in, should wear it for the same time before bed to delay the body clock. The device, which is powered by an inbuilt rechargeable battery, can also be worn as sunglasses during daily tasks such as reading or using a computer.\n\"The glasses have been designed to be user friendly and comfortable to wear so people can go about their normal activities wearing them at work or at home,\" he said, adding they had been designed based on 25 years of university research.\nIt is estimated that up to 94 per cent of long-time travellers suffer from jet lag because the body becomes confused to travelling through different time zones. So the glasses are good news to them. It uses the outside world as indicators as to whether it should be awake or asleep including factors such as light, silence or noise.\nAirlines are said to be seeking a \"silver bullet\" for the tiredness and confusion that often follow a long-timel flight and are in discussions to buy the device.", "id": "high17581.txt"}
