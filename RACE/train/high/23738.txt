They can happen any time of a day, at any point during the year. When an earthquake is happening, you should know what you should do or not do.\nDo NOT go outside. You could get injured from falling glass or parts of buildings. If you are outside, stay away from buildings and power lines.\nStay under a desk, table, or other strong furniture. Hold on to it. Or stay in a corner of the building. Cover your face and head with your arms and cover your mouth with a towel or clothing. Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside.\nKeep away from pictures or advertisements on the wall or the building, and anything else that could fall and hurt you. Most people get injured by falling things during an earthquake, not by the shaking itself.\nAlso keep away from a fire. You could fall down and burn yourself on the fire.\nIf you are driving when an earthquake happens, stop the car if it's safe. Stay inside your car until the earthquake stops, and don't drive near bridges. Try not to stop by power lines or trees. These could fall and hurt you.", "id": "high23738.txt"}
