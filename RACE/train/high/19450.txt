Here are some fun and calming reasons you might want to purchase one or two of your own.\nAs parents, we tend to get caught up in the daily routine of getting our families hurriedly out the door for school and work each day--only to fall into bed exhausted and then get up and do it all over again the next day.  We may not have much time to devote to a hobby, but if you grab yourself an adult color1ing book, you can get your creative juices flowing in a matter of minutes. \nParenting is wonderful but it's also full of daily stress that naturally go along with the job. Whether it be at the end of a busy day or you have a few free minutes while the baby naps, picking up a box of freshly, sharpened color1ed pencils and your favorite color1ing book can take your mind off your \"to do\" list and transport you to a whole other world--one where you can be free to just enjoy the rainbow and simply embrace a little unwinding time.\nWhether you choose to delight in color1ed pencils or an old-fashioned box of crayons, all you'll need to grab is either one and your favorite color1ing book. So if you're in the car while your son's finishing up soccer practice, or in the reception area waiting to have your teeth cleaned, your color1ing supplies are a breeze to take along and help you pass the time in a color1ful way. \nAnother benefit to taking up color1ing is that it can also become a family affair. Sitting together with your kids and color1ing is a great way to spend some quality time together, regardless of whether or not you stay within the lines!", "id": "high19450.txt"}
