S. pet stores and gift shops this summer.\nTokyo-based Takara Co. Ltd. says about 300, 000 of the dog translator gadgets have been sold since it was on sale in Japan late last year. It is forecasting far bigger sales once an English language translation for dogs comes to America in August. The United States is home to about 67 million dogs, more than six times the number in Japan.\n\"We know that the Americans love their dogs so much, so we don't think they will mind spending $ 120 on this product, \" the Takara marketing manager said during an interview at a recent pet products conference in Atlanta.\nRegarded as one of the coolest inventions of 2002 by Time magazine, Bowlingual is made up of a 3 - inch long wireless microphone that is fastened to a dog collar and sends out sounds to a small console   that is connected to a database  . The console divides each bark into six emotional types----happiness, sadness, disappointment, anger, threat and desire----and shows common phrases, such as \"You're ticking me off,\" that fit the dog's emotional state.\nTakara says it has spent millions of dollars developing the gadget in cooperation with famous sound experts and animal behaviorists.\nOne thing that does appear certain is that the markets for animal translation products will likely remain a dog's world since Takara has no plans to develop a similar gadget for cats. \" _ are too unpredictable   , \" the marketing manager said.", "id": "high2294.txt"}
