Instead, as they see it, solutions must develop from a better understanding of the humans that drive the system and from a fuller appreciation of the limits and potential  of the earth's resources.\nWhat this means is an increased emphasis on the life and earth sciences, on sociology, psychology, economics and even philosophy.\nMore and more of the best minds in science, particularly young researchers, are being drawn into these developing fields.\nAll this is not to say that technological creativity will not play a critical role in solving energy and food shortages, or that answers to environmental difficulties will not come from further advances in the same technologies that may have helped cause the problems.\nWhere the real challenge lies, in the view of the new generation of scientists, is in finding ways to produce goods and meet the world's needs, using less of the raw materials that are becoming short.", "id": "high7548.txt"}
