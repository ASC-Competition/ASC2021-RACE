You have lived next door to each other for years but knew very little about what happened on the other side of the fence.\nI traveled there last August. A simple 180-kilometre trip from a Chinese border town to Hanoi, capital of Viet Nam, took an adventurous eight hours. That's because the country still doesn't have a modern expressway system. The major passage going through the peninsula is only a two-way road. Also, many areas are mountainous.\nVietnamese drivers are impatient and fearless. They compete with each other at full speed no matter how scared the passengers feel. When the bus shook us violently many times, the driver made a joke to make us feel better. \"See, this is just a gift Vietnamese people give you, a free passage service.\"\nIt was midnight when I reached the hotel. Turning on the television, I was surprised by something : All the characters in the TV dramas spoke in the same voice. At present, modern Korean dramas and historical Chinese dramas are popular with the Vietnamese. But it seemed they didn't have enough money to dub  all these programmes. So, the same boring woman would appear behind every drama to speak for the roles.\nThe next morning when I opened the window, I found myself in a huge \"garden\". The buildings in the streets were dressed in all kinds of colors you can imagine. Vietnamese residents are allowed to paint their houses as they like. Each one is different and the colors bring the city alive.", "id": "high9517.txt"}
