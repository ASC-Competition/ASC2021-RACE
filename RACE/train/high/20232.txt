You have probably seen the movies. But have you heard the music? The latest Harry Potter news is that bands form to play what is called \"wizard rock\" or sometimes just \"wrock\".\nThe new kind of music began when Joe De George and his brother Paul decided that the characters from Harry Potterwould make a great band. Ron on guitar, Hermione on bass, Hagrid on drums and Harry singing up front would make for an excellent group. In one day, the brothers wrote, rehearsed and performed six songs about life at Hogwarts. After the first performance, Paul decided that \"we are Harry and the potters.\"\nWizard rock is pretty much what it sounds like: rock \"n\" rock inspired by and set in the world of Harry Potter. The De George started a trend. Today there are dozens of wizard-rock bands: the Whomping Willows, the Remus Lupins and the Moaning Myrtles to name a few. Rockers dress like Hogwarts students and play at conventions and festivals. \nPeople who like Harry Potter think wizard rock music is totally _ . The songs can be funny, but the music is not a joke. Just ask the De George brothers. They've played more than 500 shows in 49 states and their hit songs are inspired by characters fromHarry Potter: \"Save Ginny Weasley\" and \"Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock!\" The themes of their music are the same as those of Rowling's books: love and friendship, upset and struggle.\nWizard rock is just one more by-product in the Harry Pottercraze. Two years after J.K. Rowling published her last book in the series, Potter popularity continues to grow. There are Potter conventions and Potter clubs that try to get kids and grow-ups to help fight hunger, for example. And the fact that they may do it while humming \"Wizard Chess\" or \"Platform 9\" makes those meetings fun.", "id": "high20232.txt"}
