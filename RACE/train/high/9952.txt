This is a television show for all families, and I know you'll enjoy it.\nLet's start with a story. Once there was a proud pig on a farm. He thought he was the most important of all the animals on the farm. But it was not enough that he himself thought this: he had to be sure that other animals thought it, too. So he went up to a chicken and asked, \"Who is the most important animal on the farm?\" The chicken answered, \"You are, Mr. Pig.\" Then he asked a dog, and he got the same answer.\nNext, he asked a cow. When the cow seemed _ of the right answer, the pig looked angry, and showed his teeth, \"Oh, you are, of course, Mr. Pig.\" said the cow. \"Of course,\" the pig said, \"there is no doubt about it. \"\nAt last the pig asked a big horse the same question. The horse lifted one foot, rolled the pig over and placed his foot on the pig's head. \"I think you know the answer now.\" said the horse.", "id": "high9952.txt"}
