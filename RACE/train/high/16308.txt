One tool that is getting some attention is the use of video games.\nSixteenyearold John Diaz says he loves playing video games but doesn't like traditional schoolwork. During his summer vacation,Diaz is continuing his studies at home. That is because his courses are available on his home computer.\nFlorida Virtual School's head master,Julie Young,says the school teaches students with the technology they most enjoy using in and out of school.\"We have so many students who feel free in our school,\" Young said, \"They lose interest when they go to school.
