Two hundred years on, his stories still speak volumes across the world, proving that Dickens' legacy  was far greater that just \"great-literature\".\nFebruary 7 marks the 200thanniversary of the writer's birthday. To mark this date, BBC writer Alex Hudson listed six things Dickens gave the modern world. Let's take a look at two of them.\nA White Christmas\nDickens is described as \"the man who invented Christmas\" - not the religious festival, but the cultural aspects that we associate with the festive season today.\nIn the early 19thcentury, Christmas was barely worth mentioning, according to critic and writer Leigh Hunt. The committee which ran the Conservative Party even held ordinary business meetings on Christmas Day-unthinkable in the West nowadays, when everyone but the most necessary workers takes at least three days off.\nMany people believe that Dickens' popular descriptions of the festive period became a blueprint for generations to come. In his classic novel,A Christmas Carol, he not only put forward the idea of snow at Christmas, but also painted a picture of glowing warmth-\"home enjoyments, affections and hopes\".\nIn his biography of Dickens, Peter Ackroyd wrote: \"Dickens can be said to have almost single-handedly created the modern idea of Christmas.\"\n\"Dickens\" poverty\nDickens was one of the first to take an honest look at the underclass and the poor of Victorian London.\nHe helped popularize the term \" _ \" to describe situations where people in power use needless amounts of bureaucracy  in a way that particularly hurts the weaker and poorer members of society.\n\"Dickensian\" has now become a powerful word for describing an unacceptable level of poverty. In 2009, when the president of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in the UK wanted to talk about poverty in some areas of Britain, she did not use words like \"terrible\" or \"horrific\", but rather described it as \"life mirroring the times of Dickens\".", "id": "high179.txt"}
