He was lame. They lived in a village near a forest. Everyone in the village was going to a rich man's dinner on the other side of the forest. Jee Hock and Meng Kim were anxious to attend the dinner too.\n    Blind Jee Hock thought of a plan. He would carry Meng Kim. The lame man could tell him the way. Meng Kim said that the plan was a good one.\n    On the way through the forest, Meng Kim saw a tiger. He did not tell Jee Hock about it. Instead, he quietly asked Jee Hock to carry him to the nearest tree. Upon reaching an over banging branch, Meng kim quickly hauled himself up.\n    Then the tiger roared. Jee Hock at once knew a tiger was near. He lay down quietly. The tiger came to him and sniffed his body. The tiger's whiskers touched Jee Hock's nose. At once Jee Hock sneezed, \"Ah choooooo!\" The tiger was afraid and ran away. \n    Then Meng Kim came down from the tree. He asked Jee Hock about the tiger. Jee Hock said that the tiger had told him to choose his friends wisely.", "id": "high20168.txt"}
