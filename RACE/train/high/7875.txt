One by one, graffiti-covered walls are being changed into outdoor art. So far, more than 1,800 murals have been painted. Philadelphia now has more murals than any other American city.\nThe walls that were once ugly with graffiti are now covered with beautiful pictures of historical heroes and modern art, thanks to the Mural Arts Program (MAP). Its work makes schools and public places attractive, and its citizens very proud. The program began as part of Philadelphia's Anti-Graffiti Network. Jane Golden is the MAP's artistic director. \"When people ask me what our program is about,\" she says, \"I answer them with one word: hope.\" Each year, the MAP offers youth art programs and workshops. Some one-time graffiti writers even help paint MAP murals.\nThe MAP's work, says Golden, is all about developing a sense of community  . When a neighborhood requests a mural, the MAP works with the people there to develop a message. Some messages have been \"Safe Streets,\" \"Love and Care,\" and \"Peace Walk.\"\nThe MAP receives up to 50 requests for murals each week. Last year, the workers painted 140 murals.\n\"The making of a mural enters people's collective memory as an extraordinary, pleasant moment in neighborhood history\" says Golden, who began as a muralist in Los Angeles.", "id": "high7875.txt"}
