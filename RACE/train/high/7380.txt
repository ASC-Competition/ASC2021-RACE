The students from Class 2, Senior 2 of the High School Affiliated to Peking University certainly did so before they published their own collection of English novels at home.\nTheir small book contains stories about a holy   war, the happy life of a self-taught artist and the story of a laid-off worker who devoted his last breath to playing his beloved accordion  . The book becomes an instant hit on campus. About 3,000 copies have been sold and the class is already working on the second volume.\n\"We're up to our ears in homework. Exercises and exams make us out of breath. But to do something creative and full of imagination is such a great achievement,\" said Yu Xiaoxiao, 16. \"I took the writing as an ordinary homework at the beginning, but after I finished the first part of my story, I could not help but let it flow,\" said Wang An, who wrote \"Accordion\".\nInspired by \"Lord of the Rings\", Jiang Lu wrote his story about magic wins between angels from the light and the dark side. \"The main message of the story was to look at the balance of the world. Both dark and light angels fight with love as their weapons. I want to tell people that selfish love might bring hate,\" Jiang said.\n\"I was shocked by their work and felt so proud to be the editor of my students' book,\" said Nathaniel Timmermann, the oral English teacher at the school. Liu Xiuqin, an English teacher, started the project by asking students to write whatever was in their mind every week. \"They have performed beyond expectation,\" Liu said. \"They wrote interesting stories and their English has improved after they started to express their real minds.\"\n\"We never imagined that our homework would be so popular and profitable  . We sell the novels at five yuan, but many teachers pay more to encourage us,\" said Yuan Mengyao.", "id": "high7380.txt"}
