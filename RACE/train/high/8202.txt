I grew up without knowing what a father was and no one was there to teach me how to behave and how to tell right from wrong. Because of this, I developed problems with alcohol and spent seven years as a boy in the street, before ending up in a rehab clinic  when I was 20.\nInside I met my counselor , Bill, and he taught me a lot of things. The main thing was the gift of giving. It was the night before an important test and I was very nervous. Bill saw this and suggested that we should go out for a walk. As we walked and talked, Bill suggested we should go for a coffee. I told him I was broke, and when I got paid, I would pay him back. He stopped then and looked at me in a serious but loving way and said, \"No, you won't.\" He told me that I didn't owe   him anything and he was doing this because he wanted to. He then told me something that has followed me to this day, \"One day you'll be around someone and they'll need a coffee, and you'll be able to buy it for them. That's how you can pay me back.\"\nI'm a primary school teacher now; far away from the life I had ten years ago. My job is simple and I buy young people coffee now. Bill taught me how to do that.", "id": "high8202.txt"}
