For two weeks I would try to be a loving husband and father. Totally loving. No ifs, ands or buts.\nThe idea had come to me as I listened to a talk on my car radio. The speaker was quoting   a Biblical   passage about husbands being considerate towards their wives. Then he went on to say, \"Love is an act of will. A person can choose to love.\" To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband. Well, for two weeks that would change.\nAnd it did. Right from the moment I kissed Evelyn at the door and said, \"That new yellow sweater looks great on you.\"\n\"Oh, Tom, you noticed,\" she said, surprised and pleased, maybe a little puzzled.\nAfter the long drive, I wanted to sit and read.

Tom, you've been so good to me... Am I dying?\"\nIt took a moment for it all to sink in. Then I burst out laughing.\n\"No, honey,\" I said, wrapping her in my arms. \"You're not dying;\n.\"", "id": "high15849.txt"}
