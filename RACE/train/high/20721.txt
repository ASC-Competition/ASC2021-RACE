British and Swiss researchers conducted a study showing that advertisements featuring endorsements by celebrities like David Beckham and Scarlett Johansson are not as effective as those by ordinary people. The difference is that regular people prefer to purchase goods that are bought by other regular people.\n     In s sample of 298 university students, researchers presented a magazine advertisement for a digital camera that included an endorsement by an imaginary student saying the camera was \"hot\" and his \"preferred choice.\" The same advertisement was shown to other students, but with a difference:the camera was endorsed by a famous person in Germany. The researchers also measured how important it was for consumers that the purchased products make a good impression on others.\n      While the students said that both advertisements were beneficial, the one made by the student topped the celebrity one if students aimed to impress others with their purchases. More than half of the students, who admitted to purchasing products that would impress others, said they were influenced by the student advertisement. Only 20% said the celebrity one would affect their buying decision. For those who do not buy to impress, only 5% focused on the student advertisement.\n     Professor Brett Martin from the University of Bath's School of Management, explained that the findings can be used not only in Germany, but in other countries as well. \"Our re-search questions whether celebrities are the best way to sell products,\" said Mr. Martin.\"Celebrities can be effective but we found that many people were more convinced by an endorsement from an ordinary person. This is because many people, feel a need to keep up with the Jones\" when they buy. \"", "id": "high20721.txt"}
