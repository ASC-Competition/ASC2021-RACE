To have people waiting on you hand and foot? Many Americans experience this royal treatment every day. How? By being customers. The American idea of customer service is to make each customer the center of attention. Need proof? Just listen to the commercials. Most of them sound like the McDonald's ad: \"We do it all for you.\" Actually, not all stores in America roll out the red carpet for their customers. But wherever you go, good customer service means making customers feel special.\nPeople going shopping in America can expect to be treated with respect from the very beginning. Most places don't have a \"furniture street\" or a \"computer road\" which allow you to compare prices easily. Instead, people often \"let their fingers do the walking\" through the store hot lines. From the first \"hello\", customers receive a satisfying response to their questions. This initial contact can help them decide where to shop.\nWhen customers get to the store, they are treated as honored guests. Customers don't usually find store clerks sitting around watching TV or playing cards. Instead, the clerks greet them warmly and offer to help them find what they want. In most stores, the clear signs that label each department make shopping a breeze. Customers usually don't have to ask how much items cost, since prices are clearly marked. And unless they're at a flea market or a yard sale, they don't bother trying to bargain.\nWhen customers are ready to check out, they find the nearest and shortest checkout lane. But as Murphy's Law would have it, whichever lane they get in, all the other lanes will move faster. Good stores open new checkout lanes when the lanes get too long. Some even offer express lanes for customers with 10 items or less. After they pay for their purchases, customers receive a smile and a warm \"thank you\" from the clerk. Many stores even allow customers to take their shopping carts out to the parking lot. That way, they don't have to carry heavy bags out to the car.", "id": "high6415.txt"}
