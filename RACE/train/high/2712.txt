Netizens call her the \"dog with determination\" and the micro blog \"Go Go Xiao Sa\" recording her life has attracted more than 37,000 followers in two weeks.\nA picture of Xiao Sa in the arms of a young man in front of the Potala Palace on Thursday night drew more than 4,000 comments congratulating the small dog and expressing dreams of going to Lhasa.\nThe young man in the picture is Zhang Heng, 22, a student in Wuhan, Hubei province. As his graduation trip, he decided to face the challenge of riding to Lhasa alone. On the way he met a lonely dog. \"She was lying, tired, on the street around Yajiang, Sichuan province,\" he said. \"So we fed her, and then she followed our team.\"\n\"We felt she might want to come along with us, so we decided to bring her along to the end.\" A week later, Zhang and his buddies opened a micro blog account for her. \"We thought the dog was encouraging us, and wanted others to know its story,\" he said. They created the name Xiao Sa by combining xiao meaning \"little\" with the last syllable of Lhasa.\nDuring their journey, Xiao Sa, Zhang and his team covered more than 1,700 kilometers and climbed 10 mountains higher than 4,000 meters. Xiao Sa just ran up the mountains or along dirt roads.\n\"Many people stopped cycling in some sections, then took the bus, but the dog made it,\" he said. Zhang put the dog on the back of the bike when the team was riding downhill. \"The speed can reach 70 kilometers per hour, impossible for the dog to catch us.\"\nZhang Heng, who accompanied Xiao Sa for 20 days, called her \"a buddy and a friend\". \"I would like to take the dog home and take care of her. She has been a stray on the road for a long time. She needs a home.\"", "id": "high2712.txt"}
