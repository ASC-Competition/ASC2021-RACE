While she's doing this,she pretends to guide cloth through the machine. \n    Each Tuesday afternoon,after the bell rings for the fourth period, Liu becomes a fashion designer. At the same time,the rest of the students at the High School Attached to Yunnan Normal University in Kunming are also having classes a little bit different from the usual ones. Some students dance,others create robots,and still others review films. These are just a few of the 28 elective courses the school began to offer last month. \"The fashion design class has become the bright point of my week. I learn how to choose color1s and cloth as well as sewing and sketching  skills. It's all helping me to realize the dream of becoming a fashion designer I've had since I was a little girl,\" Liu said. \n    Design is Liu' s passion,but for other students the electives are more an opportunity to take a fun course that relieves the pressures of schoolwork. Some students,for example,are learning how to play bridge.\n    Chen Xiejiao,15,is one of them. \"Many people think that playing a card game like this in class is a waste of time. But in fact,bridge is a very challenging game that helps develop memory and math skills,\" she said. \n    Li Ke,15, is studying robotics. \"I hope to have built and designed my own robot by the end of the semester. It will be able to complete a task,like moving a bail from one place to another,\" he said .", "id": "high18172.txt"}
