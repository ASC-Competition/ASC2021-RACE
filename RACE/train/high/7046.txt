She loves teaching very much. One day when she was giving an English lesson, she found the headmaster sitting at the back of the classroom. After class, the headmaster told her that he came to her class to find out how much English and how much Chinese she was using. The result was about half English and half Chinese. She was using Chinese when she gave instructions to her students and when she wanted to get feedback   from her students. The headmaster told her that she should use more English in her class.\nMiss Wu made a plan like this:\n*talk with an Englishman every Sunday for two hours to learn more English expressions;\n*write some English expressions on cards. These cards not only _ her to use English in class, but also help her remember some expressions;\n*have a five-minute talk in English with students before class.\nShe used body language to help her if students could not understand.\nOne year later, she found she could use English freely in class.", "id": "high7046.txt"}
