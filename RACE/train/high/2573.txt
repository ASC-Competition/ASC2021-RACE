People are still going to like you. They may even respect you more because they know you are honest.\nI,m not saying to say\"no\" to someone who really needs your help. I'm talking about re-fusing that meeting that you really do not want to attend or that birthday party that you don't want to be a guest at.\nThink for a moment how you feel when you say YES to something that you really don't want to do. If you're like I once was,you can't sleep at night and you think about it too much. It weighs on your mind. You try to find ways out. Whatever you're saying to yourself,if you really wanted to go,you wouldn't have all of these thoughts.\nSo,why not just say NO from the beginning? Maybe you feel like if you don't show up at the meeting(by the way,it is not one you must attend) your boss isn't going to like you or your co-workers won't respect you. Maybe you feel as if your mom,dad or sisters won't love you as much if you don't do everything for them that they ask every occasion.\nIf these people are your true friends,family members,or a good boss,they will like or love you the same no matter what. People treat you the way you teach them to,and if you're some-one who always says\"yes\" then that's what they,re expecting.\nYou need to do what is right for you. Of course we do have real obligations in life to ful-fill,but we do not have to do everything others want us to do.", "id": "high2573.txt"}
