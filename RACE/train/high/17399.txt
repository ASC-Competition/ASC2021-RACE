It provides training chances for young people aged 14 to 16 with the help of the local government, particularly those struggling in mainstream education or rejected from school.\n\"It's about engaging young people with education and youth training by teaching them work and life skills,\" explains Des Pearce, workshop training manager. \"These young people have so much potential, but often don't realize it.\"\nFounded in 2001, ReCycle Bikes repairs bicycles donated by the public, which are sold for PS20 after refurbished. Abandoned bikes supplied by the government make sure a steady flow of bikes, but a recently formed partnership with Sheffield University should improve the further development.\n\"The student population presents a large and ready market,\" says Pearce. \"So we approached the university last year and offered to host bike sales on the campus   . They thought it was a great idea, and agreed to provide us with more support. This means we can train young people to repair extra 500 bikes over three years.\"\nHaving set up ReCycle Bikes on his own, Pearce now has the staff and resources to track the profession development of those who have passed through his workshop. \"But we are planning exit interviews with the young people to make sure what they plan to do, and these will allow us to check on their progress,\" says Pearce.\nThat most of the teenagers enjoy the work is, according to Pearce, easily explained. \"Most kids have ridden a bike and know how to oil a chain or mend a flat tyre. As low-cost transport, cycling gives the young and old a sense of freedom and independence, and the effect on their well-being is big. Add to that a growing concern for the environment, and it's no surprise that bike sales are on the increase.\"", "id": "high17399.txt"}
