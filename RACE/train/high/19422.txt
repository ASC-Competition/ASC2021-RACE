After school Michael walked past the shop on the street corner. He stopped to look at the front row of shoes. And he felt sorry for himself. He really wanted to have them for his birthday.\n  He sadly walked away and thought of what to tell his mother. He knew she would give anything he liked if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home immediately, as he looked worried and his mother would notice it. So he went to the park where he sat on the grass. Then he saw a boy in a wheelchair. He noticed that the boy moved the wheel with his hands. Michael looked at him carefully and was surprised to see the boy had no feet. He looked down his own feet. \"It is much better to be without shoes than without feet.\" He thought. There was no reason for him to feel so sorry and sad.
