It's good to see so many of you here this evening. I'm sure you're all enjoyed the fine food,and that you are ready to hear our guest speaker. \nLadies and gentlemen,we're pleased to welcome our most famous club champion,Billy Rogers,to our meeting. \nBilly needs no introduction because he is one of the most well-known tennis players in our country. However,I must mention a few things about him. Billy has won the US Open three times,and Wimbledon twice. He has won more tennis tournaments than any player from this country. He has been ranked number one in the world in both singles and doubles. He has played in the Davis Cup and the Hopman Cup for his country. His Wimbledon victory two years ago has been called one of the bravest in the modern time. Had he not been injured,he would undoubtedly have won a third Wimbledon Championship. Billy is regarded by many as perhaps the finest player ever in international tennis. \nBut of course Billy is much more than a tennis champion. \nHe is like an ambassador for the sport and for his country. He has done great work to help children around the world,and his generosity to children's charity funds is well known. \nAnd of course,Billy is the most successful graduate of our club. He won the club championships when he was twelve--yes,at only twelve. And Billy has not forgotten where it all started. That's why he accepted our invitation to speak to us tonight. We're proud to have played a small part in Billy's success. \nWon't you please give a big hand to our own Billy Rogers?", "id": "high16948.txt"}
