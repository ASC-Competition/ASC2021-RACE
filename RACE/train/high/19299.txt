He walks out of the store with milk. That is all--milk. At the same time, a woman enters the same grocery store also to buy milk. She buys it. But, she also buys chicken and lemons to make dinner that night. She also gets a bottle of wine for drinks with friends and a birthday card for her husband's niece. And that is the difference between the female and male brains simply explained in a grocery store. Generally speaking, men do one thing at a time. Women do many. Doing many things at one time is often called \"multi-tasking,\" a very popular word these days.\nNow scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains. A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along--men and women think differently.\nScientists at the University of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from 8 to 22 years old. They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain, or hemisphere. In the female brain, they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain. The left side of the brain is known as the side of \"reason\". The right hemisphere is known as the \"creative\" side.\nRegina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She co-wrote the report. She says when women are asked to do something complicated they might use different parts of the brain. But men generally use just one.\nAs a result, men generally deal directly with a problem. There is a strong connection between the \"understanding\" and the \"action\" parts of their brains. Women, however, might include other parts of the brain, like the part connected with \"reason\" and the part connected with sensitivity when solving a problem. Women take a less direct path to find a solution.\nThanks for your listening. I'm your announcer Anna Matteo.", "id": "high19299.txt"}
