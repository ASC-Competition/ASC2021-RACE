Douglas was a student in one of my calsses. (I have not used his real name for personal reasons. As he requested.) But here is his real story as he told it before one of our adult - education classes. He told us how tragedy had struck at his home, not once, but twice. The first time he had lost his five-old daughter, a child he adored. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss; but, as he said:\"Ten months later, God gave us another little girl and she died in five days.\"\nThis double\nwas almost too much to bear. \"I couldn't take it,\" this father told us. \"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't rest or relax. My nerves were entirely shaken and my confidence gone.\" At last he went to doctors; one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip. He tried both, but neither helped. He said:\"My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice , and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter.\" The tension of grief ----if you have ever been paralyzed by sorrow, you know what he meant.\nBut thank God, I had one child left ----a four --year-- old son. He gave me the solution to my problem. One afternoon as I sat around feeling sorry for myself, he asked; 'Daddy, will you build a boat for me?' I was in no mood to build a boat; in fact, I was in no mood to do anything. But my son is a persistent little fellow! I had to give in.\nBuilding that toy boat took me about three hours. By the time it was finished, I realized that those three hours spent building that boat were first hours of mental relaxation and peace that I had had in months! I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing something that requires planning and thinking. In my case, building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy.\nThe following night, I went from room to room in the house, making a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired: bookcase, stair steps, storm windows, window-shades, locks, leaky taps. Amazing as it seems, in the course of two weeks I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention.\n\"During the last two years I have completed most of them. I am busy now that I have no time for worry.\"\nNo time for worry! That is exactly what Winston Churchill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his huge responsibilities, he said :\"I am too busy. I have no time for worry.\"", "id": "high16207.txt"}
