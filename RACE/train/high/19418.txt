At the age of 35, I decided to work on the plane against the will of my children. After my first plane ride at the age of five, I felt so excited that I had a dream of earning my wings on the plane. I didn't earn much, but I loved my job. \n    We were flying from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C, when I answered a call. Then I went to the cabin  , I found a young mother struggling with her baby son. \n    She told me that she had no more diapers  . With the saddest eyes I have ever seen, she continued. She said she had two babies, but she could no longer support two of them. She was taking her son to a family in New Hampshire.  \n    As she stood in front of me, crying, I could see the hopelessness on her face. I went away and got some diapers from the other mothers, and gave her a sweater of mine. After the woman and her son had changed their clothes, I sat with her, holding her hand, trying to provide some support and comfort. I could feel her pain and her love for her baby son. During that time, I kept thinking of my children who were waiting for me in New York.\n    Once we landed, I walked with them to their next flight, which would take them to their final destination. The woman thanked me a lot, and I replied, \"Thank you, too.\" At this moment, I couldn't wait to return home to see my children.", "id": "high19418.txt"}
