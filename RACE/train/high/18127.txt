Her mind kept going back to the geography lesson Mr. Kearney gave just two weeks before she flew to Thailand with her family. \n\"The water was swelling and kept coming in,\" said Tilly's mother. \"There was froth on it like you get on the top of a beer.\"\nThe Smiths were celebrating Christmas at Maikhao Beach in southern Thailand. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. There had been an earthquake not far away earlier that morning. \nThe beach was getting smaller and smaller. Tilly's parents felt strange but they didn't know what was happening. Then Tilly said she'd just studied this at school. She told her parents that a tsunami was coming. In the end she screamed at everyone to get off the beach. Tilly's parents even didn't know what a tsunami was. Seeing their daughter so frightened, they thought that something serious must have been happening. Her parents soon took her and her seven-year-old sister back to the hotel. Many other tourists also left the beach with them.\nThe family stayed on the third floor of their hotel. Fortunately, the hotel wasn't destroyed during the tsunami.\nTilly's mother said that if they had stayed on the beach, they wouldn't have survived. \nAfter the disaster, the Smiths met people from nearby resorts who had lost their whole families. More than 100 people were saved because of Tilly's warning.", "id": "high18127.txt"}
