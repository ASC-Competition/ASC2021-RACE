The door hadn't been opened as long as she had lived there. The dirty yard outside was overgrown with weeds  . Maria liked to look at the weeds. Small flowers would grow, followed by seed balls. And the seed carriers would fly away.\n    The late afternoon sunlight died into night. Turning on the light, Maria picked up her color1ed pencils and notepaper. She worked on a picture of a clearing in a forest.\n    \"Maria!\" called her father, who knew where to find her. \"I'm back!\" He had been working at the apartments next door.\n    \"Did you fix their broken blender, Papa?\" She asked, and he said, \"Yes.\" He pushed his daughter's wheelchair into the kitchen so that she could help him prepare dinner. Maria cut up the vegetables that Papa had grown in the small yard behind the house. She loved their bright color1s, their strange shapes, and their fresh, crispy taste before being cooked. She would have loved to garden herself, but it was hard for her to sit on the ground and work.\n    As they ate and talked about their day, Papa told Maria that his brother, Ramon, would be coming over the next day to help him with a special project. Papa had asked Mr. Yamato, the bus driver, to take her to Aunt Gabriela' s house after school. Then Papa would pick her up when the project was finished. Maria wondered why she had to be away while he worked. There was something in Papa's eyes and in his voice, perhaps -that told her not to ask.\n    When Papa brought her home the next evening, he asked her to close her eyes while he took her to the glass door. She heard him open the curtain. Then he said, \"Open your eyes.\"\n    Surely she was dreaming! The tall crowd of weeds was gone. In its place was a beautiful garden. There were young trees, flowery bushes, and color1ful little flowers. Papa opened the glass door. He wheeled Maria to a path that placed her at the heart of the little garden. Then she saw the best part. Along the house were raised wooden beds of soil, just waiting to be planted - by her! They were exactly the right height for her to reach from her wheelchair.\n    \"First I'll draw a plan,\" she said excitedly.\n    \"And then we'll go to the garden center,\" said Papa. \"You're a gardener now, Maria!\"", "id": "high21755.txt"}
