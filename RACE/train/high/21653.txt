The pairs of students had to talk over the problem either face to face or by computers.Dr.Johnson said, \"They told their partners four times as much about themselves when they talked over the Internet as when they talked face to face.When the computers were fitted with cameras so that students could see each other, this limited the personal side of the conversation.\" \nGenerally the information was not extremely personal.It was mainly about things such as where they went to school, or where they used to live.But some students discussed their love stories, and personal childhood experiences.\nDr.Johnson believes that emailing encourages people to focus on themselves.And when they do this, they become more open , especially if there are no cameras.\"If you cannot see the other person, it becomes easier to talk about yourself.This is because you are not thinking what the other person is thinking of you.So emailing has become the modern way of talking.\" said Dr.Johnson.However, this style of talking is not entirely new.\"In the 19th century people started to use the 'telegraph' to communicate.Now the same kind of thing has happened and people ended up speaking more freely.\"\nDr.Johnson thinks that e-mailers need to know about these effects of emailing, especially when they start work in a company.\"If you don't know about it, you could find yourself saying more about yourself than you wanted to .\"", "id": "high21653.txt"}
