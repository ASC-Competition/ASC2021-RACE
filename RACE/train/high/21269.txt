She managed to whisper the word \"bear\" to her rescuer. The girl suffered serious head, neck and leg wounds. Now she is in a dangerous condition in hospital.\nThe girl was taking part in a 24-hour race through Bicentennial Park in Alaska when she was attacked by the bear. Bicentennial Park is next to Chugach State Park where some wild animals live. \n    The animal attacked the girl in a heavily wooded area at about 1:30 am. The girl called emergency services but she was unable to say any word. Another rider Peter Basinger found her lying unconscious on the ground. He told the Anchorage Daily News that she managed to say the word \"bear\" when he stopped to help. Her helmet had been ripped off   in the attack and rolled into the woods. Mr. Basinger waited with the girl for about 20 minutes until doctors arrived. Armed police trekked   \n3 km with doctors to pick up the girl. \n    Animal expert Rick Sinnott said something must be done as soon as possible to prevent the bear from attacking people again. \"It was extremely terrifying,\" he said. \n    Mr. Sinnott told the Anchorage Daily News that the bear might be a mother. It hurt two runners on a nearby path two weeks ago. He also said that the girl was lucky to have been wearing a bike helmet because the bear had bitten her head several times.", "id": "high21269.txt"}
