The gate of the school is artistic . When you go through the main gate,you can see a high stadium  on the left side of the road, which has a 400-meter runaway and a soccer field with green grass. Buildings are tall and beautiful. The library is the most attractive building on the right side of the main road. There are many green trees and colorful flowers on both sides of the roads. The classrooms are amazing. They are big, clean and bright. In each classroom, there is a computer and a big screen,through which our teachers can show us tests,photos, and so on.\nIn my class, there are 60 students. We don't know each other, but we are all friendly.Everyone has a smile on his/her face. When we meet, we always say \"Hello\"to each other.\nMost of our teachers are young. Some students think young teachers cannot teach well, but I do not think so. In my opinion,young teachers are very energetic and easy to make friends with. What's more, they may have a lot of new teaching methods.\nI love my new school very much. I hope, in my new school, I can learn more from my teachers and make progress together with my classmates.", "id": "high1878.txt"}
