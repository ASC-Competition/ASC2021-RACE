The study was carried out by CITV to start their new children's show Bookaboo,which is designed to encourage anyone to pick up a book and read with their children at any time of the day.\nWorryingly,the study showed that only three percent of fathers now find the time to read to the kids compared to 89 percent of mothers. Lucy Goodman,creator of Bookaboo,said,\"It's important for young boys to be able to share a book with dads,granddads or male carers and it can be fun and rewarding,too.\" Of the dads who said they didn't read to their kids, 87 percent blamed work while more than a third said they were too tired. While 89 percent of mums said they did read to their children,more than half of them said cleaning distracted   them and 49 percent were distracted by other household things.\n   Researchers also found parents are now relying heavily on other people to lend a hand with reading to their children with grandparents doing the most,followed by sisters and brothers,aunts and uncles. While 95 percent of parents read to their children at some point,only five percent read to their children during the day. More than one in ten said they read every couple of weeks or less,and five percent could not remember the last time they shared a book.\nThe study found parents also seem content with allowing their children to immerse   themselves in TV programs or playing computer games rather than reading.\nExgoalkeeper David Seaman,who is a dad of two,has been a guest in Bookaboo. He says,\"I think it's important that fathers do read to their children because it's a special time. Sometimes my two children will come to listen to the same book--it's a magical moment and I advise fathers just to try it.\"", "id": "high22177.txt"}
