Coming through!\"\nAt the same time, an oversized man pulling an oversized carry-on turned down our row. His wheeled bag caught the foot of the German maa Turning to see what snagged his luggage ,the American bellower yanked his bag hard enough that it crossed over the man's feet It was then that my horror struck. There was no \"I'm sorry; no \"Excuse me\" 5 no \"Pardon me\" coming from this countryman of mine.\nWhile this wasn't the first or last incident where I sighted impolite, ill-mannered, rude Americans in China, each produced similar feelings. First, I was embarrassed that someone from my country was creating a negative impression of Americans. My second reaction was a desire to apologize. I wanted to explain to the ChiiKse woman and her child, the German couple next to her, and everyone nearby that this was not typical American behavior. I wanted them to know \"we\" were all not like that\nI never got to explain, or to apologize. Language differences made that option impossible, and rational thinking made it inappropriate. But there turned out not to be a need The German man caught my eye and with a bit of head-shaking, smiling and eye rolling* which I returned, it was clear he knew we were Americans and was expressing that there was \"no need\" to apologize for \"universal idiot behavior\".", "id": "high22714.txt"}
