I had been Joe's _ for four years.\nOne evening, Joe and I were sitting in the village inn. A stranger came in, a big, tall man, with heavy eyebrows. The man had large, very clean white hands. To my surprise, I recognized the man. I had seen him at Miss Havisham's many years before. He had frightened me then. He frightened me a little now.\n'I think there is a blacksmith here----name of Joe Gargery,' the man said in his loud voice.\n'That's me!' Joe answered. He stood up.\n'You have an apprentice, known as Pip,' the stranger went on. 'Where is he? '\n'Here!' I cried, standing beside Joe.\n'I wish to speak to you both. I wish to speak to you privately, not here,' the man said. 'Perhaps I could go home with you.'\nWe walked back to the workshop in silence. When we were in the sitting room, the man began to speak.\n'My name is Jaggers,' he said. 'I am a lawyer in London, where I am well-known. I have some unusual business with young Pip here. I am speaking for someone else, you understand. A client who doesn't want to be named. Is that clear?'\nJoe and I nodded.\n'I have come to take your apprentice to London,' the lawyer said to Joe. 'You won't stop him from coming I hope?'\n'Stop him? Never! ' Joe cried.\n'Listen, then. I have this message for Pip. He has ---- great expectations!'\nJoe and I looked at each other, too surprised to speak.\n'Yes, great expectations' Mr. Jaggers repeated. 'Pip will one day be rich, very rich. Pip is to change his way of life at once. He will no longer be a blacksmith. He is to come with me to London. He is to be educated as a gentleman. He will be a man of property.'\nAnd so, at last, my dream had come true. Miss Havisham----because Mr. Jaggers' client must be Miss Havisham----had plans for me after all. I would be rich and Estella would love me!\nMr. Jaggers was speaking again. 'There are two conditions,' he said, looking at me. 'First, you will always be known as Pip. Secondly,' Mr. Jaggers continued, 'the name of your benefactor is to be kept secret. One day, that person will speak to you, face to face. Until then, you must not ask any questions. You must never try to find out this person's name. Do you understand? Speak out!'\n'Yes, I understand,' I answered. 'My benefactor's name is to remain a secret.'\n'Good,' Mr. Jaggers said. 'Now, Pip, you will come into your property when you come of age----when you are twenty-one. Until then, I am your guardian. I have money to pay for your education and to allow you to live as a gentleman. You will have a private teacher. His name is Mr. Matthew Pocket and you will stay at his house.'\nI gave a cry of surprise. Some of Miss Havisham's relations were called Pocket. Mr. Jaggers raised his eyebrows.\n'Do you not want to live with Mr. Pocket? Have you any objection to this arrangement?' he said severely.\n'No, no, none at all,' I answered quickly.\n'Good. Then I will arrange everything,' Mr. Jaggers went on. 'Mr. Pocket's son has rooms in London. I suggest you go there. Now when can you come to London?'\nI looked at Joe.\n'At once, if Joe has no objection,' I said.\n'No objection, Pip old chap,' Joe answered.\n'Then you will come in one week's time,' Mr. Jaggers said, standing up. 'You will need new clothes. Here is some money to pay for them. Twenty guineas.'\nHe counted the money and put it on the table.\n'Well, Joe Gargery, you are saying nothing,' Mr. Jaggers said to Joe firmly. 'I have money to give to you too.'", "id": "high15226.txt"}
