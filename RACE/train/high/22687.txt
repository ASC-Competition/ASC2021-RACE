No. You Wouldn't!\nWhen an adult, sits in a car for any length of time, we stretch, we change the position, we move our legs, and shift constantly. We do this automatically, and without thinking. But kids in a traditional car seat can't do this. They are stuck in one position, and they can't move. We move because the circulation  of blood needs to be restored in our legs as we sit in the same position for any extended length of time.\nIn a traditional car seat, the child can't move to reduce the pain, so it pts them in a bad mood.\nThe FreedomRide lets them have a little freedom, and still be safe. The 5-point Harness give them additional safety over a traditional child car seat.\nI am the Webmaster for islandbreeze.com, and when JoeySafe asked us to redo their web site, I was attracted by this system. That is because I have two small children, both girls, age 3 and 4 and we obviously, use car seats. I lived in Southern California, and every couple of months, my wife, the girls and I, go to see grandma who lives in Nevada. It's a 5-hour drive, so the FreedomRide works well. Our trips are so much better now, especially, since there is more room in the car without the car seats.\nThe FreedomRide really did make it easier to go on trips. The only thing you need when you use the Joeysafe instead of your old child seat is a pillow. Besides, mu kids want to take a pillow anyway! As a dad, I feel safe driving with the kids in the FreedomRide. I am a very safety oriented  person.", "id": "high22687.txt"}
