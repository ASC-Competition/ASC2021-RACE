Once he gave some food to a poor woman . Mr White, the boss of the restaurant, found it and became angry. He often gave the leftovers  to  some poor workers. Mr. Backers lost his work for it. It was difficult for him to find work in the small country though he was an able cook. The war made all stop. Children couldn't go  to school, most shops were closed, even some farmers were  hungry. Some people were made to leave their houses and they had to find the safe places. It was an autumn night. Mr Backer  hadn't any food to eat and went to bed, but he couldn't fall asleep, because he was very hungry . suddenly he heard a noise in  his room. He saw a man looking for something useful there. He said nothing and watched it carefully. At last the man took a few old clothes out of a broken paper box and took them away. He got up from his bed quickly and followed him gently , with his _ on his back. The man didn't find him and went into a small and wet house. Mr. Backer also went in and saw there was nothing in the room. The thief  saw him and was surprised. He asked, \"What did you come here for?\" \"You have carried my things here,\" said Mr. Backer. \"I have to move here, too!\"", "id": "high5256.txt"}
