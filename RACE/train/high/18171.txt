Or perhaps you've watched TV programs about how lonely older people can get. \nSo what can you do about any of those things? The answer: You can volunteer. Volunteering gives you an opportunity to change people's lives, including your own. Helping others in need is such an important part of the American way of life that many high schools require their students to spend a certain number of hours volunteering in order to graduate.\nVolunteering isn't like school: Instead of having the choices made for you about where to go and what subjects to learn,you can choose what really interests you and who (or what) is most deserving of your time. \n    If you like animals, help out at a local animal shelter. Most shelters depend on volunteers to keep the cats and dogs happy and well exercised. \n    If you have a friend or   who has or had a medical problem(like cancer,HIV,for example), you might be inspired to donate your time to help an organization that raises money for research, delivers meals,or offers other help to people with the illness. \n    If you like children,there are lots of volunteering opportunities--from being a Big Brother or Big Sister to helping out in an after-school sports program. \n    You also can: serve food at a homeless shelter; take part in a park cleanup day. \n    And if you have more than one thing you love,you can combine the two. For example,if you love kids and are great at arts and crafts , visit your local children's hospital and offer to lead art activities for young patients.", "id": "high18171.txt"}
