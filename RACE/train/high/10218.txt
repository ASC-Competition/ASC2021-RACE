Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log.\n\"While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,\" he said.\nThe bottom line is that a robot creates a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a character on the screen.\nAutom is expected to go on sale later this year in the United States for around $500.A robot which speaks and understands Cantonese and Mandarin in addition to English according to the demands is also being developed.", "id": "high10218.txt"}
