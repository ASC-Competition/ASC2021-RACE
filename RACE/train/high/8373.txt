They found big meat eaters had a raised risk of death from all causes over a 10-year period. In contrast, a higher intake of white meat was associated with a slightly reduced risk of death over the same period.\nThe US study, based on more than 500,000 people, found those whose diet contained the highest proportion   of red or processed meat had a higher overall risk of death, and specifically a higher risk of cancer and heart disease than those who ate the least.\nPeople eating the most meat were eating about 160g of red or processed meat per day-- approximately a 6oz steak. Those who ate the least were only getting about 25g per day-- approximately a small piece of bacon. Just the opposite, those who ate the highest proportion of white meat had a lower risk of overall death, and a lower risk of fatal cancer or heart disease than those who ate the lowest proportion.\nMeat is a major source of saturated   fat, which has been associated with breast and colorectal cancer. In addition, lower meat intake has been linked to a reduction in risk factors for heart disease, including lower blood pressure and cholesterol   levels. The latest study adds to a growing body of research linking high red and processed meat consumption to an increased risk of ill health. Ed Yong, of the charity Cancer Research UK, said, \"Evidence from large studies tells us that cutting down on processed food, such as bacon or burgers, can reduce the risk of dying from cancer and other diseases.\"\nDr Barry Popkin of the University of North Carolina stressed there were health benefits from eating some red meat. But he added: \"The need is for a major reduction in total meat intake, an even larger reduction in processed meat and other highly processed and salted animal source food products and a reduction in total saturated fat.\" Dr Mark Wahlqvist, a nutrition expert from Australia, said eating small amounts of red meat--around 30g a day--provided a good source of key nutrients. He said, \"Fresh, lean red meat of these amounts is likely to be of more benefit than harm.\"", "id": "high8373.txt"}
