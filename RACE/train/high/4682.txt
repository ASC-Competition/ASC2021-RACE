I'm hungry.\"\nKent looked through the doors that led into the hallway. \"I think Ms. Milano and Mr.Hasselbach just finished giving _ the garden touring. They should be heading into the cafeteria next.\"\nThe students of Jefferson Middle School in Saint Louis, US had spent all afternoon preparing for the evening meal. They did their best to transform the lunchroom into a beautiful dining area for their families.\nAs the families found their seats, Ms. Milano asked Drew, Emilio, and Michi to join her at the front of the room. She said, \"I just wanted to take a moment to congratulate Drew, Emilio and Michi for their wonderful idea. A year ago, they first came to me with the plan for starting a garden at Jefferson. I wondered whether it would work, but they had thought through everything. Any time I had a question about how we would make this work, they had an answer prepared. As you can see, they were absolutely correct. About three-quarters of the food you will be enjoying came from the school garden. The students prepared the entire meal themselves.\"\nMs. Milano handed Drew, Michi and Emilio a box each. They opened their box as Ms. Milano continued. \"As a thank-you to these students for their creative idea and hard work, they have each received a stepping stone for the garden. Their names and date appear on the stones.\"\nShe turned to them. \"Students for years to come will be enjoying the garden that you helped create,\" she said. \"We thought it would be appropriate for them to have a reminder of our garden's founders.\"\nThey held up their stepping stones and smiled as the crowd clapped. \"And now,\" said Ms Milano, \"please help yourself to some of the mouthwatering food our young chefs have prepared. Dinner is served!\"", "id": "high4682.txt"}
