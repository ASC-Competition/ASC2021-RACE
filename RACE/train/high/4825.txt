Is that enough to take a look.\"\n\"Sure,\" said the farmer. Then he called his dog, \"Here, Dolly!\"\nOut from the doghouse and down the ramp  ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.\nAs the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else moving inside the doghouse. Slowly, another little ball appeared. This one was much smaller than the others. Down the ramp it slid . Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling  toward the others, doing its best to catch up...\n\"I want that one,\" the little boy said, pointing to the slow dog.\nThe farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, \"Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs will.\"\nWith that the little boy stepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of trousers. There was a steel brace  running down both sides of his leg. It was joined to a specially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, \"You see, sir, I don't run very well myself, and he will need someone who understands.\"\nThe world is full of people who need someone who understands.", "id": "high4825.txt"}
