Our reporter Mary Owen met him at his home in south prefix = st1 /Londonand he told her all about the trip.\nReporter: What gave you the idea to travel around Indiaon an elephant, Chris?\nChris: Well, it all started 2 years ago when I was planning a trip to India. I visited a photographic exhibition of elephants and I realized that the only way to travel is on an elephant.\nReporter: What did you do next?\nChris: I flew to New Delhiand started looking for an elephant. I needed an elephant trained to    carry people. I didn't know anything about elephants, so I asked an expert for help. He taught me how to ride an elephant. He also helped me find an elephant.\nReporter: Can you tell me about the journey?\nChris: Well. I bought a female elephant called Tara for about $ 6000. We set off from New Delhia week later. We were heading to Sonepur in northernIndiawhere there is a big elephant market and I could sell Tara easily. And what a ride! Elephants can travel at about 6 miles an hour and Sonepur was more than 1,200 kim away. The journey took us 64 days!\nReporter: Did you have any problems on your journey?\nChris: Yes, a few. But nothing serious. On the third day, Tara hurt her foot. But that got better quickly. Also there was a log of heavy rain during the first week and we got very wet!\nReporter: What happened when you reached Sonepur?\nChris: My plan was to sell Tara. But by now I was very fond of her. I couldn't take her back to Britainand I didn't want to sell her at the market. By chance,I met some people who wanted an elephant for their national park. I knew that Tara would be safe with them, so I gave her to them. I was very sad to say goodbye.", "id": "high18124.txt"}
