There are dozens of strange terms to describe the \"@\" symbol.\nBefore it became the standard symbol for electronic mail, the \"@\" symbol was used to represent the cost of something or how heavy something is. For instance, if you purchased 6 apples, you might write it as 6 apples \"@\" $1.10 each.\nWith the introduction of e-mail came the popularity of the \"@\" symbol. The \"@\" symbol or the \"at sign\" separates a person's online user name from his mail server  address. For instance, joe@uselessknowledge.com. Its widespread use on the Internet made it necessary to put this symbol on keyboards in other countries that have never seen or used the symbol before. As a result, there is really no official name for this symbol.\nThe actual origin of the symbol remains a mystery. History tells us that the @ symbol came from the tired hands of the Middle Ages. During the Middle Ages before the invention of printing machines, every letter of a word had to be copied with great efforts by hand for each copy of a published book. The monks that performed these long, boring coping duties looked for ways to reduce the number of individual strokes   per word for common words. Although the word \"at\" is quite short to begin with, it was a common enough word in text and documents so that those monks thought it would be quicker and easier to shorten the word \"at\" even more. As a result, the monks changed the shape of \"t\" into a circle to surround \"a\", thus leaving out two strokes in the spelling \"t\".", "id": "high20163.txt"}
