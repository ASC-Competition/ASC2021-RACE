The seemingly harmless items have been responsible for more than 13 million crashes and near misses on Britain's roads.\nWhile men were responsible for the greater number of accidents reported, women played their part by driving in high heels. Putting fashion over function meant 44 percent of female motorists had been prevented from using the pedals correctly by their high heels--with those aged 25 to 34 accounting for most of the incidents reported.\nThose keen for a caffeine kick while driving can also create an accident if they leave empty coffee cups lying around their vehicle. Twenty percent of those surveyed admitted they had crashed their car or had a near miss after a deserted coffee cup or empty drink bottle rolled under their brake pedal .\nHowever, it is not just wearing and eating that cause a threat from inside the car, man's best friend could also cause a catastrophe if not safely secured.

The survey has found drivers will pick up an average bill of PS261.47 for the damage caused by every crash. Londoners were the most at risk of an accident closely followed by motorists in the West Midland and Wales.\nJanet Connor, a managing director, said many accidents could be avoided if people cleaned their cars regularly, as one in ten drivers involved in crashes admitted to driving inside a mountain of debris. She said, \"The possible dangers and distractions outside the car are well known but as the evidence suggests, those within the car are often forgotten.\"", "id": "high17963.txt"}
