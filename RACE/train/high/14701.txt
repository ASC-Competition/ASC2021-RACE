I was on the side of the road for about four hours with my big jeep. I put signs in the windows that said, \"Need a jack  .\"\nAs I was about to give up,a truck stopped and a man got off. He looked at the situation, made a judgment and went back to take a jack. After about two hours, we finished the job with sweats. We were both dirty. His wife took a large bottle of water for us to wash our hands.\nI tried to put $ 20 in the man's hand, but he wouldn't take it, so I went to give it to his wife as quietly as I could. I asked their little girl where they lived, thinking maybe Pd send them a gift. She said they lived in Mexico. They were in Oregon now,so Mommy and Daddy could pick cherries for the next few weeks. After that, they were going to pick peaches and then go back home.\nAfter I said goodbye and started going back to my jeep, the girl ran to me and handed me a tamale  for lunch. I thanked them again and walked back to my jeep. When I opened the tamale, what did I find inside? My $ 20! I ran to the truck and the guy rolled down his window. He started shaking his head, smiled, and with what looked like great concentration said in English, \"Today you, tomorrow me. \" Then he drove away, with his daughter waving to me from the back.\nThis family, working on a seasonal basis where time is money, took a couple of hours to help a stranger while others passed by quietly.\nSince then I've helped many people like the Mexican family. I didn't accept their money. Every time I was able to help,I felt as if I was putting something in the bank.", "id": "high14701.txt"}
