That means warm soil, proper night temperatures and no risk of a sudden reversion to winter.\nI no longer believe in settled weather. In the current age of climate confusion, a backup plan is always an essential part of a gardener's intention for an ideal tomato harvest.\nWhere tomatoes are concerned, the best crop insurance is to root some extras from cuttings . It can take a couple of months to grow garden-ready tomato plants from seed , but cuttings can be ready to go in a few weeks. Yes, you could pick up some starts at a garden center, but it's hard to find strong ones in good condition.\nInstead, buy one tomato plant, and turn it into many. Tomatoes root very quickly and easily. All you do is remove a tiny branch about 6 inches tall off the main stem , carefully cut off all but the top two leaves, plant the tiny branch in a pot, and wait.    \nRoots will emerge along the stem and new growth will soon appear if kept damp, warm and out of direct sunlight.\nIf you have never rooted stem cuttings before, you will have gained not only a tomato crop but also a skill that you can now apply to other plants in your garden, both edible and ornamental . Tomato  s such as peppers and eggplants can be similarly rooted, as can many herbs, especially those in the mint family.", "id": "high18280.txt"}
