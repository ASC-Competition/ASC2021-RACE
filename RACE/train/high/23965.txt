Americans get a lot of entertainment and information from TV. Most people probably watch it for entertainment only. For some people, however, TV is where they get the news of the day. But some new TV programs or shows put entertainment and news together. \nThis new kind of program in the United States is called \"infotainment\", which means information (info-) and entertainment (-tainment). These kinds of programs use actors to act out news stories, making the news of the day more interesting and exciting to people. The shows also use special effects. \nAn example of infotainment is the show \"America's Most Wanted\". The producers of this program get stories from real cases that the police have dealt with. In most of these cases, the police never found the person who committed the crime . Sometimes they caught the criminal, but he or she ran away again.
