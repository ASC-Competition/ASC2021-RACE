It has 17,508. But in recent years, the popular tourist destination has lost some of its shine.\n   Due to rising sea levels caused by global warming, 24 Indonesian islands have gone under the sea. Scientists say 2,000 more will disappear before 2030. In the past three years, the southeast Asian nation also witnessed its islands destroyed by a tsunami  and typhoons.\n   \"If no measures are taken to fight climate change, the beautiful islands will go forever.\" scientists told environmental ministers from about 190 countries at a UN climate change meeting.\n   This week they are meeting in Bali, an Indonesian islands. They are trying to reach a deal to cut the world's emissions  of CO2, which makes the earth warmer.\nIndonesia is not alone. This year has been more  _  hit the world.Canadaand US suffered heavy storms and typhoons, While Australians were caught in the heaviest drought in a century.\nIn China, the average temperature this year went up by 1.2degC from last year, reaching the highest on record since 1951. From Jiangxi and Hunan in the south to Heilongjiang andJilinin the northeast , one -third of farmland has suffered from a drought.\nHowever, other parts of the country got too much rain. More than 700 people were killed in floods, landslides  and storms. \"These weather extreme are the more obvious effects of global warming,\" said Song Lianchun, a climate expert.\nScientists say time is running out. To escape from the worst effects, global CO2 emissions need to be cut from the levels they were at in 2000 by 50 to 85 percent by 2050.\nBut in recent years climate change talks have been bogged down by arguments over  who will pay the bill for cleaner technology. Developing countries are worried that the cut in emissions will slow their economic development.\n\"Chinawill play a responsible and constructive role in the meeting,\" said Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. The nation is now the world's second largest greenhouse gas emitter  .\"However, developed nations should help developing nations deal with the global issue.\"", "id": "high24174.txt"}
