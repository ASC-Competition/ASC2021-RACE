He used his time between classes at Alabama A&M to reach a goal of mowing 100 yards before winter. Smith has been cutting grass for free to help single moms, the elderly, and the disabled, while teaching the local youth the values that can turn boys into men. \"I'm doing something positive. I want boys to follow me and be better than me,\" he wrote on his Facebook page.\nRodney is from Bermuda. He says people there help each other and are always friendly. \"That's what drives me to help people.\"\nIn May this year, he was getting ready to _ his mowing service for the summer when he heard about a 93-year-old woman trying to cut grass by herself. Smith and a friend showed up to do the job for her.\nIn November, a local TV station gave him $300, calling it a special gift for his good work. After he received the money, he used it to create the non-profit  service group, Raising Men Lawn Care Service. He also started a page to collect money to buy lawn equipment and other things--including T-shirts with special logos.\nAfter I read about Rodney's story, I told my friends about him. We also planned to mow lawns for single moms, the elderly and disabled in our neighborhood. And I hope more and more young people will join Rodney's service group--Raising Men Lawn Care Service.", "id": "high14808.txt"}
