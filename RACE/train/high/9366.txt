He thought he saw something. Then he slowed down, watching out for children rushing out from between parked cars. As his car passed, no kids appeared. Instead, a brick smashed into his door! He slammed on the brakes (make his car stop). The angry driver then jumped out of his car, caught the nearest child and pushed him up against a parked car, shouting, \"Who are you and what was that all about?\"\nThe little boy was full of apology, \"Please,Mister... Please, I'm sorry...I didn't know what else I could do. I threw the brick because no one else would stop.\"\nWith tears dripping down his face, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car. \"It's my brother,\" he said. \"He fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up.\"\nNow weeping, the boy asked the executive, \"Would you please help me to get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me.\"\nTouched beyond words, the executive tried to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. He hurriedly lifted the boy back into the wheelchair, then took out his fancy handkerchief and dabbed (a light touch) at the fresh scrapes and cuts. A quick look told him everything was going to be okay. \"Thank you and may God bless you.\" The grateful child told the stranger.\nShaken up for words, the man simply watched the little boy push his wheelchair-bound brother down the sidewalk toward their home.\nGod whispers in our souls and speaks to our hearts. Sometimes when we don't have time to listen, he has to throw a brick at us. Don't go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at you to get your attention!", "id": "high9366.txt"}
