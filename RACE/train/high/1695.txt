When there is money enough to satisfy one level of wants, another level appears.\nThe first and most basic level of wants is food. Once this want is satisfied, a second level of wants appears: clothing and some sort of shelter. By the end of World War II these wants were satisfied for a great majority of Americans. Then a third level appeared. It included such items as cars and new houses.\nBy 1957 or 1958 this third level of wants was fairly well satisfied. Then in the late 1950s a fourth level of wants appeared: the \"life-enriching\" level. While the other levels mean physical satisfaction--the feeding, comfort, safety and transportation of the human body--this level means mental needs for recognition, achievement and happiness, It includes a variety of goods and  services many of which could be called \"luxury\" items. Among them are vacation trips, the best medical care and entertainment. Also included here are fancy foods and the latest styles in clothing.\nOn the fourth level, a greater percentage of consumers spending goes to services, while on the first three levels more is spent on goods. Will consumers raise their sights to a fifth level of wants as their income increases, or will they continue to demand luxuries and personal services on the fourth level?\nA fifth level probably would be wants that can be achieved by community action. Consumers may be spending more on taxes and crime. After filling our stomachs, our garages, and our minds, we now may seek to ensure the health and safety to enjoy more fully the good things on the first three levels.", "id": "high1695.txt"}
