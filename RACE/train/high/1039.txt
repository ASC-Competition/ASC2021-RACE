I have always wanted to be a Grand Slam   champion.\"\nThese are the words of Chinese tennis player Li Na after she became the first Asian woman to win a Grand Slam final in the French Open on June 4.\n\"People were saying I'm getting old. So this is a great success for such an old woman,\" the 29-year-old joked.\nThis is the way that Li usually fights doubts- by being humorous and sharp. \"China's number one sister\" is never a pushover  .\nShe has a tattoo  . She has dyed   her hair many different colors. And, at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she told her fans to \"shut up\" when they got too noisy in their support.\nLi started to play tennis at the age of 6. She once recalled: \"As a child, I felt sad because every day I had to wake up early to practice. After school I had to practice more. I didn't have time to play.\"\nLuckily, the tough girl didn't give up, thus making history for Chinese tennis time after time.\nNow the new champion is already thinking about winning another Grand Slam title. Her next stop is Wimbledon - the European grass court championship that starts later this month.\n\"When you have one title, naturally you will think about another,\" she says, not hiding her ambition.\n\"Chinese people are so lacking in confidence on the tennis court. If there is a person like me who can prove we can do it, the other young players in China will feel the same,\" she said.", "id": "high1039.txt"}
