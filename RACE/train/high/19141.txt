Far removed from his comfortable home in Australia, he traveled to the Philippines with an aid organization that set him up with a host family. Their home was in Smokey Mountain, a teeming slum  in Manila.\nA boy in the family, Sonny Boy, was the same age as Evans. The difference between their lives shocked him hard. \"I believed that I wanted to commit my life to this,\" said Evans. \"I want to see an end to extreme poverty in my lifetime.\"\nIt's the same goal shared by global organizations and world leaders, and some great progress has been made in reducing the number of the world's poorest. In 1981, about half the developing world lived in extreme poverty. By 2010, it had fallen to about 20 percent. The organization has set 2030 as the goal to reduce the rate even further, to 3 percent.\nThe gains worldwide are unbalanced. China and Southeast Asia have made huge progress in lifting their populations above that line. But the opposite is true in some areas in Africa. Even though economic growth is developing across the continent, the number of extremely poor people actually increased over the last three decades.\nThe organization's campaign, \"Live Below the Line\", hoped for an even greater effect by actually having people eat the way that the world's poorest have to do every day.\nThis year about 15,000 people worldwide joined in the campaign such as Ben Affleck and Josh Groban, as well as other notables, such as Jill Biden and Hunter Biden, the vice president's son. The campaign will raise up to $4,000,000 for various aid organizations working to help the world's poorest.", "id": "high19141.txt"}
