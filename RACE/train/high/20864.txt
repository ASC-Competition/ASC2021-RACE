He makes his case in a new book. Listening for meaning in a World of Noise. Here he explain himself (using his voice);\n     \"We've become so accustomed to noise, there's almost a deep prejudice against the idea that silence might be beneficial, if you tell someone to be quiet ,you sound like an old man. But it's never been important to find continuing quiet. Silence focuses us, improves our health, and is a key to lasting peace and satisfaction.\"\n\"We need to excite people about the sounds you start to hear, if you merely quiet things down a little.
