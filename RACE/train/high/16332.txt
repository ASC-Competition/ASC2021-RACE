It received a cautious welcome from some in the arts world, who expressed concern that the tickets may not reach the most underprivileged.\nThe plan comes as West End theatres are enjoying record audiences, thanks largely to musicals teaming up with television talent shows. Attendances reached. 13.6 million in 2007, up 10 percent on 2006, itself a record year. Total sales were up 18 percent on 2006 to almost PS470 million.\nOne theatre source criticised the Government's priorities  in funding free tickets when pensioners were struggling to buy food and fuel, saying: \"I don't know why the Government's wasting money on this. The Yong Vic, as\nreported today, offers excellent performances at cheap prices.\"\nThere was praise for the Government's plan from Dominic Cooke of the Royal Court Theatre, who said: \"I support any move to get young people into theatre, and especially one that aims to do it all over England, not just in   London.\"\nNinety-five publicly funded theatres could apply for funding under the two-year plan. In return, they will offer free tickets on at least one day each week to 18 to 26-year-olds, first-come, first-served. It is likely to be on Mondays, traditionally a quiet night for the theatre.\nMr. Burnham said: \"A young person attending the theatre can find it an exciting experience, and be inspired to explore a new world. But sometimes people miss out on it because they fear it's 'not for them'. It's time to change this perception.\"\nJeremy Hunt, the Shadow Culture Secretary, said: \"The real issue is not getting enthusiastic children into the theatre, but improving arts education so that more young people want to go in the first place. For too many children theatres are a no-go area.\"", "id": "high16332.txt"}
