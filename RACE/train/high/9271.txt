I took my problem to the editor-in-chief, and.he said to me:\"Don't worry; you're creative. \"\nI'm not sure where the editor-in-chief reached the conclusion that I was \"creative\". Maybe it was through the poems I wrote. Personally, I simply enjoy writing because it's fun. There's also the fact that I can't draw or do anything else creatively, I'm equally sure that there are people in the boat on the other side who can make things look excellent, but can't write a poem.\nAt this point you probably want to ask me what poetry and art have to do with engineering.  For one, it makes you a more rounded person, making you a better engineer. More importantly, as an engineer, you will be faced with many problems every day. There are some that can be solved by consulting a textbook, but more often than not, you will need that thing in your brain to put together things in a completely original combination to solve the problem at hand.\nThink of the wonderful things that creative engineers have done. Civil engineers have made the road more long-lasting so we don't have to close them for repairs as often. Coming up with a new innovation   is similar to writing a good poem. It's not some-thing you plan to do. The critical moment comes unexpectedly in the middle of nowhere. You don't think about what you're doing, you simply do. After some mad struggling you take a look at the end product and say to yourself, \"This is a masterpiece. \" This is perhaps the greatest personal satisfaction one can\nexperience.\nSo all you engineers out there get out and do something creative. I don't care if it's writing a poem or a computer program, just be natural and do something creative.", "id": "high9271.txt"}
