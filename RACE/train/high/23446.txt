Ray presented her proposal   to build a $2 million wildlife hospital and nature center to environment commissioners   recently. \"What we need is to be able to build a 100-foot-long flight aviary   for hawks that are recovering and to have water pools for recovering water birds,\" Ray said.\n    She hopes they will open by the end of 2010, and will be able to care for oiled birds after more than 50,000 gallons of fuel flowed into the Bay. \n    \"For any animal, whether it is oiled, injured or anything else, getting it immediate care is important to its survival,\" she said.\n    Department employees drive as many as 350 injured animals every year to a wildlife hospital, according to Friedman. He said around 80 percent of those animals are birds.\n    \"It would be wonderful to have a wildlife rehabilitation center   here in San Francisco,\" Friedman said.\n    Ray's proposal includes aviaries as well as a nature education center and outdoor picnic area. She has suggested building the center at Lake Merced or in western Golden Gate Park. A parking lot, soccer field and storage area are presently being planned for construction at the Golden Gate Park site. Any changes to those plans would need to be _ by department commissioners. The Board of Supervisors is also in charge of those plans.", "id": "high23446.txt"}
