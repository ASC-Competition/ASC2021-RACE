He looked thin and hurry. He was hoping to get work in show business. He could sing and dance, and above all, he knew how to make people laugh. But he couldn't get work and therefore wandered about the city streets. Sometimes he was sent away to a home for children who had no parents.\nBut twenty years later, this same Chaplin became the greatest, best-known, and best-loved comedian   in the world. Any regular visitor to the cinema, must have seen some of Charlie Chaplin's films. People everywhere have sat and laughed at them until the tears ran down their faces. Even people who don't understand English can enjoy his films, because they are mostly silent. It isn't what he says that makes us laugh. His comedy doesn't depend upon   words or language. It depends upon little actions which mean the thing to people all over the word. Acting out without words, of common human situations plays an important part in the dances and plays in many countries. It's a kind of the world language.\nChaplin lived most of his life in America and died in Switzerland on Christmas Day 1977, at the age of eighty-eight. There was sadness all over the world at the news of his death.", "id": "high8392.txt"}
