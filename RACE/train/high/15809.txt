Nothing would settle him down. Guessing that I would have a long night ahead of me, I brought a portable  TV into his room, figuring that watching the late movie was as good a way as any to kill off the hours till dawn. To my surprise, as soon as the TV lit up, the baby quieted right now, his little eyes focused brightly on the tube. Not to waste an opportunity for sleep, I then walked out of the room, leaving him to watch the actors celebrate John Bellushi's forty-fifth birthday.\nMy wife and I heard no more of the baby that night, and the next morning when I went into his room, I found him still watching TV himself. I found in my baby's a metaphor for the new generation. My wife and I had given him some books to examine, but he merely spit upon them. When we read to him, he did not feel comfortable. And so it is in the schools. We find that our students don't read , that they look down upon reading and scold those of us who teach it. All they want to do is watching TV.\nAfter this experience with the baby, however, I have reached a conclusion: \"Let them watch it!\" If television is that much more attractive to children than books, why should we fight it? Let them watch it all they want!", "id": "high15809.txt"}
