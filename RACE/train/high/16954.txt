He planned to call himself the \"Reading Wizard\" and wear a special hat, fake glasses and a black coat.\nBut his idea was refused - on the phone, in person and finally with a letter from Toni Bernardi, the chief of the library's children and youth services. Using terms like \"age appropriate material\" ,she wrote that only library workers are allowed to read to children.\nJohn then went to a member of the city board of supervisors , who advised him to write letters to the library officials.\n\"Our libraries are supposed to turn kids on, not to turn them off.\" Brown said he enjoyed \"the creative idea, the sense of civic duty and the caring for others that John clearly showed us.\"", "id": "high16954.txt"}
