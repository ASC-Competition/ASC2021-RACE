Yale, Princeton, Columbia and Dartmouth were all started before the American Revolution made the thirteen colonies  into states.\nIn the early years, these schools were much alike. Only young men attended colleges. All the students studied the same subjects, and everyone learned Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Little was known about science then, and one kind of school could teach everything that was known about the world. When the students graduated, most of them became ministers or teachers.\nIn 1782, Harvard started a medical school for young men who wanted to become doctors. Later, lawyers  could receive their training in Harvard's law school. In 1852, Harvard began teaching modern languages, such as French and German, as well as Latin and Greek. Soon it began teaching American history.\nAs knowledge increased, Harvard and other colleges began to teach many new subjects that interested them.\nSpecial colleges for women were started. New state universities began to teach such subjects as farming, engineering and business. Today, there are many different kinds of colleges and universities. Most of them are divided into smaller schools that deal with special fields of learning. There is so much to learn that one kind of school cannot offer it all.", "id": "high4828.txt"}
