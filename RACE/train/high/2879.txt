Somebody got too close to my parachute  .\"The parachute below blocked Reed's air and his parachute failed to open. Reed crashed a hundred feet to the ground, breaking his back in five places.\nThe next morning, Reed could not move. \"Doctors said it was likely that I would never walk again.\" Reed stared out of his hospital window, wondering what the future would be like. It was the saddest moment of his life. \"The experts are telling me my body doesn't work! What am I supposed to do?\" he thought.\nTo distract   himself, he picked up a book: Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers. The science-fiction describes a set of man-made muscles that would allow people to carry 2,000 pounds. He thought that if he could build something like that, it might be able to lift him out of his wheelchair. So he began his project and finally succeeded in building a set of robot legs. Several years later, he made an amazing recovery and was able to get up and walk away from his wheelchair. He even jumped out of an airplane again to celebrate.\nReed wanted to do something for others with the second chance that life had given him. He has now perfected the robot legs that can get the injured, the elderly and the paralyzed   out of their wheelchairs. Now he has started his own company to make the legs. \"I've seen them compete in marathons and go swimming and mountain climbing,\" he said. \"So never give up!\"", "id": "high2879.txt"}
