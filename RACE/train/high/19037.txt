Tony Higgins from UCAS  said that the statistics are good news for everyone in higher education. \"Students who take a well-planned year out are more likely to be stisfied with, and complete, their chosen course. Students who take a gap year are often more mature and responsible,\" he said.\nBut not everyone is happy. Owain James, the president of the National Union of Students(NUS), argued that the increase is evidence of student hadship - young people are being forced into earning money before finishing their education. \"New students are now aware that they are likely to leave university up to PS15,000 in debt. It is not surprising that more and More students are taking a gap year to earn money to support their study for the degree.NUS statistics show that over 40% of students are forced to work during  term time and the figure increases to 90% during vacation periods,\"he said.", "id": "high19037.txt"}
