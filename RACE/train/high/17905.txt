Keep Britain Tidy said the rodents  were stopping their traditional hunts underground and were roaming the streets ,tempted by discarded burgers ,pizzas and crisps. \"The rat population is on the rise and soon it'll be as common to see a rodent on our street as it is to see a dog or a cat,\" said group Director ,Sue Nelson. The practice of dumping fast food litter and scraps on the street rather than in the trash-with young men the worst offenders-was behind the rise. According to the National Rodent Survey in 2005, Britain's rat population has grown by nearly one quarter since 2000 and is now estimated at 60 million , two million more than the human population. On average a rat can give birth every 24--28 days and just a single pair of rats can produce a colony of 2,000 a year. Around 200 people a year get Weil's Disease----an infection which can lead to liver or kidney  failure and eventually death and which is arrived in rat's waste. To highlight the issue , Keep Britain Tidy launched a cinema ad entitled \"How close do you want them to get?\" The advertisement gave a shocking image of a young woman sleeping in a bed of rots, echoing the nightmare scene from James Herbert's classic horror tale The Rats, in which mutant rodents begin to prey on humans.", "id": "high17905.txt"}
