The report put forward practical tips that city people can take to reduce their exposure   to city air pollution. Quite a lot, it turns out. \n* Watch where you walk \nAvoid walking along busy streets and thoroughfares  , instead choosing side streets and parks. because pollution levels can fall by a factor of 10 just by moving a few metres away from the main source of the pollution - exhaust fumes. \"\nDon't walk behind smokers, and walk on the windward, side of the street where exposure to pollutants can be 50% less than on the leewardside.  \n* Pavement  sense  \nWhen you're crossing a road, stand well back from the kerb while you wait for the lights to change.

So the air you breathe is dirtier rather than cleaner.", "id": "high22217.txt"}
