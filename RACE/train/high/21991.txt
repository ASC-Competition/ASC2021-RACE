He says that humanity is currently at point of breakthrough in war, like the discovery of the atomic bomb.\n\"What does it mean to go to war with US soldiers whose hardware is made in China and whose software is made in India?\" The research predicts that by 2015 American soldiers will be half robots, half humans.\nIt is worth mentioning that attack drones   and bomb-handling robots are just some of the devices that armies use in battles. Besides having no mercy in battle, robots, in contrast to humans, also cut off living soldiers from horrors.\n\"The United States is ahead in military robots, but in technology there is no such thing as a permanent advantage,\" Mr. Singer said, adding that currently Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran are working on the development of military robots as well. The researcher mentioned that robotics is something terrorists can take advantage of as well.\n\"You don't have to make robots believe they are going to get 7 million dollars when they die to get them to blow themselves up,\" he said.\nIn addition, Mr. Singer mentioned that military robots feature cameras that record everything a machine sees, providing digital video that is uploaded on You Tubein graphic clips, which soldiers call \"war porn\". \"It turns war into entertainment, sometimes set to music. The ability to watch more but experience less,\" he said.\nDavid Hansco, who is a robotics designer, creates robots that have more features of a human. For example, his robots feature synthetic   flesh faces and have the ability to read human facial expressions and copy them. The engineer states that the main idea is to create robots that can show empathy .", "id": "high21991.txt"}
