Little did I know that a Colorado snowstorm would greet me after I had been in my new home for only a week.\nI just missed home. But more than the old house and the beach, I missed Stacey, my best friend. And I missed our lovely tea. Going to a sweet little tearoom, we had discovered was a special treat for us. The place was a Victorian dream, with delicate teacups and tablecloths with flower prints. The hat shelf near the front door swept us back to childhood. Stacey and I became little girls, trying on different hats until we found the perfect one for our dress-up tea party. We would then choose a lovely table and order our tea. That was a precious time, filled with laughter between scones  and sharing our lives between tiny cucumber sandwiches.\nSpringtime descended upon Denver, and the sun lightened my heart. But I still fought loneliness almost every day. I decided to explore the Denver area. While my husband went to the office, I took time to see what our new area had to offer.\nOne day, I was walking along the street when suddenly the words \"Tea Leaves\" caught my eye. A tea room? Here, in the land of loneliness and pain?\nI walked through the doors, and tears came to my eyes. It was a beautiful room, not Victorian, but simple and lovely.\nI sat down and ordered a pot of tea, a cucumber sandwich, and some scones.It felt silly and wonderful --- and it felt like home. For the first time since moving, I felt as if this new city and state could be, would eventually be, my home. I would come back here and bring new friends. When Stacey visited, we would come here.\nI lifted my cup and made a silent toast. I toasted Stacey, whom I missed  ly, and I toasted the sweet little tearoom that lessened my pain.", "id": "high2812.txt"}
