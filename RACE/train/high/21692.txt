She worked at several lower-paid jobs, relocated to a new city and even declared bankruptcy. Then in December, she finally moved back into her parents' home at age 52. \"I'm back living in the bedroom that I grew up in,\" she said. \n  Taking shelter with parents isn't uncommon for young people, especially when the job market is poor. But now the declining economy is forcing some children to do so later in life---even at middle age. \n  Financial planners report receiving many calls from parents seeking advice about taking in their grown children after divorces and lay-offs.

But a large number of  well-meaning parents must delay retirement or scale back their dreams because they have to help their children, Erickson said. And the sliding economy might threaten their jobs. \n  \"I almost have to act like a financial therapist,\" she said to Shirley. \"Here is the line I'm drawing for you. That's fine.
