Our parents have jobs that keep them busy almost all day long. They only have a free day in a week. This doesn't allow them to keep an eye on their children.\nOn the other hand, the modern society gives more freedom to the children than they could \"handle\". As a child, you don't know how to grow up by yourself until you reach a certain age. That is why you need school and parents to be by your side all the time. If you don't have either of them you may make a lot of mistakes. The social system of the modern society is very _ especially with the children.\nMost of the children today are rebels  . They are rude. They are given too much freedom by their families. This is their parent's mistake. They ought to know that the freedom they give to their children is misunderstood.\nFor example it is a bad thing for a 17 - year - old child to go out in the evening on weekends. Parents are also guilty of the way their children show up in the street or at school. The same guilt belongs to the teaching system as well. Pupils shouldn't be allowed to dress like they were on a fashion presentation at school.\nAnother important fact we can think of regarding the freedom of children is their free will of spending money. Parents shouldn't allow their children to spend money on whatever they want.\nI think children are given too much freedom not only by their parents, but also by the society. The latter is more to be blamed!", "id": "high2467.txt"}
