Remember the following to travel like a Londoner.\nKeep right on escalator \nLondon Underground asks that you stand on the right when using the escalators and leave the left free for others to walk down. If you are traveling in a big group, or with lots of shopping bags, stand and stay right and let others pass you---it will speed up the process and be a more pleasant journey for everyone!\nRemember the \"rush hour\"\nThe tube network is very busy during the rush hour. You can expect the trains and stations to be overcrowded between 7:30 and 9:30 in the morning and between 17:00 and 19:00 in the evening.\nMove down the platform to find more space\nAs you enter the station platform, you will often find more room if you walk down to the end of the platform. Here, the train carriages are usually the emptiest as well.\nCarry a bottle of water in warmer moths\nThe London Underground is over 150 years old and although the trains have been modernized, many still lack air conditioning and cooling units. Make sure you take a bottle of water with you, especially in the summer, as the long tube journeys can get very hot.\nKeep your personal belongings safe\nLike any large city be cautions of pickpockets operating in the busy stations and tubes. Carry a bag with zips and keep your personal belongings and valuable items in it to avoid becoming the victims of theft.\nPlan your journey on the London Underground in advance with a free tube map.
