One of the agents walked over to another agent and they started whispering to each other.Both gentlemen came back,and one of them then told us that it seemed that we were carrying a very dangerous object.\nMy sister and I just said,\"Huh?\"Of course,we were a little concerned,thinking that maybe someone put something dangerous in one of our bags when we weren't looking.\nOne of the agents then started to unpack our bags.I kept asking what he was 1ooking for and then the object in question finally appeared.It was our Cosima necklace.It's a piece of jewelry,with large,metal triangular spikes.\nMy sister and I 1ooked at each other and breathed a huge sigh of relief.We started laughing and explained to the two male agents that it was just a necklace from our collection.not a weapon of mass destruction.They thought we were lying,and one agent kept repeating that he believed it was a weapon.\nI tried to explain that we were jewelry designers going to a trade show,and this was simply a piece from our collection.But the agents didn't _ it.Then a few women guards came over to assist.One of the women guards was holding an earring up to her ear and another was trying on a ring.Apparently,they liked our stuff.\nIt was only at this point that the male guards gave up.And I think they also got tired of listening to a bunch of women talk about jewelry.They let us through.\nWe took the names of the women agents and sent them a piece of jewelry when we got back to say thanks.", "id": "high14913.txt"}
