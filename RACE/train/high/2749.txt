If metal is heated and then cooled very quickly , for example by dipping it in water , it will be very hard but also very brittle ---that is , It will break easily. Metal that has been annealed is soft but does not break as easily . It is possible to make metal as hard or as soft as is wished, by annealing it. The metal is heated, and allowed to cool slowly , for a certain length of time. The longer the heated metal takes to cool slowly , the softer it becomes . Annealing can also be used on other materials, such as glass.", "id": "high2749.txt"}
