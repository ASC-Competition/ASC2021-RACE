A device  called the Mosquitois being used in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New York to keep kids from gathering in big groups and causing trouble.\nThe Mosquitomakes a noise that only kids can hear. About 3000Mosquitounits have been fixed in the United Kingdom. In the United States, managers of an apartment building in New York City recently fixed one to keep noisy kids from taking over the building's entrance-hall.\nA children's rights agency in England wants the device forbidden. The agency says the device unfairly targets teens. Some also worry that the high sounds could hurt young ears. Fans of the Mosquito say it keeps kids out of trouble and off private property.\n\"Mosquito devices violate   the human rights of kids. The use of the devices is targeted at kids because it considers all kids as troublemakers. The devices are also harmful because the noise could hurt kids' hearing. Besides violating our rights, the Mosquitois dangerous. It could hurt the ears and the hearing of teens, babies and animals because they are more sensitive,\" says California eighth grader Kelly Straky. \"It is not right to place the device in a public place. Teenagers have as much right to public places as adults. I listened to theMosquitosound, and it was extremely loud. It hurts not only your ears but also your whole head. It isn't just annoying; it's painful. It should not be allowed.\"\nFans of the Mosquitobelieve that property owners have a right to decide who can be on their property and who cannot.Mosquitodevices are a method of protecting private property and keeping the peace. Property laws are put into place to protect the public.\n\"Yes, I do believe that the rights of teens should be valued, but we must always put ourselves in other people's shoes and see the other side. In this case, doing so allows people to understand the negative effects, such as crime, that loitering   can have on an area or a community,\" said Kayla Hill from New York.", "id": "high20256.txt"}
