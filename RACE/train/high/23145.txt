The fear that he saw in the eyes of that first dog-eventually replaced by gratitude and love-moved Grim so deeply that even at that young age he knew he had found his life's work. In 1998, Grim formed a nonprofit group called Stray Rescue. The group's goal: to save as many of St. Louis's stray dogs as possible.\nToday, Grim heads up an organization with a $3 million annual budget, a staff of more than 50 paid workers, thousands of volunteers, and a well-equipped shelter that houses as many as 200 dogs. The money that supports Stray Rescue has been raised through donations and through the force of Grim's outspoken advocacy . A man who sees himself as shy is anything but that when it comes to speaking out for dogs.\nThe impact has been significant. While there are no good estimates as to the number of stray dogs on the streets of St. Louis, today 40% more dogs are being picked up off the streets than just two years ago, about 98% are now adopted into homes.\nStray Rescue also funds a massive education campaign. The group's bill-boards advocating adoption and neutering of dogs are everywhere, as are brochures informing the public of free medical care for dogs and volunteer opportunities at Stray Rescue.\n\"The whole landscape has changed,\"says Pam Walker, St. Louis city health director. Since Grim's involvement, she says, St. Louis has become a model for good practices in the area.\nOfficials elsewhere sometimes ask how St. Louis deals with its dog problems. Walker says,\"My answer is:We have Randy Grim.\"\nGrim says he is delighted at the way the city has responded. Many St. Louis citizens\"were already there,\"he says, in terms of concern for dogs. \"I'm really proud of my city.\"", "id": "high23145.txt"}
