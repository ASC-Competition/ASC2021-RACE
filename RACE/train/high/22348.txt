It has been announced that a comet   is heading towards the Earth. Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth. \nOn 17 July, a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion.  About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the sea bed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards from the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. \nBefore the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina.  Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long.  Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. \nCould it really happen? Will we meet the same end?", "id": "high22348.txt"}
