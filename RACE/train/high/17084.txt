Their work was a fresh and original way of painting. It seems that the artists painted a scene after just a quick look at it.\n   Often painting outside, rather than in a studio, the artists observed nature more directly and tried to capture individual moments in time especially the changing light of the sun. They avoided black and earth color1s and as a result their work is often very bright and can also look like that it is shining.\n   When they first appeared, the artists were criticized for not finishing their paintings and for being lazy. Critics said the Impressionists were satisfied with just a few inexact brushstrokes instead of completing a real painting. It was an art critic who first used the term \"Impressionist\" in a review of Monet's work \"Impression, Sunrise\"(1873) to satirize  his loose, inexact manner of painting.\n   \"Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love,\" said Monet.\n   Monet is the leading figure in the creation of Impressionism. He painted sunlit rivers and gardens with forceful brushstrokes and bright color1s, in which objects lose their shape in the light. Monet's painting reached its height in his later life with his paintings of water lilies.", "id": "high17084.txt"}
