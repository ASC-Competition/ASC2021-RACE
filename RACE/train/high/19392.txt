Lombard Street owns the record as the street with the most switchbacks in a single block. With eight steep and sharp turns, Lombard Street looks like a giant dizzy snake lying on the road. This famous street in San Francisco is known as the most-challenging street of all.\nParliament Street (Exeter, England)\nThis street in England is over a hundred years old today, but what makes it as an urban wonder is not its age but its unbelievable narrow size. Usually, a street is where a vehicle can conveniently pass, but that will never happen in the Parliament Street, as the street measures just 25 inches wide which is just enough for a  ly medium-built person to pass.\nKing Fahd's Fountain (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia)\nThe fountain was donated to the city by King Fahd. Being the world's tallest fountain, it deserves to be an urban wonder. It was constructed between 1980 and 1983. This fountain shoots water in an incredible 1023-foot (312m) height which is greater than the height of the Eifel Tower. Because of its seemingly unreachable height, the waters of the King Fahd's Fountain can be sighted even if the visitors are miles apart.\nDamanhur Temple (Northern Alps of Italy)\nThe underground of the modest homes of Italy's northern Alps is where a massive, richly -decorated temple is found. The Damanhur Temple was secretly constructed in the 1970s. Decorated with impressive murals   and vividly-color1ed stain glass, the temple was once seized by the Italian government due to illegalities. After some time, it was returned to Oberto Airaudi, the builder and founder of Damanhur.", "id": "high19392.txt"}
