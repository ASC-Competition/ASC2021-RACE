Thompson,one professor from Ohio State University, said measurements using modern navigation satellites show that the oldest ice layers on the famous mountain were deposited during an extremely wet period starting about 11,700 years ago.The mountain appears in literature, most notably Ernest Hemingway's \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\" and some ancient beliefs in Africa hold the mountain to be a sacred place.\nBut a temperature rise in recent years is destroying the 150-foot-high blocks of ice that gave Kilimanjaro its unique white cap.\"The ice will be gone by about 2030,\" said Thompson. The disappearing ice already has reduced the amount of water in some Tanzanian rivers and the government fears that when Kilimanjaro is bald of snow the tourists will stop coming.\n\"Kilimanjaro is the number one foreign currency earner for the government of Tanzania,\" said Thompson. \"It has its own international airport and some 20,000 tourists every year. The question is how many will come if there are no ice fields on the mountain.\"\nAfrica was not alone in the global drought. Thompson said other records show that civilizations during this period collapsed in India, the Middle East and South America.\nResearchers put markers on the ice field blocks in 1962 and Thompson said measurements using satellites show the summit of the ice has been lowered by about 56 feet in 40 years. The _ of the ice also has moved back more than six feet in the past two years, much smaller than before.\n\"That's more than two meter's worth of ice lost from a wall 164 feet (50 meters) high,\" said Thompson. \"That's an enormous amount of ice.\"", "id": "high9241.txt"}
