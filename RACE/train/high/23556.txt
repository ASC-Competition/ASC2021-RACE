Well, I'm going to call the police.' And that's when he hit me with the chain,\" said Jamie.\nHe got hit in the legs and then the man and the dog ran off.\nTwenty minutes later, the man came back and attacked Jamie with a slingshot   before throwing a rock at him, hitting him in the back.\nJamie now has to use the wall to steady himself and his hands won't stop shaking, but he expects to be OK.\nDespite his injuries, he has no regrets. Jamie says he'd do it all again.\n\"He was hurting the dog. I have had a dog for 13 years that looked just like Tomba. The dog was crying for help. I just wanted him to let the dog go. I didn't think he'd beat me,\" said Jamie.\nThe police arrested the man, who would face at least one charge of assault  .\nTomba obviously was not seriously injured.\n\"That's all that's important.
