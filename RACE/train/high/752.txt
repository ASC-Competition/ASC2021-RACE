One day your luck will change.\"\nI didn't pay attention to her words. After finishing my college education, I decided to look for a job in a radio station. I wanted to host a sports programme. I went to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station. ButI got turned down every time.\nIn one station, a kind lady said to me that I hadn't got enough experience. \"Get to a small station and work for some time,\" she said.\nWhen I went back home, my dad told me that a businessman had opened a store and needed someone to help him. But again, I didn't get the job.\nI felt really down. \"Your luck will change,\" Mum said to me. Later, I tried another radio station in Iowa. But the owner, a nice man, told me he had already had someone to work for him. As I left his office, I asked, \"How can someone be a sportsannouncer  if he can't get a job in a radio station?\"\nI was waiting for the lift when I heard the man call, \"What did you mean? Do you know anything about football?\" He let me sit in front of a microphone and asked me to try to imagine that I was giving my opinion on a football game, and finally I succeeded.\nOn my way home, Mum's words came back to me, \"One day your luck will change, Son.\"", "id": "high752.txt"}
