There they will team up with members of the CyArk Foundation, a non-profit organization that has identified several \"at risk\" World heritage Sites. Mount Rushmore is on their list because of concerns over deterioration of the faces of four former presidents on the sculpture.\n   Laser scanning itself is not new but applying the technology to historic sites or buildings is a new approach. \"At first, these laser scanners were produced for things like refineries where there are lots of pipes and things or atmosphere that are different for humans to actually tolerate,\" Chris McGregor of Historic Scotland told Reuters Television. \"They hadn't really thought about the built heritage as being a market for such a machine but its use and the work that we are doing with it is really innovative and really exciting.\n   CyArk's goal is to create a huge database of detailed surveys of sites so that they can be maintained or even rebuilt if they should be damaged by a natural disaster, climate change or even war. They cited as an example the Buddhas or Bamiyan in Afghanistan, two monumental statues of standing Buddhas carved into the side of a cliffduring the sixth century that were destroyed by the Taliban in 2001. Despite offers from the governments of Japan and Switzerland, among others, to help rebuild the Buddhas, the team believe an accurate laser survey would have made the task more achievable.\n   Doug Pritchard from the Glasgow School of Art's Digital Design Studio said, \"We are discovering new things about the buildings which are hundreds, thousands of years old,\" he said.\n   CyaArk said the loss of architectural and archaeological cultural heritage is becoming a crisis of global proportions with an urgent need for reliable documentation as a key step to help preserve heritage sites. The development of laser scanning technology has given a greater accuracy to surveys and thrown new light on ancient monuments.", "id": "high18600.txt"}
