With the car full of flowers we were going home. On our way back my wife noticed a cupboard   outside a furniture shop. It was tall and narrow. \"Buy it,\" my wife said at once. \"We'll carry it home on the roof rack  . I've always wanted one like that.\"\nWhat could I do? Ten minutes later I was PS20 poorer; and the cupboard was tied on the roof rack. It was six feet long and eighteen inches square, quite heavy too.\nIn the gathering darkness I drove slowly. Other drivers seemed unusually polite that evening. The police even stopped traffic to let us through. Carrying furniture was a good idea.\nAfter a time my wife said, \"There's a long line of cars behind. Why don't they overtake, I wonder?\" In fact a police car did overtake. The two officers inside looked at us seriously as they passed. But then, with great kindness, they led us through the rush-hour traffic. The police car stopped at our village church. One of the officers came to me.\n\"Right, sir,\" he said.\"Do you need any more help?\"\nI was a bit puzzled. \"Thanks, officer,\" I said. \"You have been very kind. I live just on the road.\"\nHe was staring at our car, first at the flowers, then at the cupboard. \"Well, well,\" he said, laughing. \"It's a cupboard you've got there! We thought it was something else.\"\nMy wife began to laugh. The truth hit me like a stone between the eyes. I smiled at the officer. \" Yes, it's a cupboard, but thanks again.\"I drove home as fast as I could.", "id": "high3921.txt"}
