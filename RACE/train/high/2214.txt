She says you must study for the examinations for Queen's College in two years' time. Then if you do well, you can study at Queen's in Charlottetown for a year, and after that you'll be a teacher!\"\n\"That doesn't matter, Anne. When Matthew and I adopted you three years ago, we decided to look after you as well as we could. Of course we'll pay for you to study.\"So in the afternoons Anne and some of her friends stayed late at school, and Miss Stacy helped them with the special examination work. Diana didn't want to go to Queen's, so she went home early, but Gilbert stayed. He and Anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies, because they both wanted to be first in the examination. Secretly, Anne was sorry that she and Gilbert weren't friends, but it was too late now.\nFor two years, Anne studied hard at school. She enjoyed learning, and Miss Stacy was pleased with her. But she didn't study all the time. In the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends, or walked through the fields with Diana, or sat talking to Matthew.\n\"Your Anne is a big girl now. She's taller than you,\" Rachel Lynde told Marilla one day.\n\"You're right, Rachel!\" said Marilla in surprise.\n\"And she's a very good girl now, isn't she? She doesn't get into trouble these days. I'm sure she helps you a lot with the housework, Marilla.\"\n\"Yes, I don't know what I'd do without her,\" said Marilla, smiling.\n\"And look at her! Those beautiful grey eyes, and that red-brown hair! You know, Marilla, I thought you and Matthew made a mistake when you adopted her. But now I see I was wrong. You've looked after her very well.\"\n\"Well, thank you, Rachel,\" replied Marilla, pleased.\nThat evening, when Matthew came into the kitchen, he saw that his sister was crying.\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked, surprised. \"You haven't cried since... well, I can't remember when.\"\n\"It's just... well, I was thinking about Anne,\" said Marilla. \"I'll...I'll miss her when she goes away.\"\n\"When she goes to Queen's, you mean? Yes, but she can come home at weekends, on the train.\"\n\"I'll still miss her,\" said Marilla sadly.\"\nIn June the Avonlea boys and girls had to go to Charlottetown to take their examinations.\n\"Oh, I do hope that I've done well,\" Anne told Diana when she arrived back at Green Gables. \"The examinations were very difficult. And I've got to wait for three weeks before I know! Three weeks! I'll die!\"\nAnne wanted to do better than Gilbert. But she also wanted to do well for Matthew and Marilla. That was very important to her.\nDiana was the first to hear the news, she ran into the kitchen at Green Gables and shouted, \"Look, Anne! It's in Father's newspaper! You're first... with Gilbert... out of all the students on the island! Oh, how wonderful!\" Anne took the paper with shaking hands, and saw her name, at the top of the list of two hundred. She could not speak.\n\"Well, now, I knew it,\" said Matthew with a warm smile.\n\"You've done well, I must say, Anne,\" said Marilla, who was secretly very pleased.\nFor the next three weeks Anne and Marilla were very busy. Anne needs new dresses to take to Charlottetown.", "id": "high2214.txt"}
