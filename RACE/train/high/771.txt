It can be used for patching up differences, apologizing, saying \"no,\" criticizing, getting the other fellow to do what you want without his losing face.

Moving only her head the hostess smiled at her son,\" No harm, Daniel,\" she said. \"Just pick him up and take him back to the kitchen\"... she enunciated clearly so he would think about what she was saying... \"and bring in the other one.\"\nA wink and a one-liner instantly changed the dinner from a red-faced embarrassment to a conspiracy of fun.", "id": "high771.txt"}
