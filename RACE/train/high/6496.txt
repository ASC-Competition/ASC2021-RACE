Then her husband lost his job, and the plan fell apart.\n\"I have two kids in college, and I want to say 'come home', but at the same time I want to provide them with a good education.\" says Jacobs.\nThe Jacobs family did work out a solution. They asked and received more aid from the schools, and each son increased his borrowing to the maximum amount through the federal loan   program. They will each graduate with $20,000 of debt, but at least they will be able to finish school.\nWith unemployment rising, financial aid administrators expect to hear more families like the Jacobs. More students are applying for aid, and more families expect to need student loans. College administrators are concerned that they will not have enough aid money to go around.\nAt the same time, tuition continues to rise. A report from the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education found that college tuition and fees increased 439% from 1982 to 2007, while average family income rose just 147%. Student borrowing has more than doubled in the last decade.\n\"If we go on this way for another 25 years, we won't have an affordable system of higher education,\" says Patrick M. Callan, president of the center. \"The middle class families have been financing it through debt. They will send kids to college whatever it takes, even if that means a huge amount of debt.\"\nFinancial aid administrators have been having a hard time as many companies decide that student loans are not profitable enough and have stopped making them. The good news, however, is that federal loans account for about three quarters of student borrowing, and the government says that money will flow uninterrupted.", "id": "high6496.txt"}
