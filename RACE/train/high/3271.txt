I had never heard of culture shock. All I knew was that I was unhappy and wanted to go home.\nThat was twenty years ago, and since then culture shock has become a real field of study. It is now understood that any normal person, finding him or herself for an extended time in a new culture, is in for trouble.\nThe process of \"culture shock\" is now recognized as so predictable that its four stages have been noticeable. The first is the honeymoon stage, familiar to those of us who love to travel, but never stay in one place long enough to find out what follows. In this stage, the new country and its people seem delightful. Everything is better than home. Everything is so different and charming.\n _ Now the people start to look shallow, selfish and stupid. The different ways of doing things don't seem interesting any more. You start to feel tired all the time. Culture shock has set in. You feel at sea.\nThe emotional response to culture shock in stage two can be extreme. Confusion, depression and anxiety, and resentment can all enter to varying degrees. You may become physically ill. Little things seem terribly annoying.\nThe happier resolution is to move on to stage three. Adjusting. Rather than itemizing  what's \"wrong\" with Americans, you remind yourself that \"right\" and \"wrong\" are not meaningful terms in cultural matters.\nInstead, you try to understand what motivates Americans, perhaps realizing that many of the things you don't like are related to the things you do like.\nAs time goes on, you should be moving into stage four. Acceptance. At this point, you simply don't think any more about the specialties of Americans. You accept them as individuals. You have started to feel at home; you know how to do things. You have not rejected your old culture; but the American ways have settled upon you. You feel optimistic about your future here. You have truly arrived.", "id": "high3271.txt"}
