It\nis a legal requirement that all kids be educated, though. When parents believe they can give their kids a better education--- or have other reasons for not wanting to send their kids to a local school --- they may choose home schooling.\nHowever, if a kid hates school, home schooling is probably not the escape he is looking for. Home schooled students can learn just as much as they would in regular school if they and their parents work hard to cover all the subjects and experiences necessary. Parents who home school usually have higher levels of education than parents who do not. They already have the skills to educate themselves about teaching their kids.\nParents who home school have to be able to put the time and skill into not just teaching, but also researching lesson plans and resources . So they have to know how to find the information necessary to teach their kids. State schools often provide home-schooling parents with a curriculum , books and materials and places to meet. Some state schools will point parents to other resources for _ forgotten subjects. Or parents may receive continuing education at local colleges or universities.", "id": "high7004.txt"}
