Would you perhaps be willing to sleep in my room? It's not a suite, but it will be good enough to make you comfortable for the night.\" The couple agreed.\nAs the elderly man paid the bill the next morning, he told the clerk, \"You are the kind of person who should be the boss of the best hotel in the United States. Maybe someday I'll build one for you.\" The clerk looked at them and smiled. The three of them had a good laugh.\nTwo years passed. The clerk had almost forgotten the incident when he received a letter from the elderly man, asking the clerk to pay him a visit. The elderly man met him in New York, and led him to the corner of the Fifth Avenue and 34thStreet. He then pointed to a great new building there, a reddish stone one with watchtowers thrusting   up to the sky, and told the clerk that it was the hotel he had just built for him to manage.\nThat wonderful building was the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. And this young clerk whose name was George C. Boldt never foresaw the return of events that would lead him into the manager of one of the world's most attractive hotels.", "id": "high9394.txt"}
