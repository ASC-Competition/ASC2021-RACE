Your free club magazine arrives once a month, to keep you up-to-date with the latest bestsellers. This means that every year we offer over 1,000 books to choose from. On the Internet, you can find all our titles for the year on our exclusive members' website.\nBeing a member:\nAll we are asking you to do while you are a member is to choose four books during your first year. After that, you can decide on the number of books you wish to take.\nIn each of our monthly club magazines, our experienced staff choose a Club Choice book -- a work of fiction or a reference title which they feel is particularly worth buying, and which is offered at an extra-special price. However, if you do not want this book, just say so in the space provided on the form. We will always send the book if we do not receive this.\nSo, return your application form today, but hurry -- it's not every day we can make you an offer like this. To apply to become a member, all you need to do is simply fill in the enclosed form and return it in the envelope supplied.\nBefore you know it, your books will be with you. Please don't send any money now, as we will send you your bill with the books. And remember, you have up to a fortnight to decide if you wish to keep the books you have ordered. You should then either return the books or send your payment.", "id": "high8969.txt"}
