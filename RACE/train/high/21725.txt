Fashionable clothes for the children, expensive birthday parties and lots of toys are also on the list of luxuries families don't have to have. Instead, recession -hit parents are thinking of the future, and the things they want for their children centre around learning to behave properly, good education and good health. \n    Their picture of what a family ought to have includes a space to eat together away from the television, plenty of fruit and vegetables, and bicycles so children can get exercise. \n    The breakdown of necessities and luxuries was prepared by researchers from the Department for Work and Pensions(DWP) who were trying to establish an up-to-date picture of what parents say they really need. \n    Their findings show how families have scaled down their expectations in the face of economic difficulties -- how parents are now concentrating their attention and money firmly on the long-term interests of their children. Many believe that while it is vital for a family to do things together, day trips or weekend breaks are enough. \nSpending on furniture or decorating the house was also considered luxurious, unless the state of the home was so bad it became difficult to invite visitors in.\n   Instead, researchers said: A family home should have an area where the family can eat together, not on their laps in front of a television. Families should be able to go on outings, overnight trips and possibly short holiday: the fact of being able to share these experiences is more important than the precise activity and its cost.", "id": "high21725.txt"}
