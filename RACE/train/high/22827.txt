The \"haters\" will always find a reason to speak ill of you and even condemn you.\nThey're spiteful   people who envy you the pride you have in yourself and the recognition you're receiving from others. They can't stand it that you're happy, fulfilled and achieving your goals.\nThese hateful individuals are unwilling to do the work that you've done. They hate your success but are too lazy to invest real time or energy in achieving their own goals.\nThe thing you need to know about these haters is that the only reason they behave this way is that you have something they want, but they aren't willing to work for it.\nThe haters are convinced that you've been lucky or that you've had some unfair advantage, but the truth is that your success is born of your untiring efforts, and it's these efforts that have brought about your \"luck.\"\nThe best way to deal with haters is what I call the \"one-two punch.\" First, don't let them hurt you. Be happy about your success and proud of your accomplishments. Company with those who approve you, recognize you and support you, and never doubt that you deserve all the success. The haters are angry, jealous people. What they think or say is meaningless.\nNext, the more the haters annoy you, the more you should be motivated to succeed. They want to ruin you, but your response should be to work that much harder in order to increase your level of success.\nWhen your reaction to their bad behavior has inspired you to achieve further success, you've transformed the haters' negativity   into fuel for your creative fires. Not only can they not hurt you but they've inspired you onto even greater heights by chance.", "id": "high22827.txt"}
