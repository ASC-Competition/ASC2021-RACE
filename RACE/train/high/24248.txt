He said his team was \"trying to modify pigs so their organs might save the lives of humans.\" \nThe scientists are introducing human genes into the animals to reduce the chances of the organs being rejected by patients, as has been common in previous attempts to use animal tissues, said Winston, who heads the Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology at London's Hammersmith Hospital. \nWorking with Dr. Carol Redhead of the California Institute of Technology, Winston's team has injected human genes directly into male piglets , adding them to the animal's sperm . \nHe said that pigs involved in experiments had successfully produced transgenic sperm, but acknowledged that British and European laws had prevented the team from using the pigs to mate. \nThe Sunday Times newspaper reported that the experiments would be moved to the United States following difficulties with funding and regulations in Britain. It said the pigs would be bred in Missouri. \n\"Our U.S. friends will benefit from our technology and the income we might have produced for Britain will be lost,\" Winston wrote. \nSome scientists have previously blamed the idea of using animal organs for human transplant, saying the technique risks spreading animal viruses to humans. Winston said his research project is attempting to breed virus-free pigs.", "id": "high24248.txt"}
