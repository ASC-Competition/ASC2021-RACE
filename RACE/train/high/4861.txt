The stream then thought, \"I've been through countless obstacles. I should have no problem crossing this desert!\" But when she decided to start her journey, she found herself gradually disappearing into the mud and sand. After numerous tries, she found it was all in vain and was very upset. \"Maybe it's my destiny  ! I'm not destined to reach the vast ocean in the legend, \" she murmured sadly to herself.\nAt this time, a deep voice came, saying, \"If a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river.\"\nIt was the voice of the desert. Unconvinced, the little stream replied, \"That's because a breeze can fly, but I can't.\"\n\"That's because you stick to what you are. If you're willing to give it up, and let yourself evaporate   into the breeze, it can take you across, and you can reach your destination,\" said the desert in its deep voice.\nThe little stream had never heard of such a thing. \"Give up what I am now and disappear into the breeze? No! No!\" She could not accept this idea. After all, she had never experienced anything like it before. Wouldn't it be self-destruction to give up what she was now?\n\"How do I know if this is true?\" asked the little stream.\n\"The breeze can carry the vapor across the desert and release it as rain at an appropriate site. The rain will form a river again to continue its course,\" answered the desert very patiently.\n\"Will I still be what I am now?\" asked the little stream.\n\"Yes, and no. Whether you're a river or invisible vapor, your inner nature never changes. You stick to the fact that you're a river because you don't know your inner nature,\" answered the desert.\nDeep down, the stream vaguely remembered that before she became a river, it was perhaps also the breeze that carried her halfway up a high mountain, where she turned into rain and fell onto the ground and became what she was now. Finally the little stream gathered her courage and rushed into the open arms of the breeze, which carried her to the next stage of her life.\nPerhaps you can try asking yourself these questions: What is my inner nature? What is it that I cling   to? And what is it that I really want?", "id": "high4861.txt"}
