Thus,marriage remains by far the preferred way of life for the vast majority of people in our society.\nWhat has changed more than marriage is the nuclear family.Twenty five years ago,the typical American family was made up of a husband,a wife,and two or three children. Now there are many marriages in which couples have decided not to have any children.And there are many marriages where at least some of the children are from the wife's former marriage,or the husband's,or both.Sometimes these children spend all of their time with one parent from the former marriage;sometimes they are shared between the two former spouses .\nThus,one can find every type of family arrangement.There are marriages without children;Marriages with children from only the present marriage;Marriages with \"full time\" children from both the present and former marriages;Marriages with \"full time\" children from the present marriage and \"part time\",children from former marriages.There are stepfathers,stepmothers,half brothers, and half sisters.It is not all that unusual for a child to have four parents and eight grandparents! These are great changes from the traditional nuclear family.But even so,even in the midst of all this,there remains one constant:Most Americans spend most of their adult lives married.", "id": "high17034.txt"}
