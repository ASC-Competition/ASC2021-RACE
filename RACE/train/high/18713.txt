We moved here from New York City, so I am used to reading excellent newspapers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times. In fact, we still have the Times delivered on Sundays. All the members of my family enjoy reading the recipes in the magazine, as well as the Styles section. My children are crazy about their sports section. \nThe Times is great, but the Gazette is another story. I've never read an article that doesn't contain at least three or four spelling or grammatical errors. For example, in last week's issue, you misspelled the word \"secretary\", used a singular verb with a plural noun, and used \"it's\" as a possessive . And that was just in the lead story! In case you never went to elementary school, \"it's\" means \"it is\". It's not a possessive pronoun! In another case, the re-port you gave on an event was completely different from other newspapers. I didn't know what the reason was.\nIt's a pity that this city, Smithville, Wisconsin, has only one newspaper, because I'd like to have an alternative to the newspaper you publish. I find it hard to believe your news stories. If you can't spell correctly, how can you get your facts right? \nI've been meaning to get this off my chest for some time. Please cancel my subscription . And buy your-self a dictionary. \nSincerely, Jane Z. Jones", "id": "high18713.txt"}
