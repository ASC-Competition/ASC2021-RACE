However, have you heard about a frog that can kill a person?\nThese small brightly colored amphibians   live in the tropical  rain forests of Central and South America. They are best known for their ability to kill persons even though they are no more than 2 inches long. If we touch their poisonous skin without proper protection (such as gloves), we may die! For animals of this size that can be so deadly, they are certainly one of the world's most poisonous animals! Who are they? They are poison arrow frogs or, simply, poison frogs.\nPoison frogs acquired their name from the Indians. The Indians catch and kill many of these frogs before hanging them upside down over a campfire. As the frogs get hot, the poison drips out of their skin. The Indians collect the poisonous liquid in a bottle and dip  the tips of their arrows into the bottle. Once the tips are dried, they are ready to be used for their arrows for hunting.\nThere are about 170 different types of poison arrow frogs in the world. Though most species have bright markings, either in stripes or patches, on their black bodies, some just wear noticeable single-colored coats.

The sign simply says,\" Stay away or pay with your life!\" They certainly do not bluff.", "id": "high7173.txt"}
