He first met Xie Xingfang when he was 14-years-old. 16-year-old Xie was attending a national youth team badminton training camp in Jinjiang, Fujian and Lin was also there.\nTall and beautiful, Xie became the Snow White in the heart of Lin Dan, and he tried to please her and get chances to chat with her after the training sessions. He did not go beyond that.\nBefore the Spring Festival in 2004, Lin finally mustered(,) the courage and sent Xie Xingfang a text message - I LOVE YOU. In fact, Xie Xingfang had already realized Lin Dan was fond of her. And covertly  , she began to pay attention to Lin's movement and performance on the court. \"He is very interesting, got a lot of ideas, and is a lovely boy.\"\nTwo Kisses\nIn May 2004 at the Thomas Cup in Jakarta, their love relationship was first known to the public.

The teams had their rules - not going out of the training camp. Xie thought she would spend the Valentine's Day without flowers.\nBut Lin still managed to give her a surprise - giving her a Dior wallet as a Valentine's gift and nine roses. With the teams' rule in place, Lin asked his local friend to buy the roses and gave her a pleasant Valentines surprise.\nA 200-square-meter apartment\nLin Dan and Xie Xingfang's love has been through four years of tests, and Xie's father also said that they should consider marriage after the Olympics.\nIn fact, Lin Dan has already prepared for this. He has bought a 200-square-meter apartment in downtown Beijing, with 4 rooms and 2 living rooms. Paying about 20,000 yuan per square meter for the apartment, it is reported the apartment is now valued at 8 million yuan.\n\"After the Olympics, we really want to live our own lives, go on vacation, go to school, get married, I am really looking forward to it,\" Xie said happily.\nWith two kitchens, one Chinese and one Western style, Xie said she wanted to be the person preparing soup at home and enjoy family life.", "id": "high529.txt"}
