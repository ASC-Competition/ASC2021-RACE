He is unable to really talk about his time on the battlefield.\nBut as Swols sits in a clinic at Fort Bragg, his hand drops to the furry head beside him. His mood brightens. Sitting at his feet, Lexy , a 5-year-old German shepherd, gives Swols a few moments of distraction  . It's her job. And, according to Swols, she is good at it.\n\"I have a hard time talking to people about my battlefield experiences and everything,\" says Swols, who took part in several wars. Now he's been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .\n\"I just pet Lexy. Or I'm sitting here and we won't talk about military things. We'll just talk about the dog. My day is better every time I come in.\"\nFor Doctor Christine Rumayor, Lexy is a partner and a living, breathing medical tool. The dog can calm a patient and make a therapy   appointment a little more enjoyable.\nAnimal therapy is used in only a few other army medical centers. A small number of dogs like Lexy are being used almost as co-therapists.\nThe army is struggling to address stress disorders and mental health problems brought by more than ten years of war. One of the big difficulties is getting soldiers to seek treatment. Lexy, it turns out, is particularly good at that.\nRumayor , who uses Lexy in her practice, said there was a resistance   at first. \"You don't expect everyone to think they can just bring their dog to work,\" she said.\nWalking around the base, she uses Lexy to attract soldiers, and then draws them into conversation.\n\"There's nothing better than coming to an appointment where you get to have a warm furry thing that you get to pet all the time. People don't want to come in the door. When they see Lexy coming in, it makes them want to come in the door.\"", "id": "high18880.txt"}
