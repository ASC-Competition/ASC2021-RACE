Before heading to dinner in Jayanagar T Block, I was told by my wife that the rickshaw   fare would be 40 rupees. Anyhow I had 150 rupees in my pocket. My wife said that if the drivers of rickshaws see out-of-town travelers, they'll scam   them one way or another.\nAt a crowded stop, a young girl extended her hand through the iron bars on the side of our rickshaw to ask for some money. After we refused, or rickshaw driver started his remarks on giving.\n\"Giving is good. Every human should give. But we should know how to give.\" The rickshaw driver continued, \"Most of these kids are trained by some guy who keeps all the money. It's run like a business. All of us should give, but this is just not the right place to give.\"\nHe talked a bit more before we arrived. I asked about the fare. \"39 rupees,\" he said.\nNow, most people who get cheated end up saying, \"Well, you know, I don't mind paying extra if it is a good guy but I refuse to be cheated.\" I gave him 40 rupees, and he gave me a 1 rupee coin in return (Most folks would just round up). So I put the coin in my wallet, and took out a 100 rupee note.\n\"Can you do me a favor?\" \"Of course, sir,\" he replied politely. \"We were talking about art of giving. You seem to know how and where to give. Can you put the 100 rupees to good use somewhere?\"\n\"Give me your address and I'll make sure I get a receipt   of where I gave,\" He replied without hesitation. I didn't understand him at first. Then I smiled and told him, \"I trust you.\"\nSo on the way back, instead of taking a bus to my place, I walked for the whole distance since I didn't have enough money. It was almost 1 a.m and I had to wake up at 6 a.m the next day. But I still walked.", "id": "high20798.txt"}
