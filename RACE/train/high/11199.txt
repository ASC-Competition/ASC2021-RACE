The small wooden house where he lived as a boy still stands there. Next to the house is a wooden fence. It is the kind described in Twain's book, \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\" published in1876.\nIn that story, Tom has been told to paint the fence. He does not want to do it. But he acts as if the job is great fun. He tricks other boys into believing this. His trick is so successful that they agree to pay him money to let them finish his work. \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" is considered one of the best books about an American boy's life in THE the1800s.\nTom Sawyer's good friend is Huckleberry, or \"Huck,\" Finn. Mark Twain tells this boy's story in \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\" Huck is a poor child, without a mother or home. His father drinks too much alcohol and beats him.\nHuck's situation has freed him from the restrictions of society. He explores in the woods and goes fishing. He stays out all night and does not go to school. He smokes tobacco.\nHuck runs away from home. He meets Jim, a black man who has escaped from slavery. They travel together on a raft made of wood down the Mississippi River. Huck describes the trip:  \"It was lovely to live on the raft. Other places seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft... Sometimes we'd have that whole river to ourselves for the longest time... We had the sky up there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them---. \"", "id": "high11199.txt"}
