Parents shower their kids with affection ,but it is intermingled with the desire to help their children achieve success.Parents are happy when their child studies hard,practices hard,wins first place,gets into a famous college.\nThe wolf of conditional 1ove is hidden in these homes.The parents feel they love their children in all circumstances.But the children often think differently.They feel that childhood is a performance--on the athletic field,in school and beyond.The shadowy presence of conditional love produces a fear,the fear that there is no completely safe love.\nMeanwhile,children who are uncertain of their parents'love develop a great hunger for it.

It's meant to be an unconditional support -a gift that can not be bought and cannot be earned.", "id": "high19759.txt"}
