Top students in the ninth and tenth grades can attend single-sex classes for math,science,English and social studies.\nThe aim is to help teenagers keep their mind on their work by keeping males and females apart. Rebecca Brown chooses the students for what Boonsboro High School calls the Academy. \"What we really want to do is take that top group of kids and take them to the very highest level they can achieve here,so that they're prepared for college,\" she said. They need high marks and test scores and strong teacher recommendations. They also need to be involved in activities.\nMichael Bair has been at Boonsboro High School for twenty years and directs the Academy. His ninth-grade English class for boys centers on books that he believes boys find interesting. \"The novels they're reading now,are very manly novels. They're novels that deal with the arrogance of man and the pride of man.\" One of those books,for example,is \"The Call of the Wild\" by Jack London. This classic story tells of a dog stolen from his home and sold to work as a sled dog in Canada's Klondike Gold Rush.\nOn this day,the students are working in small groups. Vincent and Logan explain why they're drawing pictures that relate to the story. Vincent said,\"The main character,Buck,gets abducted , and they send him off to the Yukon in a train. So I'm drawing part of the story where he's in the train. It gets you to _ the setting of the story and gets you to think more about what's going on in the story,the important events of the story.\"\" Instead of just doing work sheets about it,this is a lot more fun,\" Logan added happily.\nMorgan Van Fleet likes being in the Academy. She says boys and girls act differently when they are together in a classroom. \"To me,it almost seems like it's hindering  your chances at developing yourself because you're more focused on 'Oh,I wish they'd shut up. Oh,what do they think of me?' instead of focusing on what's the homework or what's going on in this class,what's the lesson.\"", "id": "high4824.txt"}
