Instead, put on a pair of heavy gloves and gently move it into a box or bucket. Once contained, the bat can be removed outside.\n\"If it's a healthy bat, it'll fly away eventually,\" O'Keefe said. \"If it doesn't move or seem to be healthy, you can take it to the health department to be tested.\"\nThis is the time of year when bats move from their summer resting sites to their winter resting sites, O'Keefe said.\n\"We get calls every year during the first month of school year from people finding bats in the university's buildings,\" said O'Keefe.\nBats are a great help to people, as every night they can eat up to their entire body weight of insects. Bats, however, are facing great threats from epidemics , habitat destruction and other things.\n\"The best way the average person can help bats is by understanding them and by telling other people how awesome bats are and what bats do for us,\" O' Keefe said. \"Hopefully, _ will make people think that if there's a bat in their house, they should try to get it out but not kill it. That would be really positive for bats--to not have people be one of their major threats.\"", "id": "high14846.txt"}
