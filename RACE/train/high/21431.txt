I'm the ugliest plant in the desert.My spines   are thick and prickly  , my leaves are rubbery and tough, I can't offer shade or juicy fruit to any passing traveler.I don't see that I'm any use at all.\" All it did was stand in the sun day after day, growing taller and fatter.Its spines grew longer and its leaves tougher...It truly was strange-looking.\n\"I wish I could do something useful,\" it sighed.By day, hawks  circled high overhead.\"What can I do with my life?\" the cactus called.Whether they heard or not, the hawks sailed away.At night, the moon floated into the sky and cast its pale glow on the desert floor.\"What good can 1 do with my life?\" the cactus Called: The moon only stared coldly as it goes on its way.A lizard crawled by, leaving a little trail in the sand with its tail.\"What worthy thing can I do?\" the cactus called.\"You?\" the lizard laughed, pausing a moment.\"Worthy deed? Why, you can't do anything! The hawks circle ways overhead, tracing delicate patterns for us all to admire.The moon hangs high like a lantern at night, so we can see our way home.Even I, the lowly lizard can decorate the sands with these beautiful brush-drawings as I pull my tail\nalong.But you do nothing but get uglier every day.\"\nAnd so it went on year after year.At last the cactus grew old, and it knew its time was short.\"Oh, God\" it cried out, \"I've wondered so long, and I've tried so hard.Forgive me if I've failed to find something worthy to do.\" But just then the cactus felt a strange stirring and unfolding.At its very tip, like a sudden crown, a glorious flower suddenly opened in bloom.\nNever had the desert known such a blossom.Its fragrance perfumed the air far and wide and brought happiness to all passing by.\nThe butterflies paused to admire its beauty, and even the moon smiled when it rose to find such a treasure.The cactus heard a voice.\"You have waited long,\" the God said.\"the heart that seeks to do good reflects My glory, and will always bring something worthwhile to the world, something in which all can rejoice   --even if for only a moment.\"", "id": "high21431.txt"}
