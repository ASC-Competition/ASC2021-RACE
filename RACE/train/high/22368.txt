Her husband Richard had been in the newspaper office when the news of the railway accident was received, with Brent Mallard's name leading the list of \"killed\".\n    On hearing the news Louise cried at once in her sister's arms. When her tears ended she went to her room alone. She would have no one follow her. She sank into the comfortable armchair that faced the open window, as if she was pressed down by a sadness that seemed to reach into her soul.\nFrom the window she could see the tops of trees and new green spring life. The delicious smell of rain was in the air. Some blue sky could be seen through the clouds. She was young, with a fair, calm and intelligent face. But now there was an empty look in her eyes, as she dully stared out at the sky.\nFearing for her sister, Josephine came to the door and begged Louise to come out. Finally she opened the door. She held her sister's waist and together they came down the stairs. Richard stood waiting for them at the bottom.\nSuddenly there was the sound of someone opening the front door. Brent Mallard entered. He had been far from the accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood in shock as Louise let out a scream.\nWhen the doctor came, he said Louise Mallard had died of a heart attack.", "id": "high22368.txt"}
