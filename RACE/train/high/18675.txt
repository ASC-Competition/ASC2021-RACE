Besides the two enemies, Tony is also facing his own death. His man-made heart, which gives his Iron Man suit its power, is also harming his body.\nMy favourite part of the movie was when Iron Man uses his laser   against an army of Hammer's Iron Man robots. Everyone in the theater was cheering. My favourite special effects scene was the fight scene at a car race. Ivan tore Tony's car apart piece by piece.\nA funny part in the movie is when Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is inside a boxing ring   with Happy Hogan (played by director Jon Favreau). Happy Hogan tries to hit Natalie Rushman. However, he is the one who ends up on the floor.\nThe only problem I had with the movie was that I didn't understand why Ivan had so much hate toward Tony.\nI loved Iron Man 1 very much, and I expected Iron Man 2 to be much better. And after watching the movie, I'd like to say it is even better than I expected.", "id": "high18675.txt"}
