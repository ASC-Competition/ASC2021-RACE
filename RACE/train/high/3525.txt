They claim to be able to classify the nation's people by fridge contents.\nThey say those people can be separated into five categories:nutrition nerds (no social sense), food faddiest (whatever's in style), martyr mums, fast food fanatics and restaurant regulars.\nNutrition nerds care much about what they put into their bodies. Their fridges are stocked with fruit, vegetables and healthy meat.\nPeople in this category tend to be highly organized and usually work in law or accountancy. The vast majority is single, but if they have a partner, that person will be similar.\nA fridge full of vitamins -- enriched juices implies its owner works in media or fashion. They tend not to eat the foods they buy. Known as the food faddiest, they just want to be seen as purchasing the latest important things.\nA fridge filled with everything from steak to frozen fish suggests the martyr mum. Her fridge tends to be stocked with every kind of product, except what she herself would want. This fridge hints at difficulty balancing family and work life.\nFast food fanatics always buy mineral water or soda pop. The nearest they will get to fresh fruit is tomato sauce. Their fridges hint at someone who works hard and plays hard, also, someone who is not into long term planning.\nFinally, a fridge filled with nothing more than a bottle of white wine and some sparkling mineral water implies an owner who is single, lives in a big city and enjoys the finer things in life. The fridge is empty because this person regularly eats in restaurants.", "id": "high3525.txt"}
