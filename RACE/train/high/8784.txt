You can recover from this illness--I promise!Remember:If I recovered--you can too!\nI began throwing up when I was just a kid. Back then I didn't know why I did that. But now I can see that it was the result of my seeking so called fashionable diets.\nI was only 8 years old when my aunty phoned my mom saying that I'd thrown up my dinner.I told them it was just a party trick,and they ignored it. Their reaction made me realize that this \"trick\" of mine should be a secret. I would continue doing it,but would never let anyone know.\nAs I got older,this secret habit got more and more serious,and this carried on for years. During my first year of university,at the age of 20,I wasted over $20,000 on food from the school dining hall.\nFinally,after having had bulimia for nearly 12 years,I decided enough was enough. I was close to death--I could feel it in every part of my body. I needed help,and I made an appointment with a counselor of my university. One year later,I graduated from university. I was proud of myself for getting my degree. But there was a deeper pride and strength inside my mind. I had beaten bulimia. It had been a long and difficult road--but I'd done it.", "id": "high8784.txt"}
