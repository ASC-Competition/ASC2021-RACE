But he's also a lifelong farmer. He is familiar with the saying that each farmer can expect to have 40 opportunities to improve their harvest. And it's not just farmers who know there's a clock running on their efforts. \" We all need to recognize that we only have a fixed amount of time to affect change,\" said Howard G. Buffett(HGB)\n  HGB wants to invest more than $3 billion, in an effort to end global hunger and poverty for the world's nearly one billion poor people by 2045. He's decided to focus much of his effort on farming in the developing world. He believes that the best way to deal with poverty is to change the lives of farmers in the poorest nations on the planet. \"It's a pretty well proven fact that nothing works better at bringing people out of poverty than investment in rural areas,\" said HGB.\nHealthy soils are a most important part of productive farmers, but 1.5 billion people -- a fifth of the global population -- live on poor land. \"You have to fix the soil,\" he said. HGB also has the idea that farmers who own their own land will raise crops with an eye to the long-term health of the soil.\nHe would like to see that balanced with a foreign-aid plan. HGB notes that too often, experts want to make agriculture in developing nations look like farming in rich countries.\" It's not going to happen like that,\" said HGB. \"You need to consider local differences, local culture.\" Many more ideas of HGB can be found in his new book, Forty Chances: Finding Hope in a Hungry World.", "id": "high17652.txt"}
