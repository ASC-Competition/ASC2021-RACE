Aviad Sheinin,professor of Haifa University's Maritime Studies Department,said he didn't think the dolphins were harmed by the pollution,but he hoped that they would swim back to the sea soon. \"It seems that they are quite relaxed. They don't seem to be stressed,\" he said.\nHaifa Harbor is lined by chemical companies that have been pouring poisonous waste into the water for decades. While pollution levels have dropped in recent years,the water is still considered a health hazard.\n\"There are lots of fish in Haifa Harbor. Unfortunately we couldn't tell the dolphins that the fish are not healthy;and I don't know what the result will be,\" he told Israel Army Radio.Hundreds of Haifa residents gathered around Haifa Harbor to see the interesting sight,and researchers said this provided a rare chance to film and study the roughtoothed dolphins. In addition to the dozens of dolphins which swam into the port on Tuesday,a similar number stayed outside the breakwater .Later Tuesday the dolphins left the port but remained near the entrance and Israel's coast guard was patrolling  the area to try to make sure the dolphins didn't reenter the poisonous waters.\nRelatively little is known about roughtoothed dolphins,which are usually found in deep and warm tropical waters.", "id": "high18535.txt"}
