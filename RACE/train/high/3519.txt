They shared the food that had been prepared, while they talked a great deal about the farm.\nWhen the stranger left the following morning, he thanked the farmer and his wife and pulled a little bag of gold pieces out of his pocket. He said that maybe this would help them. He added that he'd come by next year with hopes of finding a revived farm.\nAfter this, the farmer and his wife often talked about whether they should buy a more promising cow.
