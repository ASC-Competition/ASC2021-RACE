By using a new technology, it speaks to you as you prepare a French dish. The kitchen breaks new ground by taking language learning out of the classroom and linking it with an enjoyable and rewarding real-life activity.\nThe new kitchen is designed to be used in schools, universities and even people's homes. It could also be an existing kitchen. The first version of the technology was tested in the kitchens of project partner Newcastle University. The kitchen could be available for schools and universities, and for the UK market by the June of 2014.\nThe Newcastle University team is now working on ways to put it on the market. And the European Union has given money to begin programs in six other languages, including English Italian and Spanish. Finally, versions could be developed for any language cuisine in the world.\nProfessor Paul says, \"By international standards, the UK students are now poor when it comes to learning languages--a problem that certainly has an economic influence. We believe that developing skills in a country's language and its cuisine will help change the trend.\" [( )] \nOn a computer fixed into the kitchen, the user first selects the French recipe they want to follow. Digital sensors built into dishes, containers and other equipment then communicate with the computer to make sure the right instructions are given at the right time, the user can ask the computer to repeat an instruction, or translate it into English, simply by pressing the touch screen. After cooking, the user can test what they have learned by carrying out a short test on the computer.\nAll grammar and vocabulary has been carefully selected to make sure that using the kitchen adds to basic proficiency in understanding French.\nNow three easy-carrying versions of the kitchen are being prepared. They're to be fixed in Newcastle University and at Institute Francais, a London-based charity devoted to teaching the French language. [( )]", "id": "high17291.txt"}
