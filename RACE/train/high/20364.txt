Her name was Safia. Her father and mother loved her very much, and would deny her nothing in the world.\n     One day, a magician came to the palace and asked for sanctuary  , saying that he was a professor who was being persecuted  by his enemies and had nowhere to write an important book. \"Good professor,\" said the king, \"you shall have a room and everything that you desire, on condition that you may finish your great work.\"\nSo the magician went on with his spells and magic formulas, pretending to be absorbed in scholarly matters. Every Friday, which was the day of rest in that far land, the magician paid his respects to the king and his court, but secretly he desired to take away the king's throne.\n      One day he disguised   himself as an old woman and walked under the trees in the palace gardens till he met Safia. \"Princess,\" he said, \"let me be your laundress, for I can wash linens and silks as finely as anyone in the world, and I would do it for almost nothing if I could serve Your Highness.\"  \"Good woman,\" said Princess Safia, \"I can see that you are a poor creature and grieve   for your condition. Come to my private quarters and I shall give you some of my linen to wash.\"\n     So the disguised magician followed the princess into the palace, and before the girl could see what was happening he bundled her into a laundry bag and ran away as fast as his legs would carry him. He took the princess into his private room. Muttering a magic spell, he made her as small as a doll, and put her in a cupboard.\nThe next Friday he went to the court as usual, and found the whole palace _ \"Princess Safia has vanished, and His Majesty is nearly out of his mind. All the soothsayers  have tried to find out through their magical powers where she can be, but none of them have managed it,\" said the Grand Vizier. The wicked magician smiled, for he knew that his spell was so strong that it would defy  all the soothsayers in the land until the day of his death.", "id": "high20364.txt"}
