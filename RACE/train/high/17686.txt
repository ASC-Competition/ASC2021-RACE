With a diameter of 1,200 km , it is half that of Pluto-unusually large for a moon in relation to its  _ .\nBut now , using images from the Hubble Space Telescope , scientists from Johns Hopkins University , Southwest Research Institute and the Massachusetts instituteofTechnologysay they have found two more tiny orbiting satellites , P1 and P2.\nBoth are traveling outside the orbit of Charon and are tiny by comparison , the scientists wrote in the journal Nature.\nP1, the more distant of the two from Pluto , has a diameter of between 60 and 165 km while P2 is 20 percent smaller .\n\"Although definitive orbits cannot be obtained , both new satellites appear to be moving in circular orbits in the same orbital plane as Charon with orbital periods of about 38 days for P1 and 25 days for P2,\" they wrote .\nThe discovery of the two new members of P1uto's family makes it the only object in the Kuiper belt--a vast region of rock and ice beyond Neptune which contains debris from the formation of the solar system--known to have multiple satellites , the scientists said .", "id": "high17686.txt"}
