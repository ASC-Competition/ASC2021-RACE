When she was young, she took lessons in music and drawing, and read great books. She also travelled a great deal with her mother and father. \nAs a child, she felt that visiting sick people was both a duty and a pleasure. She enjoyed helping them. \nAt last, her mind was made up. \"I'm going to be a nurse,\" she decided.\n\"Nursing isn't the right work for a lady,\" her father told her.\n\"Then I will make it so,\" she smiled. And she went to learn nursing in Germany and France. When she returned to England, Florence started a nursing home for women. \nDuring the Crimean War in 1854, she went with a group of thirty-eight nurses to the front hospital. What they saw there was terrible. Dirt and death were everywhere to be seen and smelled. The officer there did not want any woman to tell him how to run a hospital, either. But the brave nurses went to work.\nFlorence used her own money and some from friends to buy clothes, beds, medicines and food for the men. Her only pay was the smiles from the lips of dying soldiers. But they were more than enough for this kind woman.\nAfter war, she returned to England and was honoured for her service by Queen Victoria. But Florence said that her work had just begun. She raised money to build the Nightingale Home for Nurses in London. She also wrote a book on public health, which was printed in several countries. \nFlorence Nightingale died at the age of ninety, still trying to serve others through her work as a nurse. Indeed, it is because of her that we honour nurses today.", "id": "high19815.txt"}
