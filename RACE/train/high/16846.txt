We didn't go to Greece in 2000,but we planned on going again in 2001.We found out that Uncle Spyro was in the hospital shortly before we left for Greece.My mother,Alethea,and I wanted to see him.But we waited until the day after we arrived.Now,I wish that we had gone the first daywe had arrived and that we had seen him for the last time. But my uncle didn't wait for us to go.\n    We still Visit Aunt Aspa,and we still pick almonds and lemons.We still drink the fresh lemonade and eat the delicious almonds on the porch.But somehow the lemonade isn't  as fresh and the almonds aren't as delicious as before.\n    I thank God that I'm still here to comfort Aunt Aspa and that I'm still here to finish my life.I'm not afraid of death anymore like some people.And I know that when I do die,I'll just be going up to Uncle Spyro,and we'll eat almonds and drink lemonade,just like before.", "id": "high16846.txt"}
