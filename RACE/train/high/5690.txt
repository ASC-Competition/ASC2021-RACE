Even then you can never recover the real value you place on your possessions. But you can't insure against the upset and unhappiness that we all feel if our homes are torn apart by some stranger, our windows and doors broken, our precious possessions ruined.\n\"It won't happen to me\"\nWon't it? A home is broken into every minute or so of the day. The thefts of all kinds, including cars and property stolen from cars, happen twice as frequently.\n\"I've nothing worth stealing\"\nYou may think not. But in fact everyone has something worth a thief's attention. And we all have things of special value to us even if they're worth little or nothing in cash terms.\n\"I'm just a tenant   here\"\nThe thief doesn't care whether you're a tenant or an owner-occupier. You're just as likely to be robbed. Have a word with the owner of the house if you think extra locks and fastenings are necessary.\n\"They'll get in anyway\"\nMost thieves are on the lookout for easy jobs. They are soon discouraged by houses they can't get into in any quick and easy way. So it's worth taking care.\n\"This booklet will help you\"\nIt's based on the practical experience of police forces throughout the country. Most of the suggestions will cost you only a few minutes extra time and thought. A few may involve some expense, but this is small compared with the loss and unhappiness you might otherwise suffer.\nIf you are in doubt, ask for free advice from the Crillle Prevention Officer at your local police station.", "id": "high5690.txt"}
