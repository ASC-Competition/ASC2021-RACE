The Maryland teenager Jack Andraka is the youngest winner of the $75,000 prize. He was chosen from among l,500 students in 70 countries.\nJack invented a test for pancreatic cancer( ). He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. \"I went on the Internet and I found that 85 percent of all pancreatic  cancers are found late, when someone has less than a 2% chance of survival he says. \"and I was thinking, 'That's not right and we should be able to do something.\"' He found that early discovery is important to increase the chances of suryiving the disease. \nJack asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test. which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His  test has proven correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. \"It costs 3\nJack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra . a professor at Johns Hopkins, who was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to and who showed interest in his project \"I was very surprised that it was a 15-year-old  who was writing this. I wanted to meet  this clever young man and see what he wanted to talked about. so I called for him over for an interview,\" Maitra said.\nJack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory completing his project in 7 months. The government bas given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product .\nWhatever happens, the professor believes that Jack Andraka's name is one we will be hearing  again over the next 10 to 20 years.", "id": "high18407.txt"}
