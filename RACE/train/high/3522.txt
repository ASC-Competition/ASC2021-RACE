It has been on this site since 1872. It has undergone refurbishment   and reopened in 2006 and an elevator now makes all floors accessible.\nThis is not a quiet place and children are allowed to have fun here. Child safety is extremely important and a member of staff remains by the front door at all times. Also, note the \"Code of Behavior\" notices, which include: children under 12 must be supervised by an adult; no eating in the galleries, and no running.\nToy exhibits are in glass cases and there are plenty of low-level exhibits for younger children to see. The glass cases have lots of thought-inspiring questions on them to encourage discussion between adults and children. When you or the children need some quiet time, there are sofas at either end of the second floor with reading books available.\nPros: Many free activities for kids\nCons: Can be too warm inside\nVisit Duration: 1.5 hours\nOpening Hours: 10:00 a.m. - 5:45 p.m.\nLast admission is 5:30 p.m.\nThe Museum is closed on 25 and 26 December and 1 January every year.\nAdmission: Admission to the Museum is free.
