He patrolled   the spring every day, and swept away all the leaves and other things that would dirty the fresh flow of water. Soon, beautiful swans   came to the clear spring, and the village became a popular attraction for visitors.\nYears passed. One evening the town leaders held a meeting. As they looked at the salary list, one of them said, \"Why do we keep this old man on year after year? I don't think we need him or his work.\" Later, the old man was asked to leave.\nFor several weeks, nothing changed. By early autumn, the leaves began to fall off the trees, and the spring was covered with leaves. A few days later, the water was much darker. Only a few months after the old man left, all the swans left, as did the tourists. Disease reached deeply into the village.\nQuickly, the leaders held a special meeting. Realizing their mistake, they rehired the old man. Then within a few weeks, the spring began to clear up. Soon new life returned to the village.\nSo, my friends, do you see? No matter how small your work or your life seems to be, never _ it. Anything we can do will make a difference.", "id": "high2178.txt"}
