Bob had just drawn up a \"motherhood contract\" ----- a document   stating that for 70 days this summer he would take over the care and feeding of the couple's four children, plus all household chores  . Although he didn't even know how to make coffee when he signed, he was quite confident.(He thought the experience would make a nice book.) After 40 of the 70 days, he was ready to give up. \"I was beaten down, completely humbled, \" admits Peters. Three weeks later he spoke to the local press (also part of the bargain), stating, \"Not only is motherhood a difficult task, not only is it never-ending, it is an impossible job for any normal human being.\" Bob and Pat were high school sweethearts. After they were married in 1960, she worked as a secretary to help put him through university. Since then Bob has been the football and wrestling coach at Palo Alto's Cubberley High while Pat raised the kids. Then two years ago Pat went back to work as a secretary at Cubberley. \"I had been around children so much,\" she sighs  , \"I couldn't talk to a grown-up.\" She continued to run the household, however----- until Bob signed the contract, whereupon she decided to relax and enjoy it. Although Peters had consulted   with his school's home economics teachers and the head of the cafeteria  , his meals were sometimes a disaster.\n\"I tried to slip the butter I'd forgotten under the eggs after they were frying, \" he says. For the last three weeks, the family ate out a lot--sometimes having Macdonald's hamburgers for lunch and dinner. As for housekeeping, a home economics teacher had told Bob that a room always looks clean if the bed is made. \"I found an easier way-----I shut the doors, \" he says. Soon the kids were wearing the same clothes for a week. \"I made them wear their shirts inside out, and when we went to pick up Pat at work they turned them right side out so they would look clean.\"\nNow that Bob has publicly admitted he was wrong, he is routinely  sharing the child-raising and household tasks with Pat. The tentative   title of his book about the summer is taken from something he shouted at the kids one day.", "id": "high2310.txt"}
