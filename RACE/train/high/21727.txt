But   to what. I do know that sometimes time \"seems\" to be moving slower. Remember Christmas Eve when you were a child? It was the longest night of the year. It lasted forever! And now it seems like I just paid my bill yesterday... and it's due again!\nPeople tell me all too frequently... I need more time! Oh, really?... Mother Teresa, Michelangelo, and Helen Keller all had 24 hours a day. Look what they did with their time!\nIs it that we need to manage our time better... or our priorities ? You've heard the expression \"first things first\". The first step in understanding the power of time is to understand that it is limited. Why is it then that some people get a lot more done? We know the answer. They use their time smartly.\nOne day an expert on time management was speaking to a group of students and announced a quiz. He pulls out a wide-mouthed jar. Next,he places about a dozen fist-sized rocks, one at a time, into the jar, until no more will fit. \"Is it full?\" he asks. \"Yes,\" responds the class. \"Oh really?\" he asks. So he takes out a bucket of gravel , which he manages to work down into the spaces between the larger rocks. \"Is it full now?\" he asks.\nWising up, one answered, \"Probably not.\" Sure enough . He takes out a bucket of sand, which he pours into the empty spaces. \"Is it full now?\" he asks. \"No\" reply the students confidently. So he takes a glass of water and fills it in. Then he asks, \"What is my point?''\nOne said, \"No matter how full your schedule is, if you try really hard, you can always fit some more things into it!\"\n\"No,\" the speaker replied, \"It tells us if you don't put the big rocks in first, you'll never get  them in at all.\"\nWhat are the big rocks? The things you should put in to your jar first.\nThe rich don't get 25 hours and the poor don't get 23... we all get the same. Let's use them wisely! Invest your time wisely!", "id": "high21727.txt"}
