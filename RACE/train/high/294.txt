Along the way he had completely run out of money and was forced to spend the night in his car. This continued until one morning, after a week of sleeping in his car, he walked nervously into a restaurant and ordered a big breakfast.\nAfter eating his first good meal in weeks, he found himself lying to the waiter, telling him he had lost his wallet. The waiter, who was also the owner, walked behind the chair where the young man had been sitting. He bent down, and came up with a $20 bill that looked as if it had fallen on the floor and said, \"Son, you must have dropped _ ,\" the owner said. The young man couldn't believe his luck! He quickly paid for the breakfast, left a tip, bought gas with the change, and headed West.\nOn the way out of town, he began to understand what that fellow did. Maybe nobody dropped the money at all. \"Maybe that fellow just knew I was in trouble and he helped me in a way that didn't embarrass  me. So I just made a promise to help other people if I can.\"\nLater, he worked very hard and became a rich man. Now he lives near Kansas City. Each year he gives away thousands of dollars. He is known as the \"Secret Santa\" because at Christmas time each year, he personally hands money out to those on the street and at restaurants. Last year, he gave more than $50,000 away in Kansas City.", "id": "high294.txt"}
