Most of them feel unfairly represented by the media and their lives are negatively   influenced, says a recent survey.\nThe survey was carried out by the UK Demos, in which more than 1000 14-17-year-old teens from England and Northern Ireland took part.\nThe survey report shows that four-fifths of teens (81%) felt there was a false image of young people in the media and wider society. Most of them (85%) said that it is hurting both their self-esteem  and chance of getting a job.\nBy researching six UK newspapers over the past 10 years, Demos found that words most commonly connected with \"teenagers\" and \"young people\" were \"binge-drinking\", \"yobs\" and \"crime\".\n\"The young people out there are doing good things for the community, but there are always bad things on the news. But we're not all like that, it's only a few,\" said Becky Brunskill, 18, member of Youth Parliament for Liverpool.\nThe survey also found that 80% of UK teenagers believed they cared more about social issues than the older generation. This was a view shared by their teachers, 66% of whom agreed in a separate Demos survey of 500 teachers.\nThe UK youth are also eager to make a difference. But rather than traditional politics, 87% of the teens believed social media was a good way to change society.\nJonathan Birdwell, author of the Demos report, said \"They could be the most active citizens we have seen in a generation.\"", "id": "high19021.txt"}
