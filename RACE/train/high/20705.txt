Please write your name and telephone number on the front. If no one claims   the money, we will call you.\"\nThe lady explained, \"I have lost money before and it was never turned in. I remember how I felt. I don't want to make someone else feel that way.\" Then she left the post office. At almost the same time a very young man rushed in. He approached the postal clerk and asked, \"Has anyone turned in any money recently?\"\nHe told the clerk the amount, and the clerk laughed again. \"As a matter of fact, yes!\" she responded. \"It was turned in just a couple of minutes ago.\"\nThe look of relief   on the young man's face is a memory I will have for a long time. He said he thought the money was safe in his coat pocket when he walked in to check his mailbox. Only when he arrived home did he realize that it was no longer there.\nI finally finished preparing the package to be mailed, but I was the one who had a very special surprise in the post office.", "id": "high20705.txt"}
