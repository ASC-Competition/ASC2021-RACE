She never tried to speak. Many people passed, but never did one person stop.\nThe next day I decided to go back to the park, curious to see if the little girl would still be there. Right in the very spot as she was yesterday, she sat with the saddest look in her eyes.\nToday I was to make my own move and walk over to the little girl. As we all know, a park full of strange people is not a place for young children to play alone. \n    As I began walking towards her, I could see the back of the little girl's dress indicated a deformity . I smiled to let her know it was okay, I was there to help, to talk. I sat down beside her and opened with a simple \"Hello\". I smiled and she shyly smiled back. We talked until darkness fell and the park was completely empty. I asked the girl why she was so sad. The little girl looked at me and with a sad face said, \"Because I'm different.\" \n    I immediately said \"That you are!\" and smiled. The little girl acted even sadder. She said, \"I know.\" She looked at me and smiled. Slowly she stood to her feet, and said, \"Really?\"\n   \"Yes, dear, you're like a little guardian angel sent to watch over all those people walking by.\" She nodded her head \"yes\" and smiled, and with that she spread her wings and said with a twinkle in her eye, \"I am. I'm your guardian angel.\"\n   I was speechless, sure I was seeing things. She said, \"For once you thought of someone other than yourself, my job here is done.\" \n   Immediately I stood to my feet and said, \"Wait, so why did no one stop to help an angel!?\" She looked at me and smiled, \"You're the only one who could see me, and you believe it in your heart.\" ...and she was gone.\n   And with that my life changed dramatically. So, when you think you're all you have, remember, your angel is always watching over you. Mine is!", "id": "high17943.txt"}
