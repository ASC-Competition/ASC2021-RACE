We had to stop frequently because our little child needed to stretch from the car seat.\nOne of our stops, once we crossed the Oregon border, was at a Black Bear Diner. Walking towards the front door we noticed a gentleman standing at one side. He was clearly untidy, without shoes and wearing worn clothing. We passed right by him and opened the restaurant door. Then something told me to go back.\nHolding my daughter, I turned around and said to the gentleman, \"Sir. Are you hungry?\" He said, \"Yes.\" I then asked, \"May we buy you something to eat?\" He responded with, \"Sure, I can order something myself.\"\nMy husband opened the door and the gentleman went straight to the counter.
