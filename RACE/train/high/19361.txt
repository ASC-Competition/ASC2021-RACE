The art of the selfie is one that lots of people have practiced and perfected in recent years. A recent study shows 91 percent of teens have posted a photo of themselves online. Some celebrities   are regular selfie posters, too. It seems that selfies are more than just a trend. They are here to stay.\nWhy are selfies so popular? The appeal of selfies comes from how easy they are to create and share. And posting selfies is popular for another reason: you can control your own image. \"I like having the power to choose how I look,\" admits Samantha, a 19-year-old girl from Missouri, \"even if I'm making a face.\" Actually, the most common selfie is the one where you look cute, partly because it's a quick way to get positive comments about your appearance. \"If I feel pretty, I take one,\" says Andrew, a 23-year-old girl from Maryland, \"when other people Like   it, it's a mini boost of confidence.\"\nSure, showing off a new coat or that you're at a cool event is fun, but can be a trap to fall in. There's a danger that your self-respect may start to be tied to the comments and Likes you get when you post a selfie, and they aren't based on who you are--they are based on what you look like. Seeking validation   is totally normal, and it's a healthy way for teenagers to develop their identity. But with social networks, where it's easy to get quick approval almost constantly, the selfie thing can quickly go out of control. It may even start to feel like an addiction: when you get a \"LIKE\", you're up. But when you get nothing, your confidence can decrease quickly.\nOverall, opinions vary on selfie culture. It's up to you to shape the future of the habit. Ask yourself: are my selfies for fun, or do I need the comments? If you belong to the latter, it's recommended that you change your view. That could mean cutting selfies out entirely or just cutting down and making them more fun. So maybe you like to travel, or read or dance, or create crazy 3-D nail art...post them!
