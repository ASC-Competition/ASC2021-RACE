What they really mean is to get just enough education to give manpower for your society.\nGet a high school diploma, at least. Without that, you are occupationally dead, unless your name happens to be George Washington or Thomas Edison and you can successfully stop study in primary schools.\nGet a college degree, if possible. With a BA, you should start to find a job. You have to  _ now. If you do go for a master's degree, make sure it is an MBA and only from a first - class university. Otherwise, the famous law of diminishing   begins to work.\nDo you know, for example, that long - distance truck drivers make more money a year than full professors? Yes, each driver was paid $28,000 in 1997 while a full professor managed to get $27,930.\nA PhD is the highest degree you can get, but except in a few specialized fields such as physics or chemistry, where the degree can quickly be turned to industrial or commercial aim, you are facing a not very bright future. There are more PhDs unemployed in this country than in any other part of the world by far.\nIf you became a PhD in English or history or political science or languages or - worst of all - in philosophy , you take the risk of becoming over - educated for our national demands.\nThousands of PhDs are selling shoes, driving taxis, waiting on tables and filling out applications month after month, and then may be taking a job in some high school or college with the pay much less than a door-keeper makes.", "id": "high17720.txt"}
