When a couple goes out for an anm dinner,for example,the thought of feeling superior to others probably never comes to them. The goal is to share a special meal that stands out from other meals.\nThere are no obvious limits to the  _ of demand for quality.For example ,porsche famous car producer,has a model which was considered perhaps the best sport car on the mark Priced at over $120,000,it handles perfectly well and has great speen acceleration.But in 200 the producer introduced some changes which made the model slightly better in handling acceleration.People who really care about cars find these small improvemenmts exciting.To them,however,they must pay almost four times the price.\nBy placing the desire to be superior to other at the heart of his description of nisation demands,Keynes actually reduced such demands.However,the desire for higher quality has natural limits.", "id": "high20839.txt"}
