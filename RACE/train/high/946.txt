Pack a survival kit full with:a down coat, boots ,mittens, a hat, snow-pants,sleeping bags,candles,a flashlight,and high-energy food. If you are traveling by car , also pack extra belts, a shovel, and a chain.\nIf you are camping or hiking,make sure you know how to avoid bears.If you are lost in the wilderness, there is no doubt you will encounter them.\nHowever,there is no need to be nervous.Just take these precautions:make noise as you walk,bears will avoid you;cook your food away from where you sleep,and store your food away from where you sleep,so the bears are not attracted.Both of these should keep the bear away.However,if you do encounter a bear,there are two different schools of thought.One is to make noise and scare the bear away.The other is to stand still and speak softly to get the bear to leave.If you are dealing with a brown bear,you can climb a tree,since it cannot follow.But,black bears can climb.If for some reason the bear attacks,play dead.Try to protect your head and neck,and hopefully the bear will leave its\"dead\" prey.", "id": "high946.txt"}
