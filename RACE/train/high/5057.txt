The weather report said rain was coming, but I couldn't stay home just because of rain.\nAround 8:00 am I had a doctor's appointment. It wasn't raining then. At 9:00 I left the doctor's office to drive to work, and it was raining hard. I just had to go about 5-6 miles down one main road to get to a nearby school, where I could stay until the rain ended. Unfortunately, the road in front of the school was flooded, and my car stopped in the middle.\n\"Who is going to save me?\" I wondered. I shut off the engine and turned on my flashers  . I called 911. They were not helpful. I called my husband, even though he couldn't come and help me. I was also very close to a police station. But I never saw even one police car. I decided to get out of the car, since it was still pouring.\nMy best decision of the day had been to wear rain boots. I took my umbrella and quickly got out and ran across the street to a shelter.\nBefore long, a tow truck  happened to pass by the street. The driver kindly offered to help me. At that moment, I really needed car pulled out quickly, so I trusted the stranger. He pulled my car and drove me home. After he had dropped my car off, he also helped me check the engine. He said the engine was most likely flooded, but fortunately there was no water inside the car.\nAlthough many years have passed, I still remember that stormy day and the warm-hearted stranger clearly.", "id": "high5057.txt"}
