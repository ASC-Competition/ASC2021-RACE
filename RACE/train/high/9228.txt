One billion people are learning it and it is said that by 2050, half of the world's population will be using it. What are we talking about? That is the global language--English.\nThe English language started in Britain in the 5th century. It is a mixed language. It was built up when German. Scandinavian and French invaders settled in England and created a common language for communication.\nToday it is the official language of the UK, the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and Ireland as well as many islands in the Caribbean. Many other countries and regions use it for politics and business, for example, India. Pakistan, Nigeria and the Philippines. English is also one of the official languages of Hong Kong.\nBut global advertising and pop music mean that in most countries, you will see or hear some English. Thanks to McDonalds, we all know about \"burgers\". \"fries\" and \"milkshakes\". Songs by Madonna, Britney Spears and Celine Dion are in English. We can sing along, even if we do not understand what we are singing!\nEnglish is a messy   language. Every year, dictionaries include new words that talk about popular culture, for example, computer-related words such as \"blogging\", \"download\" and \"chartroom\". Also included are words that teenagers use. Who does not know \"cool\", \"OK\" and \"hello\"? Other languages also influence English. Many English words come from French. Words like \"cafe\" and expressions like \"c'est la vie\" (that is life) are all part of the English language. On the other hand, the French language includes English words like \"le weekend\" and \"le camping\". German words are also part of English. Words like \"kindergarten\" come from the German language.\nRecently, British people have become interested in \"yoga\". But the word comes from an ancient Hindu language in India.", "id": "high9228.txt"}
