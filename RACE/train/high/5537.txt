It shows the golden age of early Chinese culture, crafts and science, a time of great prosperity   during the Chinese Bronze Age  .\nDiscovered in 1899, Yinxu is one of the oldest and largest archeological sites   in China and is one of the historical capitals of China and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It lies in central Henan Province, near the modern city of Anyang, and is open to the public as the Garden Museum of Yinxu.

The large number of burial accessories found there shows the high level of the Shang crafts industry.\nThe site includes a main palace and an ancient tomb. Besides, there are a number of large buildings, at least 53 of which have been dug out.\nYinxu has seen many years of research, first researched by the Academia Sinica in the late 1920s to the early 1930s and most recently by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.", "id": "high5537.txt"}
