Aunt Emmy was sixty, and spent the hours she didn't spend in a bed, on a sofa or in a wheel chair; but Aunt Emmy was never heard to sigh.\n\"The gifts which money can purchase are not the only ones we can give,\" said Aunt Emmy gently, \"nor the best, either.\"\n\"Oh, I know it's nicer to give something of your own work,\" agreed Clorinda, \"but materials for fancy work cost too. That kind of gift is just as much out of the question for me as any other.\"\n\"That was not what I meant,\" said Aunt Emmy.\n\"What did you mean, then?\" asked Clorinda, looking puzzled.\nAunt Emmy smiled.\n\"Suppose you think out my meaning for yourself,\" she said. \"That would be better than if I explained it. Besides, I don't think I could explain it. Take the beautiful line of a beautiful poem to help you in your thinking out: '\n\"\n\"I'd put it the other way and say, 'The giver without the gift is bare,\" said Clorinda. \"That is my predicament exactly. Well, I hope by next Christmas I'll not be quite bankrupt. I'm going into Mr. Callender's store down at Murraybridge in February. He has offered me the place, you know.\"\n\"Won't your aunt miss you terribly?\" said Aunt Emmy gravely. \"I think she would rather have your companionship than a part of your salary, Clorinda,\" said Aunt Emmy. \"But of course you must decide for yourself, dear.\"\n\"Well, I must say bye-bye and run home.\" Clorinda lived just across the road from Aunt Emmy in a tiny white house behind some huge willows. But Aunt Mary lived there too--the only relative Clorinda had, for Aunt Emmy wasn't really her aunt at all. Clorinda had always lived with Aunt Mary ever since she could remember.\nClorinda puzzled over Aunt Emmy's meaning for days. Then all at once it came to her. On Christmas Day, Clorinda went over to Aunt Emmy's.Aunt Emmy was lying on the sofa before the fire, and Clorinda sat down beside her.\n\"I've come to tell you all about it,\" she said. \"Aunt Emmy, I thought for days over your meaning ... And then one evening it just came to me. At first I didn't think I could give some of them, and then I thought how selfish I was. I would have been willing to pay any amount of money for gifts if I had had it, but I wasn't willing to pay what I had. I got over that, though, Aunt Emmy. Now I'm going to tell you what I did give.\"\n\"First, there was old Aunt Kitty. You know she was my nurse when I was a baby. She is always glad when I go to see her, but I've never gone except when I couldn't help it. She is very deaf, and rather dull and stupid, you know. Well, I gave her a whole day. I took my knitting yesterday, and sat with her the whole time and just talked and talked. She was so pleased and proud; she told me when I came away that she hadn't had such a nice time for years. \"\n\"Then there was ... Florence. You know, Aunt Emmy, we were always intimate friends until last year. Then Florence once told Rose Watson something I had told her\n. I found it out and I was so hurt. I couldn't forgive Florence, and I told her plainly I could never be a real friend to her again. Florence felt badly, because she really did love me, and she asked me to forgive her, but it seemed as if I couldn't. Well, Aunt Emmy, that was my Christmas gift to her ... my forgiveness.\"\n\"I gave Aunt Mary her gift this morning. I told her I wasn't going to Murraybridge, that I just meant to stay home with her. She was so glad--and I'm glad, too, now that I've decided so.\"\n\"Your gifts have been real gifts, Clorinda,\" said Aunt Emmy. \"Something of you--the best of you--went into each of them.\"\n\"I didn't forget you, Aunt Emmy,\" she said, as she unpinned the paper.\nThere was a rosebush. Aunt Emmy loved flowers. She put her finger under one of the roses and kissed it.\n\"It's as sweet as yourself, dear child,\" she said tenderly. \"And it will be a joy to me all through the lonely winter days. You've found out the best meaning of Christmas giving, haven't you, dear?\"\n\"Yes, thanks to you, Aunt Emmy,\" said Clorinda softly.", "id": "high16437.txt"}
