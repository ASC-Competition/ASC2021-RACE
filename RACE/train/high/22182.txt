It is very good for your health and also brings happiness to you. To be a successful fruit-and-vegetable grower, check out these tips: \n*A family affair \n       Get all family members to take part in growing. Children will learn where food comes from, and they may like to have their own little field. \n*Size doesn't matter\n        You can work in any place you like, not just in a common vegetable garden. Grow fruit and vegetables in a window box, or use your flowerbed   to grow vegetables and beautiful flowers together. \n*The natural way\n        If you want to grow foods organically, you can't use sprays   that would harm children, pets and wildlife. You should work with nature rather than against it.\n        Growing your own food doesn't take up too much time and costs little. A few seeds and some basic tools will be OK. Second-hand tools can often be both cheap and good to use.", "id": "high22182.txt"}
