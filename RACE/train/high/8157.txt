He visits the house where he lived as a child. Here, he remembers the most important memories of his childhood. Standing in front of his old house, the young man makes an important decision. He says to himself, \"I will start my life over again. I will become a writer.\"\nThis man is the world famous writer, Gabriel Garcia Marquez.\nGabriel Garcia Marquez was born on March 6, 1928. During his early life, Garcia Marquez's grandmother and grandfather told him many stories. His grandmother would tell him legends as if they were real. Garcia Marquez says that his grandmother's way of storytelling later influenced his own methods.\nWhen Garcia Marquez was about 20 years old, he left Aractataca and attended university in Bogota. He began studying law because this was what his father wanted him to study. However, Garcia Marquez was not happy.\nDuring this time Garcia Marquez returned to Aractataca. It was on this visit that he realized he must stop studying law. And he recognized that he must return to the dream of his childhood-writing. For the next few years, Garcia Marquez wrote for many different newspapers. And in 1955, he published his first book called \"Leaf Storm\".\nFor many years, Garcia Marquez knew he wanted to write about his grandfather's house in Aractataca. To write this book, Garcia Marquez and his wife had to sell almost all of their possessions to survive. But their act was worth it. The book, \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" was immediately successful. And this book created a path for Garcia Marquez's future success.\nIn 1982, Gabriel Garcia Marquez was given the Nobel Prize in Literature for his book \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", making him the first Colombian and the fourth Latin American to win a Nobel Prize in Literature.", "id": "high8157.txt"}
