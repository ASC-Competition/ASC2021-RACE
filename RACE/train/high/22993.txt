I wanted to do something kind for someone else without any reason and purpose, almost as if I was just trying to spread the abundance   of love I was receiving.\nIt was then that I saw a teenage girl dressed in  _ clothes, getting soaked . She wasn't wearing any shoes or socks. The rain wet her skin through the holes in her clothes and she was making her way through the garbage, trying to find something that would be of use to her.\nI walked towards her and told her to wait for me there while I ran home to get her something. On getting home, I took off my shoes, which I really loved, wrapped them up in a plastic cover and ran to give them to the teenage girl on the street. \nThe girl looked surprised as if she was not used to this kind of kindness.  She thanked me in a trembling   voice.\nA famous musician who lives down the street corner stopped his car and smiled when he saw what happened. The two watchmen who saw me do this talked and gave me friendly looks.\nAlthough I had to wear my dad's shoes, I was satisfied even if they were a bit large for my feet, because I knew the girl would walk comfortably wearing the shoes. That day I learned that letting go of the little things we own can be a big help to others.", "id": "high22993.txt"}
