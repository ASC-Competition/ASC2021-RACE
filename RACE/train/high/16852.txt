This contrast is beginning to bother your 6-year-old son. You are worried that he will want to live as they do, and wonder if you should move.\nSometimes big pocket money, joyful birthday parties, special playrooms and super-big houses tell you that your neighbors probably have more money than you do, and that they're not as careful as you are with money, but you may find that they cook and dig in the garden with their children just as often as you do, talk with them as freely and read to them every night.\nOr you may find that some of these parents stay in one wing of their big house while their child plays by himself, way off in a wing of his own. In that unfortunate case, he is basically growing up alone without being looked after properly, but this can happen to a child who lives in a normal-size house, too, if he has a TV, a computer and a few video games in his room. Even the most caring parent doesn't walk in and out of it to see what show her child is watching, what Internet site he has found and if he's still playing that video game.\nToo much uncontrolled screen time may lead to a certain loss of innocence ,but mostly this child will lose the sense of unity and satisfaction, and if it doesn't , you might decide to move. Don't judge your neighborhood too harshly ,though. There are some things that are right with almost any neighborhood and some things that are wrong with the best of them--like those super-big houses.\nThe wealth of their owners--and the way they throw money around--may make your son feel sorry for himself, unless you help him understand that you and his dad save some of the money, give some to people who don't have enough and use the rest to pay for whatever the family needs.\nChildren want--should be provided with--explanations when their parents don't give them what they want.", "id": "high16852.txt"}
