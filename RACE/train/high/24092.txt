If you wanted to learn about polar bears for a science class report,for example,you could use the  _ setting to get basic information about the animals.On the \"expert\" setting,on the other hand.you could get much more detailed information about the history,literature,and exploration of polar bears. \nIt now takes years for scientists to collect all the data they need to describe and analyze species.The creators of the Encyclopedia of Life hope that their new tool will speed that process. \nKeep an eye on  _ .Pages will begin to go up sometime next year,and you might find them useful for your school reports.The EOL team might have the basics for all 1.8 million entries online as early as 2017.Someday,you might add your own notes.", "id": "high24092.txt"}
