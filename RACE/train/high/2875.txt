Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica.\nIn this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs.\nTree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape.\nIf hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water.", "id": "high2875.txt"}
