Nurses are under more and more pressure.\"\n   Ms Irwin added, \"Only 22% of all nurses disagree that they are under too much pressure.\"\n   She also said that 27% of nurses had a second job, with the main reason that they needed some extra income.\n   \"Nurses have made it clear that while they enjoy their work, they have more to do than ever and are not being paid enough to do it.\" She added. \" For this reason, the RCN is calling for a pay increase for nurses to bring their pay into line with others.\"\n   The survey of 4,795 nurses found that some important changes to the profession had taken place in recent years. The average age of the nurses questioned was 42 ---compared to an average of 33 in 1987. The RCN said that the age increase was because people were now becoming nurses later. In the 1960s, the average age of a nurse on the completion of training was 21, but over the last 5 years it has been an average of 29.", "id": "high17297.txt"}
