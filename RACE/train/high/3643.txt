Sheltering them from the realities of war is a great disservice.\nUnderstanding why conflicts happened, or happen today, can help shape choices and decisions they make as adults.\nOf course, because we live in a free society, we cannot force an individual to do something. _ is unfortunate, but some parents now have their child \"opt-out\" of the services. These people should be reminded they are free to make such choices only because of the men and women the rest of us are remembering.", "id": "high3643.txt"}
