It does not help them build self-confidence.\nMost parents and teachers agree that praise can help increase children's self-confidence --the more, the better. However, according to some researchers, only proper praise is good for children. If adults praise everything children do, it makes children look for praise all the time, not trying to do their best. \"Teachers should not say things like 'good job' or 'nice work' whenever a child does anything. They should encourage them to continue to improve,\" some researchers advise.\nAnother idea is that children with high self-confidence are happier, and do better at school. About this, Marshall Duke, a researcher in children, says, \"High self-confidence brought in by too much praise does not make children happier, get more, or become able to do more. Finding a child's advantages   and developing them can help build confidence more than too much praise can.\" Praise also loses its effect   if it is given equally to all students.\n\"It's important to tell children the truth about what they've done. Honest feedback   is far better than empty praise,\" Duke adds. \"People have got into the habit of not telling children when they're wrong. That makes it hard for them to deal with difficulties when they grow up. That's just how the world is.\"", "id": "high2984.txt"}
