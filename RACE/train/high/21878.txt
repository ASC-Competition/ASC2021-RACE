When I look back on my career, I realize the road to becoming a CEO isn't a straight, clearly clarified path. In fact, no two paths are the same. But whether you want to be a boss one day or not, there's a lot to learn from how leaders rise to the top of successful companies. \n         As this series of stories shows, the paths to becoming a CEO may vary, but the people in that position share the qualities of commitment , work ethic  and a strong desire for building something new. And every CEO take risks along the way--putting your life savings on the line to start a software company or leaving a big business to be one of the first employees at a startup.\n         I grew up in Minnesota, and learned how to be an entrepreneur from my father, who has run a small business for almost 30 years.

Figure out what makes you do so. What gives you a really big rush? Answer why you like things, not what you like doing...and then apply it to your work life. Also, just because you're graduating , don't stop learning. Read more books than you did in college. If you do, and they're not, you're really well in a position to succeed in whatever you do.", "id": "high21878.txt"}
