I ordered a hot cup of coffee, and began observing people. \n  Some people were having dinner in the great hall, which made me consider an early dinner. At that time, I observed a man seated nearby and, from his eager eyes, I realized that he noticed the delicious food. His tired body and worn clothes shouted, \"Homeless, homeless!\"\n     I wondered how long it had been since he had eaten. I expected him to approach me for a handout  . He never did. A silent war broke out in my head --one side was telling me to mind my own business, and the other was urging me to offer him the food. \n     While my inner debate moved on, a well-dressed young couple walked up to him. \"Excuse me, sir,\" the husband began. \"We just finished eating, and our appetites weren't as big as we thought. We hate to waste good food. Can you help us out and put this to use?\" He gave the man some food. \"Thank you. Merry Christmas!\" the man replied. The man carefully watched his new food, and was about to drink the soup and eat the food seriously. \n     Something that happened next shocked me. An old man, with pants, an old jacket and open shoes, entered the hall and walked to our direction. The man who was just offered the food saw the situation. Setting aside his meal, he stood up and guided the old man to the table. Then he put his worn jacket over the old man's shoulders.\n     \"Hi, my name's Jack,\" he said, \"and one kind person brought me this meal. I just finished eating and hate to waste good food. Can you help me out?\" The old man answered gratefully, \"Sure, but only if you go halfway with me on that sandwich.\"\n     I left the restaurant that day feeling warmer than I had ever thought possible.", "id": "high21923.txt"}
