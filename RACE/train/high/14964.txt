It was not a gold medal, or a world record broken, but a show of pure courage and determination.\nThe event was swimming. I watched a man dive off the blocks and knew right away that something was wrong. I'm not an expert swimmer, but I can tell a good dive from a poor one, and this was not exactly medal quality. When he resurfaced, it was evident that the man was not out for gold -- his arms were waving in an attempt at freestyle.\nI heard the crowd begin to laugh at this poor man who was clearly having a hard time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was pitiful. He made a few desperate strokes   and you could tell he was worn out. But in those few awkward strokes, the crowd changed. No longer were they laughing, but beginning to cheer. Some even began to stand and yell things like, \"Come on, you can do it!\" He did. The crowd went wild.\nJust a short year ago, he had never even swum, let alone race. His country had been invited to take part in the event. Even though he recorded the slowest time, this man gave more heart than any of the other competitors--a man that gave his all, knowing that he had no chance but to compete because of the spirit of the games.", "id": "high14964.txt"}
