It was far from the towns and cities and there were some high mountains around. Of course it was a good place for training the new soldiers. But it was difficult for the young men to go outside. Mr. White, an officer of forty, was strict with them and he hardly let them leave the camp.\nOnce Mr. White was ill in bed. He couldn't work and a young officer, Mr. Hunt began to train the new soldiers instead of him. He knew the young men well and let nine soldiers go to the nearest town to have a holiday. But night fell and none came back to the camp. He was worried about it and stood at the gate. It was five to twelve when Mr. Hunt decided to go to the town and see what was happening to the young men. He started the car quickly and set off. At that moment the nine soldiers came back. It seemed they drank wine. Of course they found the officer was angry.\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\"said the first soldier.\"I left the town on time. But something was wrong with my bus on my way here. I had to buy a horse and made it run fast. Bad luck! It died and I had to run back.\"\nAnd the other seven soldiers said they were late for the same reasons. It was the last soldier's turn. He said, \"I'm sorry, sir. I got on a bus on time, but...\"\nHaving heard this, the officer became even angrier and stopped him at once. He called out, \"If you say something was wrong with your bus, I'll punish you at once!\"\n\"No, no, sir,\" said the young man. \"My bus was all right, but the horse died!\"", "id": "high5021.txt"}
