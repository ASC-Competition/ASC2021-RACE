Grist often started her appeal with something such as,\"I hope you don't think I'm crazy,but...\" Yet she was _ by the positive response--so much so that in August 2008, she began to contact officials in various levels of government, companies and other institutions in an effort to reach a wider audience.\nThrough a local Mac's Convenience Store,Grist managed to contact the company that produces content displayed on their in store monitors.That led to a public service announcement about litter that ran in almost 600 Mac's stores in Ontario from November 2008 to June 2009. Grist continues to explore every opportunity she has to get the message out.Her grassroots campaign may be different,but she has begun to open people's eyes about the problem of litter.And thanks to her efforts,in Mississauga,at least,they have begun to do just that.", "id": "high2207.txt"}
