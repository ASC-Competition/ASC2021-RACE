In the 1980s the ides that a car would \"talk\" to its driver was science fiction; by the 1990s it had become reality.\n       On board navigation was one of the new automotive technologies in the 1990s. By using the satellite-aided global positioning system(GPS), a computer in the automobile can pinpoint the car's location within a few feet. The onboard navigation system uses and electronic compass ,digitized maps , and a display screen showing where the car is   to the destination the driver wants to reach. After being told the destination, the computer locates it and directs the driver to it , offering alternative routes if needed.\n       Some cars now come equipped with GPS locator beacons ,enabling a GPS system operator to locate the vehicle ,map its location and ,if necessary ,direct repair or emergency workers to the scene.\n       Gars equipped with computers and cellular telephones can link to the Internet to obtain constantly updated traffic reports ,weather information, route directions ,and other data .Future built-in computer systems may be used to automatically get business information over the Internet and manage personal affairs while the vehicle's owner is driving.", "id": "high22959.txt"}
