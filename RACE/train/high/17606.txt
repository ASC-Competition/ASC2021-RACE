However, male nurses possess some unique features.\" \nIn some high-pressure and fast-paced working environments, such as operating rooms or emergency rooms, male nurses definitely have an advantage as well, Deng said. \"It's difficult for a female nurse to turn over a paralyzed patient by herself in an intensive care unit. And during natural disasters, earthquakes for example, male nurses also play a vital role in rescuing victims and providing healthcare in a dangerous environment.\"\nMen make up only 1,900 of the 69,000 registered nurses in the capital, and they mainly work in the departments that are \"labor-demanding\", according to the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. \n\"I've seen so many male nurses quit or resign in the past few years,\" he said. \"With a basic salary of around 1,500 yuan, most male nurses simply find themselves cornered.\" \n\"Many students even reject their identity as a male nurse, out of the long-existing discrimination,\" Zhao said. \"But nursing truly needs the male because of their rational thinking, physical strength and calmness in face of emergency and disasters.\" \nNothing will change \"until the public changes its attitude and nurses' pay is raised\", he said.", "id": "high17606.txt"}
