About a year and a half ago a 59-year-old lady came to us who had cancer. She had to have her right leg amputated and she didn't have a family to take care of her after the operation.\nThis lady was a quiet lady who mostly stayed alone. But in the afternoons, when she was feeling well, she would go to visit the other people in the Care Center. She would visit a lady who was blind and read to her. She would go into the room of a young girl with severe cerebral palsy and sing to her. In her quiet and gentle way, she would go about the Care Center doing goods.\nShe passed away last Wednesday and after her passing, stories are coming forward of her quiet acts of kindness in her own hour of sorrow.\nWe never know what  _ we have upon others. She had every reason to be bitter, to be angry, or to be swallowed up in her own grief. But she wasn't. She didn't have a family and probably felt forgotten, but her small and quiet acts of service made an impact upon the entire Care Center.\nEach of us feels better than before for having known her. We have pledged to be more aware of the service that we can offer to others.", "id": "high20932.txt"}
