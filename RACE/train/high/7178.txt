Early childhood education primarily focuses on learning through playing to develop the child's physical , sensory , communicational and social development . Early childhood education has become a concern of the government , who pushes poor children to be formally trained before they are old enough for kindergarten .\nThere are good reasons for the government to push early childhood education . Studies have shown that orphaned children   who did not receive good care and education become developmentally delayed causing failure in school , and even in life. Further studies show that poor children who take part in Head Start programs are more prepared for school , less likely to end up in Special Education classes , and are less likely to receive public help or go to jail (prison) .\nThere are also negative parts to putting a child in formal education programs too early . Time Magazine Online explains that \" the younger the child is , the less his chances of catching up with first-grade work .\" I have personally witnessed many children of my generation who went to Head Start programs become frustrated and bored with school before they finished high school . Yet parents have been sure that the earlier the child starts school , the better off he or she is , so they push to start children earlier .\nActually while early formal education of poor children does show great gains in the early elementary years , studies also show that this head start is really a \" false start\" , as the gains are lost in middle and high school years. It seems that environment is a bigger factor on life's success than early education . Head Start programs have not achieved its original goal in closing the achievement gap in poor and middle school children. Perhaps it is time to find other ways to close that gap .", "id": "high7178.txt"}
