Not only have transport delays hindered personal trips, but they have also slowed the delivery of fresh produce to markets. Consequently, in Zhengzhou, the capital city of the Henan province, tomato prices have doubled, and the cost of 47 other vegetables has increased by 36%, as reported by local media at the end of January.\nAccording to an inside PR source, \"wholesalers in Beijing were quoted as saying that only about 20% of the usual fresh vegetable supplies were reaching the city.\" As an Asian country with a diet based on fresh produce, the shortage of vegetables and the rise in prices is not only affecting fresh food producers, but also the final consumers.\nIn terms of production, this is the worst snow disaster to hit China in the last 50 years, affecting a total of 9.4 million hectares of farmland in the country, according to a report published on 4 February 2008 by Feng Tao of Xinhua News, at the Chinese government website. Most of the crops devastated by the frost are located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the traditional natural border between North and South China.\nChen Xiwen, Director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Rural Work, pointed out at the end of last week that \"the blizzard disaster in the south has had a severe impact on winter crops, and the impact on fresh vegetables could be catastrophic in certain areas\", as stated in the Xinhua News report.\nThe Chinese government has been quick to take extreme measures. The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has sent 13 teams of experts to 8 of the areas most seriously affected by the harsh weather. The aim of this initiative is to provide farmers with technical assistance to minimize their losses.", "id": "high7516.txt"}
