Since then I have used the money in the U.K. and the U.S and have helped some strangers, generally raising a lot of smiles. They have warmed my heart, but none so much as the gift I was able to give just an hour ago.\nI was in a shop looking at the second-hand books. It just so happened that the bookshelves were next to the toy section. After a few minutes I became aware of a group of women standing behind me. They were poorly dressed and spoke in what sounded like an eastern European language.\nAs the little girl, about three years old, came over to the toy section, immediately her attention was caught by a toy. She spoke to her mother and in halting  English her mother asked the shop assistant how much it cost. PS3 was the answer. \nThe mum looked down at her child, perhaps calculating what she still had to buy and how much money she would have left. Then she simply shook her head. The child didn't react badly as some children might. Being told no was obviously not a new experience for her. But she couldn't keep the disappointment from her face.\nI had the total of four pounds in my pocket, two PS2 coins. A moment later, I tapped the mother on the shoulder, and pointed to the coins which I had left and said, \"Buy her a dolly, too.\" I didn't hang about to see the end result. _ . I made my way out of the shop and into the sunshine.\nThe money my friend gave me was an investment in the happiness of the world. Was there any better way, I wondered, to get so much happiness with so little money than to buy a toy for a little girl?", "id": "high23424.txt"}
