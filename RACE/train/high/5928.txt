However, no one has ever shot a film that plants themselves can watch until now. In a New York art gallery, seven house plants have spent the last seven weeks watching Strange Skies, the first travel documentary for a vegetable audience. All the plants sat in the cinema in rows, enjoying themselves in Italian sunshine.\nThe movie was made by American artist Jonathon Keats. It consists of Italian skies recorded over two months and made into a six-minute-long movie. The film shows the clear dawn , high clouds, amazing dusk and then beautiful night. The movie has no sound and the plants, of course, do not applaud. But Stephen Squibb, a professor from Harvard University, said these plants could benefit from it--the light of the movie keeps them alive because they can continue the process of turning light into energy.\n\"I realized there was a much larger audience--plants--that were not being serviced, \"Keats said. \"I wanted to provide plants with entertainment that companies such as Disney provide for humans. \"Meanwhile, Keats also wants to explore plants' sensibilities further. He plans to open a\"restaurant for plants\"at a Californian museum.\nOne visitor, photographer Abbas Ebrahimi, admired the green audience, \"Plants are better than us. We die and go, while in spring they come back each time. \"But when talking about the movie, he said after thinking for a few minutes, \"It doesn't mean anything to me at all. It's just about light. For some people, it might mean something. \"", "id": "high5928.txt"}
