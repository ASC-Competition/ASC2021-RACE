When Nazi Germany is featured in these films, cruel Nazi officers and brutal concentration  camps most often represent it. But the new Hollywood movie Valkyrie tells a different story, \"a chapter of German history which is little known abroad\", according to the German Cultural Minister Bernd Neumann.\nValkyrie is based on a true incident that took place in 1944. Colonel  Stauffenberg had been a loyal soldier for his entire military career. However, after losing an eye, a hand, and three fingers in an Allied bombing,  _ . The destruction that his country had brought to its European neighbors had become too terrible for the colonel to bear in silence. He hoped that someone would find a way to stop Adolf Hitler, one of the most evil tyrants  the world has ever known. Realizing that time was running out, he decided that he must take action himself and joined the German resistance. These men drew up Operation Valkyrie, a plot to assassinate  Hitler and to overthrow his Nazi government from the inside. This plot is what the film is named after and focuses on.\nThe Hollywood star Tom Cruise plays the lead role. \"This was a very challenging film to make. We carried a huge responsibility to correctly portray history,\" Cruise said.\nHowever, the production has drawn criticism for lacking depth and for simplifying the motives behind the plot.", "id": "high16651.txt"}
