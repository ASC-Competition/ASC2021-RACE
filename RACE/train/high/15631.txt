I now regret my decision. As someone needs to have a clean, tidy house, I no longer feel relaxed in my own home. If I tell her, \"sorry, the cat has to go.\" She will be heartbroken. What can I do?\n-Feline Phobic\nDear Phobic,\nI'm an animal lover and on your kid's and cat's side. Tell your daughter your problem. Ask her to help you come up with a plan. Perhaps you can agree to allow the cat only in certain areas of the house. This is a chance for your daughter to develop the sense of responsibility owning a pet requires.\nDear Aunty,\nI got the highest grade on a biology test. Now the popular kids think I'm\n, and want me in their lab group. I knew I was being used. Now, they want my homework. What should I do?\n-Lily\nDear Lily,\nPopularity can come at a price, but it's no excuse to cheat. Offer to help new friends with their homework, but don't give them yours.\nDear Aunty,\nI'm one of six assistants in a dental  office. But I'm new there just four months. I've tried to join conversations, but they just ignore me. They go shopping together. No one invites me. How can I break into the circle?\n-Crystal\nDear Crystal,\nHumans run in packs like dogs. When a new dog enters the pack, a lot of discovery goes on. So bring cookies for everyone! Then try making friends with one co-worker. Invite her to lunch. When you get familiar with each other, tell her how hard you're finding the situation at work. Chances are, she'll take you under her wing.", "id": "high15631.txt"}
