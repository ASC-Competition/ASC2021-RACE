The number is said to be as high as 60% in Germany.\n\"Women often wish they had the same chances as men have, and think it is still men's world. \" said Dr. James Helen, one of the sociologists who did the study.\nMany men say that they have more duties than women. A man has to make money to support his family and to make the important decision, so it is right for men to be paid more. Some are even against their wives working at all. When wives go out to work, they say, the home and children cannot be taken good care of. If women take full-time jobs, they won't be able to do what they are best at doing: making a nice home and bringing up the children.\nSome women disagree. They say they want to get out of their homes and to have freedom to choose between work and home life. Women have the right of equal pay and equal chances.\nAnne Harper has a very good job. She also believes in \"Women's Liberation\", \"I don't wish I were a man,\" she says, \"and I don't think many women do. But I do wish people would stop treating us like second-class people. At work, for example, we usually do the work that men do but get paid less. There are still a lot of jobs only to men--usually they are the best ones. If you are a man, you have a much better chance of living a wonderful life. How many women scientists are there...or engineers?\"", "id": "high7876.txt"}
