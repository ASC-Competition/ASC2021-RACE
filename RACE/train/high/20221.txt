Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.\n    In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.\n    Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.\n    These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.\n    The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars.", "id": "high20221.txt"}
