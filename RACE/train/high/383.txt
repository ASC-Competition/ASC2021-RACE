This year, it's Wi-Fi-enabled laundry machines and fridges that can tell you when your groceries are going bad.\nThe washers and dryers, available starting in the spring, connect to any smartphone through a downloadable application. The phone can then be used as a remote control, so the machines can be turned on and off while their owners is at work or on the bus.\nSamsung says it's not just something new -- the app connection actually has some practical uses.\n\"If you started to dry clothes in the morning and forgot to take them out, you can go to your phone and restart your dryer for the time when come home, so your clothes are refreshed and ready to go,\" said spokesperson Amy Schmidt.\nThe company also says that with electricity rate varying depending on the time of day, more control over when the machines are used can help save money.\nPerhaps, but what they will probably really accomplish is what all good technologies do --enable laziness. Rather than getting up to check on whether the laundry is done, users will instead monitor it on their phones while watching TV.", "id": "high383.txt"}
