We pick four great trips for September.\nSicily\nSeptember is the loveliest month of the year to visit Sicily. It's the perfect time, for the sea is still warm and there are fewer crowds. Besides, the weather is pleasant enough to walk around enjoyable, sandy-coloured towns without working up too much of a sweat. In addition, there are food festivals.\nLyon  \nLyon perhaps has more attractive restaurants per square kilometre than anywhere else in Europe. That alone is reason to visit, but  _ . The largest preserved Renaissance area in Europe, home to the Lumiere brothers, a centre for fashion designers, Roman ruins and a changing arts scene. The only thing Lyon hasn't got many of is tourists. Visit mid-September and you'll hit the launch of the 11th Biennale of contemporary art when 70 artists from around the world will exhibit their work.\nIsle of Skye\nOn 10 September, the Celeste, a sailing boat covered in 60,000 inch-square mirror tiles , will stop in Portree where it will broadcast songs and stories from the island. Visitors can tune into the stories on Cuillin FM, while having a walk. The Celeste is the main point of Bonnie Boat , a whole day of art and events, including designer craft ,film screenings, dance performances, and sailing workshops.\nIceland\nTravel there in September and you can join local farmers in annual ceremony of gathering up thousands of sheep from the mountains of south Iceland for winter. For experienced horse riders it is a great way to meet locals and enjoy a way of life that has little changed in centuries. A similar ceremony rounding up horses takes place at the end of the month in the northwest around the Vatnsdalur valley.", "id": "high21463.txt"}
