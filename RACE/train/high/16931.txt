Or a business card that looks like a notepad? No kidding.\nBai Minghui, a Beijing-based designer, creates his artwork using Tyvek, a synthetic  paper material which is difficult to tear, waterproof and, more importantly, totally recyclable.\nBorn to a worker family in 1983 in Tangshan, Hebei Province, Bai worked as a graphic designer at a financial magazine in Beijing after graduating from Minzu University of China.\nIn the spring of 2008, Bai visited an exhibition about Tyvek in Beijing's 798 art zone, and then worked with the material, trying to bring his designs to life. The first thing that came into his mind was the paper wallet, a must-try handicraft assignment that most Chinese students do in elementary school.\n\"A paper wallet is definitely more useful than a paper crane or frog,\" Bai told Beijing Review, smiling. \"At first, many people have no idea what it is, because it looks like a piece of newspaper or an express parcel receipt, and feels like real paper. But it's hard to tear.\"\n\"The completed, folded wallet is seamless , which creates so much fun for a designer. To be honest, I didn't think about profits at all,\" he said.\nAfter months of research and development on printing and designing, the first generation of his paper wallet made a stunning debut in May 2008. The second generation, which offers a greater range of pattern options, was put on the market at the beginning of 2009.\n\"You can have graffiti or write down phone numbers on it, or paint whatever you like. I would like people to be able to use it easily,\" he said. \"I don't want to do things without creative ideas. Now my focus is on how to create better design rather than the wallet itself.\"", "id": "high16931.txt"}
