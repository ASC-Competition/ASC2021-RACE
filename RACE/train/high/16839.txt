But does it feel like your parents are stressing you out with their love? Do you often fight with them?\n  Hu Muqing, 16, of Shenyang, complains that his parents only care about his grades and not his other needs. He and his parents fight the most about the time he spends watching TV and on the Internet. \"They think because I'm in high school I should concentrate on my work,\" the Shenyang teenager said. \"However, I need to be able to relax. Most of my friends can watch TV and surf the Web a lot. There are times when it's hard to talk to them.\" After some talks, Hu has been allowed to watch TV for 15 to 20 minutes every night, but has been told to keep away from the computer. \nSince she feels she's grown up now, Shen Ying, 17, wants more respect from her parents. \"My father shouts at me when he's in a bad mood  . He doesn't listen to me, but instead acts like, 'I'm the boss'!\" said the teenager from Mianyang, Sichuan province. \"I'd like my parents to treat me like a friend and understand that respect is a two-way street.\"\n    \"It's the age when teenagers are becoming more independent  . But their parents are very concerned   about their kids' futures,\" said Sun Yunxiao, a senior researcher at the China Youth and Children Research Center. Sun suggests that teenagers should learn to communicate with their parents effectively  .\n  \"Find the right time for a talk. On Mother's Day or Father's Day, say 'Thank you' to your parents or give them a small gift with a letter so they can get inside your head a little,\" he advised. Sun also believes that teenagers have to work to earn trust and respect from their parents.\n \"You need to make sure they know that you're not going to screw up your exams or let them down. Let them know that you want to do well, and that you will do well,\" he said.", "id": "high16839.txt"}
