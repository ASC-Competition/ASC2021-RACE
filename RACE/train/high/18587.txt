Book reports tend to be a little more descriptive (What is this book about?) and book reviews are usually more persuasive (Why a reader should or shouldn't read this book?). They are both a way to think more deeply about a book you've read and to present your understanding.\n    Most teachers have their own requirements they expect you to meet, so be sure to check, but the following general elements  of a book report should be helpful.\nIntroduction\nHere you want to provide basic information about the book, and a sense of what your report will be about. You should include:\nTitle /Author\nPublication Information: publisher, year, number of pages\nWriting style\nA brief introduction to the book and the report.\nBody\nThere are two main sections for this part. The first is an explanation of what the book is about. The second is your opinions about the book and how successful it is. There are some differences between reports on fiction or other imaginative writing and reports on non-fiction books. But for both, a good place to start is to explain the author's purpose and/or the main themes of the book. Then you can summarize.\nFor fiction or other creative writing:\nProvide brief descriptions of the setting, the point of view, the leading character, and other major characters. If there is an obvious mood or tone, discuss that as well. Give a brief plot summary. Along with the order of major events, you may want to discuss the book's climax  . \nFor non-fiction:\nProvide a general overview of the author's topic, main points, and argument. What is the argument? What are the important conclusions?\nDon't try to summarize each chapter. Choose the ones that are most important and interesting to you.\nAnalysis and comment\nIn this second section you analyze the book. You can write about your own opinions; just be sure that you explain and support them with examples. Some questions you might want to consider: Did the author achieve his or her purpose? Is the writing effective, powerful or beautiful? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the book? For non-fiction, do you agree with the author's arguments and conclusions? What is your general response to the book? Did you find it interesting, moving or dull? Would you recommend it to others? Why or why not?\nConclusion\nBriefly conclude by pulling your thoughts together. You may want to say what impression the book left you with, or emphasize what you want your reader to know about it.", "id": "high18587.txt"}
