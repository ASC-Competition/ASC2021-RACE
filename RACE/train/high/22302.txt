Don't worry! You can buy more from Harli Jordean.\n  Harli Jordean, the 8-year-old kid, soon to be 9, is just too lovely. He was born in Stoke Newington, London in spring 2003. He started up an Internet marble company where he sells the toys. And recently the 8-year-old student was written into the record books for being the youngest founder and chief executive officer   (CEO) of an Internet company.\n  Harli's love for marbles got rolling when he was 6. According to Tina, Harli's mother, he loved the colcorful toys so much that he would go to sleep talking about marbles and the first thing in the morning he did was talking about marbles. And his family started calling him \"the Marble King\".\n  \"I like the patterns   and designs of marbles. You can collect hundreds of different color1s, shaps, and sizes. It's fun,\" Harli told WR News. \"And I really enjoy looking at them, touching them, holding them, studying them and playing them with my friends.\"\n  Harli Jordean's marble company has a long history. After losing his marbles to an older boy, Harli and his mom turned to the Internet for ordering more marbles. However, they couldn't find a Web site that sold the toys. That gave Harli an idea-to start a Web site where people could find different types of marbles. With his family's help, Harli created a Web site that sells marbles and marble accessories. His collection includes tiny and large marbles, along with clear and color1ful ones.\n  Since starting his business, Harli has learned how to work with marble suppliers and fill orders. In the past two years, he's received orders from customers around the world. Some of the countries where he has sold the most marbles are Brazil, Italy, and the United States. Most kids just love marbls!\n  So how does Harli feel about being the world's youngest CEO?\n  \"It feels marvelous  . I like having my own company. I like being the boss,\" he says. \"It really ...surprised me and probably ... my teachers too. I don't think they believed me when I used to say to them 'I have a marble business'!\"", "id": "high22302.txt"}
