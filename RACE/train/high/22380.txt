When she took a summer job, her mother, Kim Guidry, was confident her daughter would get good life experience. And Chelsea wanted to make her own money and be more independent. Kim didn't worry about her daughter because she'd known the store owner for years. Chelsea did such a good job that when summer ended she was asked to stay on and even open and close the shop sometimes. That was when Kim started feeling uneasy. \"She'd be there alone with a drawer full of money for the first or last 20 minutes of her shift ,\"  says Kim. \"If she was opening, I'd drop her off to lock the door the minute she got into the building, and I'd wait in the car until the owner arrived. If she was closing, I'd arrive 20 minutes early. You can never be too careful.\"\nKim's concerns were natural. Even though the 6 million American teens who hold job benefit a lot -- learning to manage money, developing time-management skills, and becoming good at problem-solving with other people -- they face some dangers as well. About 230  000 teen workers are injured yearly, from burns and cuts in restaurant kitchens to falls from roofs on buildings. Deaths, fortunately, are rare, but they do happen -- between 60 and 70 each year, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\nBut for most teens and their parents, the pay-offs of working do more good than harm. So help your teens get most out of employment with these stay-safe tips.", "id": "high22380.txt"}
