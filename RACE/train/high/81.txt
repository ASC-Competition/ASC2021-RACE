If you ask what is going on, someone will tell you it's a charity activity.\nThough this charity program has not yet officially begun for Chinese users, this little green symbol has proven popular among Chinese Windows Live Messenger users.\nWindows Live Messenger's official blog announced on March 1 that Microsoft was beginning an \"I'm\" program in the United States. Every time someone starts a conversation using \"I'm\", Microsoft shares a part of the program's advertising income with nine organizations devoted to social causes. With every instant message a user sends, it helps deal with things one feels most interested in, including poverty, child protection, disease and worsening environment.\nOne only has to add a certain code next to one's name for the organization one would like to support. \"*red'u\" is for the American Red Cross, \"*bgca\" is for Boys & Girls Clubs of America and \"*unicef\" stands for the American branch of UNICEF.\nAfter a Chinese blogger named \"hung\" introduced this program on his blog on March 2, \"I'm\" entered the Internet in China with no actual support from Microsoft.\nBeijing-based Youth Weekend reported that famous IT blogger Keso regarded this program's rapid spread as a successful virus marketing case. He thinks that the success of the \"I'm\" program is because it's spread by users without being a bother to others. This answers why \"I'm\" has spread so rapidly across the Internet like a virus with almost no advertisement.\nHowever, Feng Jinhu from the press center for Microsoft China toldYouth Weekendthat the \"I'm\" project is only for Messenger users in the United States. Instant messages sent by Chinese users would not count.\nThis has not affected Chinese Messenger users' interest in the little green symbol. These users hope their instant messages will actually contribute to charitable organizations someday.", "id": "high81.txt"}
