Most local people won't rise for another five hours, but Ka-sim Morris, 44, is up and out at 2 am. He paints over graffiti , looks out for criminal activity, or installs new waterlines. At about 5 am, Morris takes a quick coffee break and watches for the community's first signs of life. \n    \"If I won the lottery, I would still stay in my community and keep my job,\" Morris confesses. He is the maintenance supervisor for the Adams Avenue Business Association, one of San Diego's 16 Business Improvement Districts (BIDS).\n    A BID is an area in which local businesses agree to pay higher taxes to help rebuild the community. The extra money from higher taxes is used to support neighborhood activities such as installing streetlights, removing graffiti, planting trees, and paying people like Morris, who complete the tasks that help make the community beautiful.\n    For six years, Morris did this work for free! \"We thought he deserved a paying job,\" says Scott Kessler, the association's executive director. Last January, Morris was recognized for his long-term contributions at an awards dinner. \"Morris was an obvious choice for the award,\" Kessler continues. \"He helps make our community the special place that it is.\"\n    Marc Nguyen, 10, who nominated  Morris as their Hometown Hero, agrees. \"I see him every day cleaning things up and helping other people,\" says Marc. \n    Morris modestly explains how many people help make the Normal Heights neighborhood special. \"I am not the only one,\" he says. But Morris is the only one responsible for his demanding work schedule. \"Everyone thinks I'm crazy,\" explains Morris. \"But to get the job done right, it's best to start in the early morning.\" Does that sound like a hero talking, or what?", "id": "high22090.txt"}
