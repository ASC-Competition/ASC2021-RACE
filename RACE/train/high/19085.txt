A lot of people say that Balinese culture is unique and that the people of Bali have always been content with the \"now\". If you ask a Balinese person what heaven is like, the probable answer will be \"just like Bali\". This only goes to show that most Balinese people are happy to be where they are and never worry.\nOne factor that contributes to this laidback lifestyle is the culture of close family ties in Bali. In the Balinese culture, support is always available. Balinese extended families are so tightly knit that all members usually reside in the same complex.\nBalinese culture is based on a form of this religion, which is called \"Hindu Darma\". This religion reached the island during the eleventh century. Most of the family customs and traditions as well as community lifestyles of the Balinese people are influenced by this.The religious influence even expands widely into the arts, which makes Bali distinct from the rest of Indonesia.\nIn spite of the fact that tourists flood to the island every year, Balinese people have managed to conserve their culture. Almost every native of Bali is an artist in some form or another. Parents and villagers have passed on their skills to their children, who all seem to have preference either for music, dance, or painting.\nAnother remarkable mark of the Balinese culture is the series of ceremonies and rituals known as the Manusa Yadnya. This marks the different stages of Balinese life. Cremation is very popular on this island--and unlike in the West, death is a joyous and color1ful event for the Balinese.", "id": "high19085.txt"}
