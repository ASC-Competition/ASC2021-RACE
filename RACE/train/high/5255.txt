Don't worry. Here is our handy guide to help you\nPower Down\nSo you stayed up too late last night reading Mockingjay for the fifth time. Oops! When you're that fired, your schoolwork suffers. Instead of studying inefficiently while you are sleepy, allow yourself a 15-minute afterschool power nap. Studies show that even a few minutes of shut-eye can improve memory and concentration.\nTake Notes\nNot quite grasping that super complicated concept in your chemistry class? You may need to change the way you take notes. Instead of recording every word your teacher says, try using visual hints like pictures, symbols and word bubbles. You can even switch computer fonts or pen color for the important stuff.\nDream On\nYour bed's not just for zzz's. Experts say it may be good to study in bed, too. Why? We're able to absorb more right before bed because we're less distracted and the new information stays in our minds as we sleep. So, slide into bed with a textbook or notes, read for 15 minutes, and then turn off the lights for some sweet and smart dreams.\nBrain Food\nYou're in the middle of a biology exam when your mind goes blank. You knew this stuff cold at home, but now you can't tell a ribosome from a chloroplast. What's going on? Your brain's in need of some refueling. Have some snacks like apple slices or cheese before class, and have plenty of water, too. If your teacher doesn't mind, pop in a piece of gum during an exam. Some scientists think the chewing increases the flow of oxygen to the brain.\nSmart Move\nUgh! You're taking an English test and you cannot remember the past participle of \"understand\". What to do? Skip it. Test taking is all about timing, so don't waste it on tricky questions. Move ahead and answer everything you know before returning to the ones you don't. Chances are, once you get back to the toughies, you'll recall the answer or at the very least, you'll have a little more time to come up with one that works.", "id": "high5255.txt"}
