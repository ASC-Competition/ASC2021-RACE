They're mostly in their early 20s, without jobs and not at university. They often wander the streets and are seen as a threat.\n    The Office for National Statistics reported on Dec, 11, 2006 that the number of young people who are not in school and not working or in training inprefix = st1 /Britainhas risen sharply since 1997.\n    Britainnow has 1.24 million people aged 15 to 24 who have nothing to do.

One in six people in this age group is _ .\n    These people are most likely to be from lower-income families and be supported by their families or the government. Those over 18 can get a weekly job seeker's allowance ofPS46 (690 yuan) from the government. This is only enough to cover the basic cost of living.\nHousing benefits are also available. But for single people under 25, these only cover rent for very cheap accommodation, such as a shared room.

Independent research suggests that some training programmes are a waste of time.\n    The New Deal, a major programme to help the unemployed young, is one example. In 1998, 61 per cent of those leaving the programme could find jobs. That number is now down to 35 per cent.\n    \"It shows a failure of government policy.
