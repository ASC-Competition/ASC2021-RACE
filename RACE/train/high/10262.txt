Instead,we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sun's light. This is a basic evolutionary fact, even though most of us don't think of ourselves as diurnal beings. Yet it's the only way to explain what we've done to the night: We've engineered it to  receive us by filling _ with light.\nThe benefits of this kind of engineering come with consequences  called light pollution  whose effects scientists are only now beginning to study. Light pollution is largely the result of bad  lighting design,which allows artificial light to shine outward and upward into the sky. III-designed lighting washes out the darkness of night and completely changes the light levels  and light  rhythms -- to which many forms of life, including, ourselves, have adapted. Wherever human light spills into the natural world, some aspect or life is affected .\nIn most cities the sky looks as though it has been emptied of stars, leaving behind a vacant haze  that mirrors our fear of the dark. We've grown so used to this orange haze that the original glory of an unlit nigh, - dark enough for the planet Venus to throw shadow on Earth, is wholly beyond our experience, beyond memory almost.\nWe've lit up the night as if it were an unoccupied country, when nothing could be further form the truth. Among mammals alone, the number of nocturnal species is astonishing, Light is a powerful biological force, and on many species it acts as a magnet . The effect is so powerful that scientists speak of songbirds and seabirds being \"captured\" by searchlights on land or by the light from gas flares on marine oil platforms. Migrating at night, birds tend to collide with brightly lit tall buildings.\nFrogs living near brightly lit highways suffer nocturnal light levels that are as much as a million times righter than normal, throwing nearly every aspect of their behavior out of joint including most other creatures ,we do need darkness .Darkness is as essential to our biological welfare, to our internal clockwork, as light itself.\nLiving in a glare of our making,we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage--the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night .In a very real sense light pollution causes us to lose sight of our true place in the universe, to forget the scale of our being, which is best measured against the dimensions of a deep night with the Milky Way--the edge of our galaxy arching overhead.", "id": "high10262.txt"}
