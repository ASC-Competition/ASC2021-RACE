Jane decided to have a late birthday party. She telephoned several friends. She asked some to bring records, some to bring food and others to bring something to drink. She rang another friend to see if she could borrow his record player. She herself bought some food and drink to get the party going. She took up all the carpets   so that they could dance. She did not know whether Barbara and Mary would have approved  , but as long as she was careful, she was sure that they would not mind. She warned the two people in the flat above and invited them down. \n\"Oh, \" said Jane, surprised. \"What's all this about? \"\nThe first guests arrived soon after eight. The music was soon playing loudly and they started dancing. Some of Jane's friends brought other friends with them. As more and more people arrived,the noise increased. People started shouting at each other, so they turned the music up. This made it more difficult to hear each other above the music, so they shouted more loudly. At half past ten the bell rang. \"Turn down the music!\" someone shouted. \"Someone probably called the police.\" When Jane opened the door, there was a policeman standing there. She started to apologize, \"I'm sorry about all the noise, officer. But you see, it was my birthday last week and I'm having a party.\" \"Never mind about that, miss. We're here because of something much more important.\"\n\"Well, there's been a report of burglary  . We think the thief may have come to your party, pretending to be a friend of someone here. \"", "id": "high5556.txt"}
