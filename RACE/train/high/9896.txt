For their lunch they both ordered soup. When it was brought, the nobleman took a spoonful, but the soup was so hot that he burned his mouth and tears came to his eyes. The merchant asked him why he was weeping. The nobleman was ashamed to admit that he had burned his mouth and answered, \"Sir, I once had a brother who committed a great crime, for which he was hanged. I was thinking of his death, and that made me weep.\" The merchant believed this story and began to eat his soup. He too burned his mouth, so that he had tears in his eyes. The nobleman noticed it and asked the merchant, \"Sir, why do you weep?\" The merchant, who now saw that the nobleman had deceived   him, answered, \"My lord(=\"master),\" I am weeping because you were not hanged together with your brother.\"", "id": "high9896.txt"}
