It was also said that she could be in line for a share of up to PS 30,000 reward money.\n Vicki Brown, 30, played a very important role in ending the nationwide manhunt. Vicki, who has worked at the Royal Hotel for four years, told of her terrible experience when she had to steal into Bieber's bedroom and to watch him secretly. Then she waited alone for the hours while armed police prepared to storm into the building.\nShe said: \"I was very nervous. But when I opened the hotel door and saw 20 armed policemen lined up in the car park I was so glad they were there.\"\nThe alarm had been raised because Vicki became suspicious  of the guest who checked in at 3 pm the day before New year's Eve with little luggage and wearing sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face. She said: \"He didn't seem to want to talk too much and make any eye contact .\" Vicki, the only employee on duty, called her bosses Margaret, 64, and husband Stall McKale, 65, who phoned the police at 11 pm.\nOfficers from Northumbria Police called Vicki at the hotel in Dunston, Gatesheed, at about 11:30 pm to make sure that this was the wanted man. Then they kept in touch by phoning Vicki every 15 minutes.\n\"It was about ten past two in the morning when the phone went again and a policeman said 'Would you go and make yourself known to the armed officers outside?' My heart missed a beat.\"\nVicki quietly showed eight armed officers through passages and staircases to the top floor room and handed over the key.\n\"I realized that my bedroom window overlooks that part of the hotel, so I went to watch. I could not see into the man's room, but I could see the passage. The police kept shouting at the man to come out with his hands showing. Then suddenly he must have come out because they shouted for him to lie down while he was handcuffed .", "id": "high17284.txt"}
