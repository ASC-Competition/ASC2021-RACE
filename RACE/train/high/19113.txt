However, actually using a cell phone while driving can be life-threatening.\nStudies have shown that new drivers are especially prone   to have an accident when they use a cell phone while driving. The reason for this is that new drivers have less experience in concentrating on driving during distractions  . Also, several studies done on teen drivers found that many teens often send text messages while driving. Since text messaging involves both the hands and the eyes, this is thought to be more distracting and dangerous than when drivers use a cell phone only for speaking and listening while driving.\nAll drivers who use a cell phone while driving are reported to be at least four times more likely to have an accident than drivers who don't use a cell phone while driving. Such studies have inspired many countries, including the United States, to have at least some bans on hand-held cell phone use while driving. However, many people feel that these restrictions are far from enough.\nHand-free cell phones were still found in many studies to distract the drivers' attention even though the drivers had both hands on the wheel  . In some studies, drivers themselves admitted that they sometimes become distracted when they use any type of the cell phones while driving.\nSome studies have shown that using a cell phone while driving is actually just as dangerous as driving drunk! Both cases can impair   the drivers' concentration as well as their reaction time to other vehicles or problems on the road. If a cell phone is used in crawling   traffic such as a traffic jam, it is not as likely to cause danger as when a driver uses a cell phone at even moderate speeds on twisting and turning roads.", "id": "high19113.txt"}
