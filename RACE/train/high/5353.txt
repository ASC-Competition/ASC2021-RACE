The benefits in terms of sudden cardiac death reduction are there for all women, not just those with established heart disease.\"\n\"It can be difficult to quit. It needs to be a long-term goal. It's not always easily achievable and it may take more than one attempt.\"\nEllen Mason, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: \"This study shows that smoking just a couple of cigarettes a day could still seriously affect your future health.\"\n\"As we approach the new year, many of us will be making resolutions and giving up smoking will be the top of the list for lots of people.\"\n\"If you're thinking of quitting and need a _ , this research adds to the wealth of evidence that stopping smoking is the single best thing you can do for your heart health.\"\nA recent study in The Lancet of 1.2million Women found those who gave up smoking by the age of 30 would almost completely avoid the risk of dying early from tobacco-related diseases.\nLatest figures suggest a fifth of women in England smoke.", "id": "high5353.txt"}
