According to the World Federation for Mental Health and the WHO, depression has moved beyond the medical domain  to become a social problem. Statistics from the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center show that of the 287,000 people who commit suicide in China every year, 70 percent are victims of depression.\n\"This equates to one depression victim taking their life every three minutes,\" cited CCTV recently. According to the Beijing-based Capital Medical University, the number of depression patients has been on the rise in the past years and now accounts for 5 to 10 percent of the population, more than the global average of 5 percent.\nWang Shaoli, vice-president of Beijing Huilongguan Hospital, a medical center specializing in mental health, said that what makes depression so widespread is that everybody can get it.\n\"No one is immune to depression,\" said Wang. \"It has become a social problem because depression kills one's social capabilities, such as communication, and leads to a negative social mentality.\"\nAccording to Wang, depression can be treated with medicine and early psychological consultation. The real problem is the lack of awareness surrounding the issue.\n\"People with mental health illnesses are discriminated against,\" said Wang. \"So they are reluctant to go to hospital and often keep the pain to themselves, which only makes matters worse.\" Only one in 10 depression victims are properly treated in China, according to the Beijing Suicide Research and Prevention Center.\n\"When people get depressed, it becomes part of their thoughts, making them negative, even desperate,\" said Wang. \"And the ideas are difficult to change.\" That's why Wang suggests early intervention.\n\"Normally it takes about nine months to treat depression,\" said Wang. \"But in most cases, patients drop treatment half way when they feel some progress.\"", "id": "high2714.txt"}
