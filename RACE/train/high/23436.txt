It is now becoming increasingly difficult to buy anything that is not done up in beautiful wrapping.\nThe package itself is of no interest to the shopper, who usually throws it away immediately. Useless wrapping accounts for much of the refuse put out by the average London house-hold each week  So why is it done? Some of it, like the cellophane on meat, is necessary, but most of the rest is simply competitive selling.  This is absurd.Packaging is using up valuable energy and resources and polluting the environment.\nRecycling is already happening with milk bottles which are returned to the dairies , washed out, and refilled. But both glass and paper are being threatened by the growing use of plastic. More dairies are experimenting with plastic bottles.\nThe trouble with plastic is that it does not rot  Some environmentalists argue that the only solution to the problem of ever increasing plastic containers is to throw away plastic altogether in the shops, a suggestion unacceptable to many producers who say there is no alternative   to their handy plastic packs.\nIt is evident that more research is needed into the recovery and re-use of various materials  and into the cost of collecting and recycling containers rather than producing new ones.  Unnecessary packaging, intended to be used just once, and make things look better so more people will buy them, is clearly becoming increasingly absurd  But it is.not so much a question of throwing away packaging as using it wisely.What is needed now is a more advanced approach  to using scarce resources for what is, after all,  a  ly unimportant function.", "id": "high23436.txt"}
