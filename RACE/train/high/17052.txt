Brad's little sister thought it was really funny. So let's find more riddles for the next time I go over there. And maybe you can come along with me sometime.\"\n\"Really ?\" T.J's eyes light up . \"OK!\" T.J runs upstairs, and then comes back, smiling and carrying Just Joking.", "id": "high17052.txt"}
