By the end of October, she was just one lateness away from the six allowed a student for the entire term.\nMs. Layne and N-Dia, 9, live at the Regent Family Residence for the Homeless. They moved here last summer from their original family shelter in Brownsville, Brooklyin.\nOn a recent schoolday, N-Dia waited on the subway station at East 103rdStreet. N-Dia and her mother boarded the No. 1 train, and then changed to the No. 3 at 96thStreet.\nAfter 96thStreet, N-Dia napped on her mother's shoulder when Ms. Layne was listening to music. N-Dia often does her homework on the ride home. A few stops before Sutter Avenue, where N-Dia's school is, Ms. Layne woke her up. Then she hurried her daughter to school before the first bell.\n\"It's unfair, and it makes me feel upset,\" N-Dia said. \n\"I don't want her to grow up and have to go through what I went through,\" said Ms. Layne, who transferred  to different schools many times. \"It affected my grade greatly.\"\nIn N-Dia's case, the efforts to keep her at her charter school, which received a C on its last city progress report, failed. It was agreed that N-Dia should attend school closer to the shelter. \" I cried during the meeting,\" Ms. Layne said. \"I really wanted to keep her in that school where she had some type of stability.\"", "id": "high23539.txt"}
