I was not as rich as before! We moved to the small apartment, and there was only one shower in the bathroom.It was so cold to take a shower in such a cold winter.But I found that if one person took the shower first, the room could get a little warmer.So every day I rushed to the bathroom first.I was thinking that, when she took the shower, the room would get warmer, even if it was only 1degC.\nNow I cannot give her a comfortable life, take her to good restaurants, or buy expensive dresses for her, but at least, I can give her 1degC love.", "id": "high18671.txt"}
