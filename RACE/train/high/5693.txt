One in four working parents worry that half an hour simply isn't enough, while almost half fret that they aren't a good enough parent during the week.\nHowever, parenting experts believe just 12 minutes a day may be enough for mothers and fathers to fully _ with their child -- as long as they ask the right questions. Child psychologist Dr Claire Halsey said asking a series of open-ended questions can help improve parents' relationship with their children.\nAmong the questions recommended in the research are: \"How many times have you smiled today -- what made you laugh?\"; \"Can you act out what you did at breaktime?\"; \"Who is taller -- mummy or your teacher?\" and \"What are the names of the toys you played with today?\" Parents of older children are advised to start up a conversation with: \"I've got a great story for you but I want one in return... you first!\" or \"Tell me some school gossip ... _ !\"\nDr Halsey, working with the makers of Ribena Plus, who commissioned the research, said: \"There is no one as tough on their own parenting skills as a parent -- but this study shows there is no need for parents to be so harsh. It's hard for working parents to juggle all their responsibilities and it can feel like guilt is simply a parent's lot -- but it's absolutely not. By using clever tactics such as a little preparation alongside use of open-ended questions -- such as 'Tell me what the best bit about your day was?' -- parents can reduce the time worrying about chores and work and spend more time learning about their children's day.\"", "id": "high5693.txt"}
