It won't make up for weak answers, but it can communicate some positive things about your personality and what you might be like to work with. \n* Blue: You can't go wrong with darker shades of blue, especially navy. Choosing from this powerful color1 will project an image of someone who is in control. From the interviewer's point of view, the color1 blue suggests calm, stability, trust, truth, confidence and security. These are all great messages to send without saying a word. \n* Gray: After blue, gray is the second most popular color to wear for an interview. Like darker blue, it's not a distracting color1 to the interviewer, which means they'll be focused more on what you're saying and how you're saying it. Gray means sophistication  , so use it to your advantage. \n* Black: This is a commanding color1 and represents authority. Black also suggests excitement, so use it carefully when putting together your interview outfit. You may want to use it as an accent   --like in a scarf or tie, for instance--rather than as the primary color. \n* Red: This is an extremely powerful color1. It's so strong that you should only use it as an accent color1. Reds are associated with energy, passion, desire, power and aggression. People think of intensity   and passion when they see the color1 red, so use it carefully or it could send the wrong message to the interviewer. \n* White: White shirts and blouses are always appropriate. It sends the message of simplicity, cleanliness, precision and goodness.", "id": "high17746.txt"}
