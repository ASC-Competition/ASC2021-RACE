But when the lrish call, it gets complex and difficult.\" ks5u\nAs I wrote recently, those speaking English as a second language frequently say they find it easier to talk to each other than to someone from the US, the UK ,Canada ,Ireland or Australia.\nAnyone wanting to get to the top of international business, medicine or academia(but possibly not sport)needs to be able to speak English to a pretty high level .Equally, any native English speaker wanting to deal with these new high achievers needs to know how to talk without confusing them.\nBecause so many English-speakers today are monoglots ,they have little idea how difficult it is to master another language. Many think the best way to make foreigners understand is to be chatty and informal. This may seem friendly but,as it probably involves using informal expressions, it makes comprehension harder.\nSpeaking slowly helps, but avoiding figurative or idiomatic expressions is more important. Phrasal verbs are another trouble for non-native English speakers; imagine trying to understand the difference between\" I couldn't put up with him\"and \" I agreed to put him up\".It's better to say \"I couldn't tolerate him\"and \" I agreed to let him stay for night \". The words may be longer but the meaning is easier to understand.\nThe greatest friend to anyone trying to understand another language is repetition; not saying the same thing over and over again,but saying it in different ways.", "id": "high22426.txt"}
