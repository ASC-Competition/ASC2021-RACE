To unlock the full potential of your brain, you need to keep it active and acute. But how? Check out these tips:\n* Exercise & get your body moving \nExercising doesn't just exercise the body; it also helps to exercise your brain. Without regular exercise your blood vessels   begin to lose the ability to effectively pump blood and it also reduces the amount of oxygen and nutrients   that your blood carries to your brain. When the nutrients don't make it there, the brain's ability to function is compromised. To prevent this from happening, make sure you get moving every day. Walking, swimming and dancing are all excellent activities. \n* Get rid of stressors and seek help for depression\nAmong the most brain-damaging stressors is severe depression, which is actually often mistaken for a memory problem since one of its primary symptoms is the inability to concentrate. If you can't concentrate, you might feel like you are constantly forgetting things. Depression increases the levels of cortisol   in your brain, which affects your memory. Seek professional help to get rid of your depression -- your brain will thank you.\n* Feed your brain \n50 to 60 percent of the brain's overall weight is pure fat, which is used to insulate   its billions of nerve cells. The better insulated a cell is, the quicker you will be thinking. This is exactly why parents are advised to feed their young children whole milk. Thus, eating foods that contain a healthy mix of fats is vital for long-term memory. Some excellent food choices include fish and dark leafy green vegetables.", "id": "high23232.txt"}
