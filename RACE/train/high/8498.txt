With the help of social media, rumors -- no matter whether they are true or false -- spread like wildfire, and sometimes we can't be sure what to believe.\nNow, an international group of researchers might be able to make it easier for us. They are working on a lie detector that could separate online truth from lies, Discovery news reported.\nNamed after the Greek goddess Pheme, famed for spreading bad rumors, the system is far from a traditional lie detector, which works by attaching a machine to a potential liar. Instead, Pheme analyzes the rumor directly.\nWhen a rumor comes out, on a micro blog, for example, Pheme can trace the source of information to see if it was released by reliable sources like experts or news agencies. If it wasn't, Pheme then examines the history and background of the account to identify whether it was created just to spread rumors -- whether it's what's called an \"Internet bot.\"\nAfter finding the source of the rumor, the system can keep a close eye on how other users react to the rumor -- either confirming or denying it -- to help analyze and further determine the reliability of the information.\nSome people might find the Pheme system unnecessary based on the idea that false rumors never survive for long and people always get to the truth over time. While that's a fair point, there is a certain class of rumors, such as \"a tiger is at large\" or \"an asteroid   is about to hit the Earth\", that can cause panic among people and thus lead to serious consequences.\nThese are cases when we need to be able to check for accuracy quickly. \"Our system aims to help with that, by tracking and verifying information in real time,\" lead researcher Kalina Bontcheva, at the University of Sheffield, UK, told the BBC.\nAccording to Bontcheva, Pheme is still under development and won't be ready for another 18 months.[:. . ]\nUntil then, there's an old fashioned technique that you can use to protect yourself from false information -- ask questions, check sources and don't believe any claim until you've seen the evidence for it.", "id": "high8498.txt"}
