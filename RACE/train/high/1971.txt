The idea started in the mind of a man, Jerry Miller in Ohio. He wondered how farmers could meet new people who understand the life of a farmer. Jerry Miller is not a farmer but he represents a lot of farmers.\nAs he tells it, the idea for the site was planted when a farmer told him one day that she was recently divorced and would like to date. _ \nSo, in 2005, Jerry Miller launched his website. \"You don't have to be a farmer to be onFarmersOnly.com, but you do have to have the good old-fashioned traditional values of America's Heartland.\"\nYou also have to live in the United States or Canada to be a member of the site. Some services are free, but a full membership costs fifty dollars for a year. As of last week the site listed more than 58,000 members. Many of them are farmers in the United States. Others are students or workers involved in some way with agriculture. Jerry Miller tells us about thirty marriages in the last year have resulted from his website.\nSome farmers have also found love through a group,Singles in Agriculture, which was formed as a nonprofit organization in 1986. It organizes gatherings that usually end with a dance, but is not a dating service. The purpose is to support educational and social activities that offer people a chance for friendship. Its website,singlesinag.org, says there are more than 1,000 members across the nation and as far away as France.", "id": "high1971.txt"}
