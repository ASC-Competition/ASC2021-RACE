There the land of the Navajo Reservation looks very much like the lunar surface. Among all the trucks and large vehicles were two large figures that were dressed in full lunar space suits.\nNearby, a Navajo shepherd   and his son were watching the strange creatures walk about, occasionally being watched over by other NASA workers. The two Navajo people were noticed and approached by the NASA people. Since the shepherd and his son did not know English, they asked the NASA people who the strange creatures were. The NASA people told them that they were just men that were getting ready to go to the moon. The shepherd became very excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts.\nThe NASA officials thought this was a great idea so they provided a tape recorder. After the man gave them his message, they asked his son to translate. His son would not.\nLater, they tried a few more people on the Navajo Reservation to translate and every person they asked would chuckle   and then refuse to translate. Finally, with cash in hand someone translated the message, \"Watch out for these guys, they have come to take your land!\"", "id": "high22395.txt"}
