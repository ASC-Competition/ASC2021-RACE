But after a year of preparing herself , Laura has been allowed to sail.\n\"I was so happy I almost jump into the water,\" Laura said , after learning of the court's judgement. She was born on a yacht  in the South Pacific ,and now lives with her father in a boat. When Dutch child protection groups first heard about her plan to sail alone , they stopped her from doing so .\nSince the decision, though, Laura had been preparing with her father to persuade the courts that she was ready. Last week she received the books and other materials she would need for school while she was at sea. She added safety equipment to a new, big ship. And she took her first aid course to learn several survival skills, like how to put out fires on the boat, take care of her own injuries and deal with lack of sleep. She also planned a safer course --- adding alternate routes  to avoid pirate  attacks, and planning a course that would have her on dry land as she moved from port to port across the world.\nLaura is using a larger and more safer boat. If she finished successfully in less than two years, she will take the title from current record-holder Jessica Watson, of Australia, who was 16 when she completed the journey.", "id": "high8410.txt"}
