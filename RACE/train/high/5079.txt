My name is Lisa, and I am a lioness. I live on the open grasslands of Africa with my family. Lions living in a group are called a pride.\nMy father is strong and powerful. He and his cousin are the leaders of our pride. The other members are my mother, her sisters, and their children.\nThe area where a pride lives is big! We roar   to tell each other where we are and to warn strangers to stay away.\nMeet my new baby brother. His name is Leon. See the spots on his fur? We lions are born spotted or striped  . As we grow older, the spots gradually disappear.\nLionesses usually spend their entire lives with their birth pride, but Leon will leave when he is about three years old. He'll run around with a male   friend or relative for a few years until they take over a pride of their own.\nBut for now, we have lots of fun together. We often play and fight for hours, which can help us practice skills that we will need for hunting. )\nWe lions keep ourselves very clean. Just like a house cat, I clean my fur (with my tongue. We clean for each other, too, to show we're friends.\nLions like to sleep for most of the day. We hunt in the cool evening. Female   lions hunt more often than male lions. We work together as a team. At the right moment, we attack and kill our prey. Then we share it. Male lions usually eat first. Females eat next. Baby lions are the last to eat. The smallest one gets the least food.\nSince we are full, it's time to go to find a nice place for a sleep. Bye!", "id": "high5079.txt"}
