Over the last 25 years an increasing number of dedicated cycle tracks and parks have sprung up in both town and country, many developed by bike clubs and other community groups.\n    Recreational cycling was already on a roll, when in 2009 a 50 million New Zealand dollar government fund was established to create a continuous touring route running the length of the country, supported al a grass roots level by an additional 50 million New Zealand dollars offered up by councils and focal organizations.\n    It soon became apparent, however, that building one continuous route across the two islands was not only too ambitious, hut it also would bypass many of the most remote and interesting corners of the country. Restoring and extending historic pathways made more sense, enabling cyclists to visit fascinating historic and cultural sites while seeing natural wonders along the way, and inspiring both locals and people from overseas to ride them.\n    The first sod   of the new trails was turned by Prime Minister John Key in late 2(X)9. Since then, armed will machetes, shovels and diggers, some of the world's hest single-track designers and builders have bush-bashed, benched. sidled and switch-hacked their way through a diverse range of terrain  .\n    By the encl of 2012, 10 0f the 20 trails were open to riders, with the remainder scheduled for completion by the end of 2,013.The 2,340 km network will be even further extended by already-established trails, such as the famous 71 km Queen Charlotte Track that goes through the Marlborough Sounds al the top of the South Island.", "id": "high17421.txt"}
