It is tiny and has only nine islands with a population of just 11,000. In 1999, it was the third- poorest country in the world. The islanders earned just $1,000 each year.\nBut then something unusual happened. Tuvalu received an internet domain   name--the letters \"tv\". These letters were very interesting for many companies around the world. A communication company from California offered to buy the domain name \"tv\" for $40 m. For the Tuvalans this was a very large amount of money. The islanders became very rich.\nBecause of global warming, and because the islands are only 3m above sea level, Tuvalu will probably become the first country in the world that will disappear under the sea.\nYou can already see signs of the rising sea on Tuvalu. Some beaches are disappearing and you can see tree roots by the ocean. Cyclones used to be very rare but they now appear a few times a year, and the rains that come with the cyclones cause flooding. Despite these problems, the Tuvalans had their new money. They could use it to buy themselves a future. Or at least they could use it to buy some time. Paul Lindsay, a documentary film-maker, took these questions with him all the way to Tuvalu, and came back with an incredible  story. As the water rises, the Tuvalans are using the money to develop the land. They are building new houses, planning nightclubs, restaurants and hotels and new cars are driving around on new roads. The residents do not think this is strange: \"Just because we are sinking, it doesn't mean we don't want to raise our standards of living.\" Sam Teo, Tuvalu's minister for natural resources told Lindsay.", "id": "high8525.txt"}
