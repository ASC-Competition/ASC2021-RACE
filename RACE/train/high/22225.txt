I had a quarrel with the airport staff  and then was asked to have a drug test .I missed the flight home later because of bad weather. Now my flight home was full and running late. I felt sorry and unlucky.\nAt that moment,I noticed a 5-year-old boy standing by his mother watching me. He left his mother and slowly walked towards me.\"Great!\"I thought sadly,\"Now I have to take care of a 5-year-old child. My day is now complete.\"\nAs he came closer,I found it was my hat that he was after. I wanted to tell him not to touch my things,but I was curious to know what he would do with my hat. With wide eyes,he gently touched my hat. He looked up at me,smiling,but saying nothing. I asked him if he wanted to wear my hat,he excitedly nodded,still smiling. I placed my hat on his head,but it fell down around his ears. He didn't mind and held it up with both hands. He ran to show his mother,then back to me,still smiling. With much respect,he slowly took off my hat with both hands and gave it to me.\nI put my hat on and gave him an airplane card. Holding the card carefully with both hands,he looked up at me and said,\"Mister,you sure are lucky.\"\"Yes,I sure am,\"I said. I admired the wisdom of a 5-year-old boy,as I got the last seat on that flight home.", "id": "high22225.txt"}
