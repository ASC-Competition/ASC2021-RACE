It is still the book that I turn to when I have physical unrest that requires deeper understanding. Louise Hay is the pioneer in looking at the connection between the physical unrest that we have in our body and the emotional connection. At the time that she wrote the book many people scoffed at this idea, but it is now widely accepted and millions of people refer to it on a daily basis.\n2)\n, Don Miguel Ruiz: Maintaining a sense of reliability and faith is developed through understanding to The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz written in 1997. We are faced with rules and regulations; don't do this, don't do that, watch what you are doing, be kind, loyal, faithful etc. The four agreements represent a simple system of maintaining your own inner authority while practicing being a true person with other people.\n3)\n, Richard Carlson and Joseph Bailey: This is a new one in my \"bedside collection\" and one that has made the biggest impact on me lately. Written in 1997, it is even more relevant today than it was when it was written. The idea of \"slowing down\" to get there faster was extremely hard for me to understand. As a human species we seem to enjoy moving fast and expecting quick results, especially from ourselves. I should be successful now, I should be slim now, get me to my destination now--in contrast to \"in the fullness of time\" when I am ready.\n4)\n, Florence Scovel-Shinn: A classic book that was first published in 1925 and remains one of my favorite books of all time. Scovel-Shinn understood the power of our words to express either our deepest desires or our most horrible nightmares.\nSo where does this leave you? The way I see it is if you want to 'Heal Your Life\" then you had better learn how to play \"The Game of Life\" by learning how to \"Slow Down to the Speed of Life\" and keep the \"Four Agreements\". The solution may not be easy to do but it is simple. In fact, most solutions are pretty simple, and it is us humans that want to complicate it.", "id": "high15765.txt"}
