But one conclusion seems to have escaped most reports in the aerospace media.The flight of Shenzhou 7 could be timed to coincide with the Beijing Olympics. Plans for 2008 Summer Olympics call for the events to be held between the 8th and 24th of August in that year. It's reasonable to expect that China will use the event to display its achievements before the world, and human spaceflight is China's most significant recent breakthrough.\nShenzhou 7, China's next manned space mission, was originally advertised for 2007.This fit the pattern of staging a two-gap between crewed Shenzhou missions, which have previously launched in 2003 and 2005.But Chinese media statements have amended this to 2008.Chinese media have reported that the whole program is going well, more time is needed to work on spacesuit that will be used on this flight to stage China's first spacewalk. It's possible that Chinese engineers want to make best preparations for this complex mission.\nChina could intend to carry out the mission of Shenzhou 7 just as media attention is focused on the lead--up to the Olympics. The crew of the fight, and possibly China's other flown astronauts, could then take part in the opening ceremony. China has previously honnoured her space travelers in great celebrations, such as the Hong Kong event that saw Yang Liwei singing with Jacky Chan.", "id": "high23617.txt"}
