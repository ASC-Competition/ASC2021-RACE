What are the possible signs to be aware of? And how is it possible to stop the need of spending?\n\"Some of the new evidence suggests that some people, maybe 10%-15%, may have a genetic preference to an addictive behavior, coupled with an environment in which the particular behavior is caused, but no one really knows why.\" However, it is much better understood as to why \"shopaholics\" continue with their unhealthy and destructive behaviors.
