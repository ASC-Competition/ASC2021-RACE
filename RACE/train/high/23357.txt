She said Shaun Jones,14,died \"as a result of complications of medical treatment\". \nShaun,who was described by his mother as \"vain\" about his appearance,saw Dr Jones,his family doctor,about spors on his back and shoulders after learning his friends had been given medication to deal with similar problems. \nThe boy,who had previously used Clearasil to treat the spots,was diagnosed with mild acne and given a prescription. But when he went to his local chemist's with his mother,he was told the drug was not available. They said they had contacted Dr Jones(in fact they didn't),and  Shaun could be given different pills which were the same as the drug originally prescribed. Mrs. Jones noriced there was no safety instructions included in the box,but thought nothing of it at the time. \nShaun took the drug just before going to bed at 10:30 pm. Little more than an hourlater, he complained of shortness of breath and tighmess in his chest. Mrs. . Jones initially contacted an out--of--hours GP service but was told no doctor was available. When Shaun's condition  became worse,he was rushed to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital by ambulance in the early hours of the next morning. \nDespite treatment there,and at the University Hospital of Wales,Cardiff,where he was transferred,Shaun died at 10:40 am the following day. Doctors at the hospital believe an unusual reaction to the acne drug could have caused his death. \nHassel said she would write a report to the Lord Chancellor's office imdedining the impor-tailce that \"doctors prescribe drugs and doctors make adjustments and patients receive drugs with the correct information attached\".", "id": "high23357.txt"}
