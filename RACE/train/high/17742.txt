The only problem was, I didn't have any luggage to pack my belongings in.\nMy friend Debbie offered to lend me a suitcase that belonged to her father, who had passed away long ago. \"I don't know if you'll want to use it,\" she said so gently, \"it's very old, worn out, and such an ugly yellow color1.\" I was so touched by her offer to lend something that belonged to her father, but I was also concerned about the possibility of it being damaged or lost. She insisted that I take it. So with the suitcase safely in hand, I boarded the train with Kathy.\nWe spent two days and one night on the train, sleeping in our seats. As we slept, we were awakened at times, by the noises of the train pulling in and out of the stations.\nThe next morning we eagerly awaited the announcement: Next stop, Colorado Springs. But suddenly, there came another announcement over the loud speaker. \"During one of the overnight stops, many pieces of luggage were mistakenly removed from the train and left at the wrong location.\"\nKathy and I just looked at each other, as I felt the disappointment swell. Could my worst fear be coming true, was Debbie's suitcase lost?\nJust then two train conductors passed our seats. One of them jokingly said to the other, \"Did you ever see such an old, ugly, brighter yellow, piece of luggage in all of your life?\"\nBefore the other conductor could answer, I screamed, \"YES, MY SUITCASE MADE IT!\"\n The two conductors stopped in their tracks! and, very red in the face, couldn't seem to apologize enough for having insulted my suitcase.\n When I returned it, I couldn't wait to get the suitcase back into Debbie's safe hands. She asked, \"Did everything go well on the trip?\" Somehow, I just couldn't resist telling her what had happened. She laughed heartily. \nWhen I recall the golden suitcase, I'm reminded, that like the suitcase, we can see ourselves as too old, useless, worn out, and of little value. Or, we can take a closer look and realize that we are one of God's most valued creations -- unique, and holding inside our most valuable possessions -- that of love, faith, hope, and wisdom.", "id": "high17742.txt"}
