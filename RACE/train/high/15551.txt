Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself? Well, apparently it's because we have mirror neurons  in our brains.\nPut simply, the existence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something, our brains imitate  it,whether or not we actually perform the same action. This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile, talk, walk, dance or play sports. But the idea goes further: mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions\nthey also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people.\nMirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains, but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages, and to understand how other people feel. Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language. A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to (for example: \"The hand took hold of the ball\"), the same mirror neurons were\nas when the action was actually performed (in this example, actually taking hold of a ball).\nAny problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior. Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning. However, it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders.\nResearch into mirror neurons seems to provide us with ever more information concerning how humans behave and interact .Indeed, it may turn out to be the equivalent  for neuroscience of what Einstein's theory of relativity was for physics. And the next time you feel the urge to cough in the cinema when someone else does---well, perhaps you'll understand why.", "id": "high15551.txt"}
