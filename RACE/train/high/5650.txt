Being a message therapist  is a perfect job for many people with a visual disability, but for Zheng Jianwei, it was far from enough.\nThe 30-year-old former massage therapist gave up his hospital job in 2009to prepare for admission to graduate school.

He was the first blind examinee to take the IELTS in the Southeast Chinese region. After about four year's struggles, Zheng successfully gain an offer from the University of Essex in the United Kingdom and became a graduate student.\nHowever,Zheng's path to graduate school was not easy. \"I can't take China's national entrance exam for graduate school, which doesn't provide study material for blind students,\" he says.\nHe then turned to search for graduate school overseas.

Because of the lack of study material, Zheng needs to spend hours and days looking for textbooks for the visually disabled and copying them, while it may take only five minutes for a sighted person to order a plain English textbook from Amazon.\nIn his parents' eyes, Zheng has been a sensible, independent and decisive man from a young age. Zheng made all the major decisions by himself, including studying abroad and choosing majors. \"We just follow his decisions, \" the mother says.", "id": "high5650.txt"}
