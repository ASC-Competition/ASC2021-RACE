An F.D.A. official called them \"as safe to eat as the food we eat every day.\" And when those clones reproduce sexually , the agency says, their offspring  are safe to eat as well. But research on cloned sheep is limited. So the F.D.A. proposes that sheep clones not be used for human food.\nThe United States this year could become the first country to approve the sale of foods from cloned animals. First, however, the public will have ninety days to comment on three proposed documents. On December 28th the F.D.A. released a long report, called a draft risk assessment, along with two policy documents.\nThe agency says it must receive comments by April second. The F.D.A. seemed ready to act several years ago, but an advisory committee called for more research.\nFor now, the government will continue to ask producers to honor a request that they not sell foods from cloned animals.\nClones are still rare. They cost a lot and are difficult to produce.\nThe F.D.A. says most food from cloning is expected to come not from clones themselves, but from their sexually reproduced offspring. It says clones are expected to be used mostly as breeding animals to spread good qualities.\nPublic opinion studies show most Americans do not like the idea of food from cloned animals. But this research also shows the public knows little about cloning.\nCloning differs from genetic engineering. A cell taken from a so-called donor animals is grown into an embryo in the laboratory. Next, the embryo is placed into the uterus of a female animal. If the process is successful, the pregnancy reaches full term and a genetic copy of the donor animal is born.", "id": "high7511.txt"}
