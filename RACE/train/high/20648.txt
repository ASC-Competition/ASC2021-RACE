In other words, Westerners tend to put most of their ideas and feelings into words, and then state these ideas and feelings clearly and openly. It is generally considered a good thing to \"get to the point \"and \"say what you mean,\" and it is largely the speaker's responsibility to ensure that his/her message is stated in a way that is clear and easy to understand.\nIn contrast , Chinese people tend to communicate in a way that is more indirect and subtle. They often view direct, explicit communication as unsophisticated or even rude. They are more likely to preserve good feelings and relationships by not saying something that might upset or offend  another person. If a Westerner makes a request and a Chinese person responds by saying something like \"I'll think it over\", the Westerner may assume that there is a good chance that the answer will be \"yes\". In fact, there is a better chance that the implied answer is \"no\".\nOne interesting example of the Western preference for very direct communication can be seen in what Western students are taught about how they should organize their writing. Writers are generally expected to state their point as clearly as possible, generally right at the beginning. Students are taught to begin paragraphs with a \"topic sentence\" that states the point of the paragraph. Also, articles should generally begin with a brief statement of the points to be made -and also conclude with a review of those same points. In contrast, in Chinese writing it is more acceptable to build up to the point rather announcing it right form the start, although it is also acceptable to state the point up front.\nIt is important to note that Westerners are not all equally direct in their communication styles. For example, the direct communication style is more typical of Western men than of Western women. Furthermore, even in Western culture it is generally not considered good to communicate so directly that you hurt other people's feelings, offend them, or create conflict.", "id": "high20648.txt"}
