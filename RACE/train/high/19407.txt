There are many reasons why people prefer one type of pet over the other. So, have you ever wondered what your preference for cats or dogs says about you?\nIn fact, a 2010 study done by Sam Gosling, a psychologist at the University of Texas, US, and his graduate student Carson Sandy found that dog people are more extroverted  , agreeable and conscientious   than cat people.\n\"Cats will occasionally engage in social activities, but usually after only a few minutes they will give up the game. Dogs, on the other hand, will often engage in play, like fetching a thrown ball, for hours at a time,\" said Modern Dog magazine.\nJust on the basis of dogs' nature being more sociable than cats', you may expect that the personalities of dog people also reflect higher sociability.
