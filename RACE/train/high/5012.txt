The name is new,but the idea is old. Young people and their parents don't understand each other. The world has always kept changing. During the second century after Christ a wise man said, \"Bury me on my face because in a little while everything will be turned upside down.\"  There has always been a gap between generations, but more people talk about it now. Old Mr. Ellis thinks he understands what has happened. \"When I was a boy, I thought the world was a beautiful place. My life was very pleasant. But when I was older, I learned about people who were treated badly, people who didn't have enough to eat. I wanted to help them, and I married a girl who wanted to help them, too.
