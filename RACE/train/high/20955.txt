Like their pioneer ancestors, they can build it themselves, and at less than half the cost of a ready-made house.\"\n The owner-builders came from every occupational group, although surprisingly few are professional building workers. Many  _ with little or no experience. \"I learned how to build my house from reading books,\" says John Brown, who built a six-room home for $25, 000 in High Falls, New Jersey. \"If you have patience and the carpentry skill to make a bookcase, you can build a house.\" An astonishing 50 percent of these owner-builders hammer every nail, lay every pipe, and wire every switch with their own hands. The rest contract for some parts of the task. But even those who just act as contractors and finish the insides of their homes can save from 30 percent to 45 percent of what a ready-made home would cost.\nOne survey revealed that 60 percent of owner-builders also design their homes. Many others buy commercial house plans for less than $100 or use plans available from the U. S. Department of Agriculture.", "id": "high20955.txt"}
