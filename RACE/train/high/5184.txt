Each year around 12.7 million people discover they have cancer and 7.6 million people die from some form of the disease. There are about 200 known types of cancer.\nRachel Thompson, the WCRF's head of science, said that while the message was simple -- that not smoking, eating good food and being a healthy weight can help _ many cancers -- it was still a difficult one to get across.\nThe WHO says adults should do at least 150 minutes of exercise a week. This could be done by walking for 30 minutes five times per week or by cycling to work every day.\nPeter Baldini, head of the World Lung Foundation, also called on all governments to introduce smoke-free laws and raise the price of cigarettes. Tobacco kills millions of smokers every year, and tobacco-related lung cancers also kill hundreds of thousands of people who don't smoke but have been exposed to it second-hand.\n\"There isn't a magic bullet to cure all forms of cancer, but we have the opportunity and the duty to protect people from developing cancer wherever possible,\" Baldini said.", "id": "high5184.txt"}
