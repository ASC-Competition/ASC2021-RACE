Edeka has tried the system at 70 of its supermarkets. It says it will introduce it at 200 others because customers like it.\n\"At first we thought that only the young who really keep up with the latest technology would be interested, but we were wrong,\" said Stefan Sewoester from IT Werke. \"Almost two-thirds of the people who use the system are 40 and older,\" he said.\nIT Werke, a computer company, is one of the pioneers of fingerprint payment software in Germany. It has helped about 150 shops, canteens and bars to put in the fingerprint scanning machines. Each costs about 2,000 euros.\nTo sign up for the service, customers must have their fingerprints taken and leave their addresses and banking details with the shop. The shop then takes the cost of goods directly out of the customer's bank account.\n\"It is especially a good thing for elderly people. Now they do not have to remember their pin to pay with their bank cards, or to scratch around for their glasses or cash.\" Sewoester said.\nThe stores benefit from the system too. It saves more than time in the check-out line. It also cuts out the hidden costs of accepting electronic card payments.", "id": "high764.txt"}
