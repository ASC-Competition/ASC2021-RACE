I don't think the translation is an accurate one, since it doesn't only belong to lovers. Valentine's Day is for expressing affection of all sorts. But it is uniquely for the romantically involved who shine the brightest, who spend the most money, whose hearts are the most engaged.\nWhen I was b boy, my mother would buy enough cheap cards with ugly drawings of butterflies and little rabbits and honeybees for me to give one to every kid in my class, about 20 or so. The cards came in bags, and each card had a few foolish words-\"Be Mine\" or \"I like you\" or \"You've Got My Heart\" or the uninteresting words, \"Hi, Valentine!\" I would sign my name on the cards quickly and the name of one of my classmates on each easily-broken envelope. I would lick  each one shut, but they were so cheap that the envelopes rarely had enough glue. On Valentine's Day, I would take the cards to school-everyone did. We would have a party in our classroom, with cupcakes and juice and tiny candy hearts, which also had Valentine messages printed on them-\"You're sweet\" or \"Cupid \"or \"Love\".\nAh, love! That's the Valentine's Day message: love. No one knows for certain the origin of the holiday. Several, Catholic victims were named Valentine, but it's difficult to separate legend from fact. One story tells of a priest named Valentine who was imprisoned and may have been stoned to death around 270 for performing marriages in going against the orders of the Roman Emperor Claudius II. But it's hard today to find any religious connection.", "id": "high11619.txt"}
