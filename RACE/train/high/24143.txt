This trip was going to be unpleasant and I knew in advance that no real good would come out of it. This is my annual \"Guilt Trip\".\nI got tickets to fly there on \"WISH-I-HAD\" airlines. It was an extremely short flight. I chose to carry my bag myself all the way. It was loaded down with a thousand memories of \"what might have been\". No one greeted me as I entered the Regret City International Airport. I spoke international language because people from all over the world came to this dismal town.\nAs I arrived at my destination and checked into the \"Last Resort\" Hotel, I noticed that they would be hosting the year's most important event--the annual \"Pity Party\".\nI wasn't going to miss that great social occasion. Many of the town's leading citizens would be there. First, there would be the \"Done\" family; \"Should Have\", \"Would Have\" and \"Could Have\". Then came the \"I Had\" family. Of course, the \"Opportunities\" family; \"Missed and Lost\" would be present. The biggest family there would be the \"Yesterday's\". There were far too many of them to count, but each one would have a very sad story to share. \nI went to this depressing party. And, as usual, I became very depressed. But as I thought about all of the stories of failures brought back from the past, it occurred to me that this trip and \"pity parties\" could be cancelled by ME!\nI started to realize that I did not have to be there. I can't change yesterday, but I do have the power to make today a wonderful day. I can be happy, as well as being encouraging.\nKnowing this, I left Regret City immediately. Am I sorry for mistakes I've made in the past? YES! But there is no way to undo them. So, if you're planning a trip back to Regret City, please cancel it now. Instead, take a trip to a nice place called \"Starting Again\".", "id": "high24143.txt"}
