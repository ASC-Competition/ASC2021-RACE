I was conscious of my accident and friends, and family passing out at the sight of me. It was no picnic!\nLate one evening ,I could hear the nurses in the next room repeatedly talking to a new patient. \"Sandy, your mom is here. Open your eyes. \" This had gone on throughout the night. \"Sandy ,your dad has some flowers for you. Open your eyes and look at them. \" I asked the nurse as she checked in on me what had happened to Sandy. The nurse said that Sandy was about 17 and had been involved in a car wreck. She was in a deep coma  , not in good shape. Over the next few nights ,I started talking to Sandy. Although, it was said silently, I started to urge her to open her eyes or say something. Her parents visited with me one evening, and they seemed to be from an important family but in much grief, much like the faces of those that had visited me. And there I was speechless, immobile and had no real way of easing  their pain. It became very important to me to pray for her recovery, not my own. In some strange way, I believed that if Sandy would just open her eyes ,my own situation would get better.\nSandy never came out of the coma as far as I know. During my stay in hospital, there were many times I felt like I was in an emotional coma. But I still could hear \"just open your eyes. \" Even now I think of her quite often. I remember the long nights in the hospital, the smell of the hospital environment and the helplessness we all felt. Even though Sandy's situation was bad, I am thankful for understanding what it means to let go of your own problems and concentrate on others.", "id": "high23684.txt"}
