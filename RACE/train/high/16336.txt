This familiar environmentalist slogan tells us how to reduce the amount of rubbish that ends up in landfills and waterways. The concept is being used to deal with one possibly dangerous form of waste -- electronic junk  , such as old computers, cell phones, and televisions. But this process for managing e-waste may be used in an\nway more often than not used, a recent report suggests.\n\"A lot of these materials are being sent to developing nations under the excuse of reuse -- to bridge the digital divide,\" said Richard Gutierrez, a policy researcher.\nOne of the problems is that no one proves whether these old machines work before they hit the seaways. Because of this, the report says, e-waste is a growing problem in Lagos, Nigeria, and elsewhere in the developing world. Much of the waste ends up being thrown away along rivers and roads. Often it's picked apart by poor people, who may face dangerous exposure to poisonous chemicals in the equipment.\nBusinessmen also pay workers a little money to get back materials such as gold and copper. This low-tech recovery process could expose workers and the local environment to many dangerous materials used to build electronics. According to Gutierrez, this shadow economy exists because the excuse of recycling and reusing electronics gives businessmen \"a green passport\" to ship waste around the globe. \"Developing nations must take upon some of the responsibility themselves,\" Gutierrez said. But, he added, \"A greater portion of this responsibility should fall on the exporting state.\"\nChina, for example, has become a dumping place for large amounts of e-waste. The nation is beginning to take action to stop the flow of dangerous materials across its borders. The Chinese government, after many years of denial is finally beginning to take the lead.", "id": "high16336.txt"}
