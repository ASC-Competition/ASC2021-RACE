He made a living by cleaning leather shoes for others in the street. Tom was also a clever boy.\nOne day, a very rich man with the name Miser appeared in front of Tom. He watched his dirty shoes for a while, and then looked at Tom. Tom knew this kind of people well: they love money very much and hate to spend it.\nTom said, \"Let me clean your shoes, sir.\"\n\"For nothing?\" the rich man asked.\n\"Only two pence, sir.\"\nMr Miser shook his head and walked away.\nTom thought for a moment and then called out, \"I'd like to clean it for nothing!\" This time Mr Miser agreed. And soon one of his shoes was shining brightly.\nWhen the rich man put his other shoe on the stool , Tom said he wouldn't clean it for him unless he was paid two pence for his work. Mr Miser was very angry. He refused to pay anything and went away with a smile on his face.\nBut to his surprise, the well-cleaned shoe was so bright that it made the other one look even dirtier. Mr Miser took a look around. People in the street were laughing at him. He couldn't walk on any further.\nFinally the rich man returned and gave Tom two pence. In a very short time his two shoes shone brightly.", "id": "high2453.txt"}
