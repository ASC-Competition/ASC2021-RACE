And it is also love that has such power to overcome all difficulties. So we say: \"Love will find a way.\" As smile is a facial expression showing pleasure, affection, and friendliness, it is the commonest way to show our good will perfectly without saying anything. A Chinese saying runs: \"never hit a person who is smiling at you.\" It is a time-proven fact that the smile is a language all its own-- a universal language--understood by the people of every nation in the world. We may not speak the same tongue as our foreign neighbors, but we smile in the same tongue. We need no interpreter for thus expressing love, happiness, or good will.\nOne day while shopping in a small town in southern California, it was my misfortune to be approached by a clerk whose personality contradicted mine. He seemed most unfriendly and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I bought nothing, and marched angrily out of the store. My anger toward that grew with each step. Outside, standing at the corner, was a dark-complexion young man in his early twenties. His expressive brown eyes met and held mine, and in the next instant a beautiful, dazzling smile covered his face. I gave in immediately. The magnetic power of that shining smile drove away all bitterness within me, and I found the muscles in my own face happily responding. \"Beautiful day, isn't it?\" I remarked, in passing. Then, suddenly something inside me sent me turning back. \"I really owe you a debt of gratitude,\" I said softly. His smile deepened, but he made no attempt to answer. A Mexican woman and two men were standing nearby. The woman stepped forward and eyed me inquiringly. \"Carlos, he no speak English,\" she volunteered. \"You want I should tell him something?\" In that moment I felt transformed. Carlos' smile had made a big person of me. My friendliness and good will toward all mankind stood ten feet tall. \"Yes,\" my reply was enthusiastic and sincere, \"tell him I said 'Thank you!'\" \"Thank you?\" The woman seemed slightly puzzled. I gave her arm a friendly pat as I turned to leave. \"Just tell him that,\" I insisted. \"He'll understand. I am sure!\" Oh, what a smile can do! Although I have never seen that young man again, I shall never forget the lesson he taught me that morning.\nFrom that day on, I became smile - conscious, and I practice that diligently, anywhere and everywhere, with everybody. When I got excited in traffic, taking the right-of-way   from the other car with my stupid mistake, I'd smile and shrug my shoulders apologetically. This action on my part would always draw a good-natured smile in return. If the other fellow was at fault - and if I could remember my resolution in time! - he'd get a broad smile of understanding. This took a bit of doing at first. I'll admit it wasn't always easy, but it was fun. The results were sometimes amazing. Many times, a broad, friendly smile would completely turn aside ill-feeling and tension. I'm wondering now how many tragic accidents could be avoided on our overcrowded highways, if every driver remembered to smile!", "id": "high7305.txt"}
