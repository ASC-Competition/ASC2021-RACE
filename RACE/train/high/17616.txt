The company estimates  that this is set to reach $350,000 by 2023 if costs continue to increase at the same rate.\nThe report will be a further blow for hard-working families as cash-strapped  parents continue to struggle with rising household bills, wage freezes and cuts to child benefit. The right to receive the payments, worth $20.30 a week for the first child and $13.40 further children, was removed earlier this month from households with one earner on a salary of more than $60,000 and reduced for families where one member is paid more than $50,000.\nThe research published today shows costs have risen in all areas over the last decade, except for clothing, with education seeing the biggest increase. As a result, more than three-quarters of parents have been forced to make ends meet. According to LV, more than four in ten are reining in spending on luxuries  such as holidays, a third are also cutting back how much they spend on essentials such as food.\nEducation remains the biggest expense for parents. The cost of education, including uniforms, after school clubs and university costs, has shot up from $32,593 to $72,832 per child in the last ten years.\nChildcare costs have also rocketed, up from $39,613 in 2003 to $63,738 today.", "id": "high17616.txt"}
