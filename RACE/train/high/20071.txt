In their opinion, dialects carry and preserve local culture . They say that a dialect is not only a linguistic tool. But is also like a person's \"birthmark\" and part of their local identity and feeling of belonging.\nThey recommended that TV and radio stations set up channels and programs using dialects , and that schools offer selective courses in which the dialects are taught. The experts also suggested that dialect be protected while maintaining high standards of Putonghua and a multicultural environment in the city.", "id": "high20071.txt"}
