Her home was in the countryside, but she did not want to go back there every night, so she bought an expensive house in the centre of the city, got some beautiful furniture and got a man to paint the rooms in new colours.\nIt was very difficult to get tickets for her show, because everybody wanted to see it.

He took the tickets without saying anything, and she heard no more about them until the end of the month, when she got the painter's bill  .
