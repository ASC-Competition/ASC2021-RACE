Because he cannot fight back, he takes out his anger on an anthill in his front yard. He stamps it, squirts  it with his water gun, and floods it. One wizard ant, Zoc, makes Lucas as little as an ant and Lucas has to work and live in the ants' county. During his staying with the ants, Lucas learns the value of friendship and teamwork, and finally gains the things he wants most: friendship and the courage to stand up for himself.\nI really enjoyed this movie. It's a fun movie for the whole family. I had really good laughs and enjoyed being there.                                       --James\nI went to see this film today with my 8-year-old daughter, really without knowing too much about it. My daughter and I were pleasantly surprised at how funny it was. We just couldn't help laughing. I would recommend  this film for the whole family.            --Mary\nI've seen several movies of this kind, like Antz or Bugs Life, but this one blows them both away as having greater movie qualities. The film is so well made --some of the scenes are unbelievably beautiful.                                                   --John\nI would recommend their movie to everyone. Whether you go with family or friends, I honestly think this movie has something you will really enjoy.                  --Sam", "id": "high20805.txt"}
