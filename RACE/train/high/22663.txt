It was an eye-opener to see the destruction and waste popular in the world's fisheries. TheAlaskafishery is very well managed and we do not see the damage occurring elsewhere. Many local people complain of the many restrictive   laws in the fishery, but after reading these articles, I'm in favor of even stricter regulation. The sea is the basis for life on Earth, and we must take care of it.\nTom Hagen\nCraig, Alaska\nYour report presents an overly hopeless future. Here in New England where I have fished commercially for 45 years, we are beginning a recovery from years of over fishing. Under the newly authorized Magnuson-Stevens Act, fishermen are forming partnerships with scientists for the purpose of developing fishing-gear modifications   to reduce by-catch and reduce impacts   to fish habitat. Additionally, we are collecting information on fish stock abundance, population, and ecosystems. The New England Regional Fishery Management Council is supporting the formation of harvest districts, which enables fishermen to have changing market conditions.                                                                    \nFrank Mirarchi\n                                                Scituate,Massachusetts \nYou described fishing around the world, but not here in the United States. There is no support for the American fisherman who is working under the harshest regulations on Earth and the strictest restrictions. We are fishing in a fashion that is completely suitable as required in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. TheU.S.keeps importing more fish from countries that have no requirements on gear or on their catch.U.S.fishermen cannot compete with foreign prices, so the fishermen's numbers have been reduced. There are no young people who will take our place.\n                                                 Jeremiah O'Brien\n                                                 MorroBay,California", "id": "high22663.txt"}
