His big, deep voice rumbles out of radios and juke-boxes across North America. His records sell by the million. Country-music fans everywhere, know his big hits. They love songs like \"Hey Porter\", \"Ring of Fire\", and \"Folsom Prison Blue\".\nJohnny Cash sings about a hundred concerts a year. People like what they hear--and what they see, too. Rugged and big-shouldered, the singer stands six-two without his black boots on. He's a two-hundred-pound package of muscle and talent. And that scar on his cheek? It's a bullet hole, of course!\nIn the minds of most people, Johnny Cash is \"Mr Tough( violent) Guy\". He's an ex-drug addict  who was once put in prison. His grandmother was an Indian. To keep from starving he once had to live on wild rabbits killed from forty feet away with a knife. Some people say he even killed a man.\nIn fact, most of the Johnny Cash story is just that--a story. True, years ago he had a \"drug habit \"for a short time. He \"popped\" pills. But he never used heroin or other \"hard \"drugs. Sometimes he'd go wild and get locked up for a few hours. But he never served a prison sentence.\nThere's no Indian blood in his veins. He's been a killer only in song. As for the \"bullet hole\", it's an old scar left by a doctor who opened a cyst .\nPeople who know Johnny Cash well say he's a \"gentle guy\", a \"generous guy'--anything but a \"tough guy\". How did the stories get started? Some of them, like the story about the \"Indian grandmother\", he made up long ago to add excitement to his career. Others, like the \"bullet hole\" , simply got started. Now there's little the singer can do to change people's minds. \"They just want to believe it,\" he says.", "id": "high21394.txt"}
