When the bundle was in her arms and she moved the fold of cloth to look upon his tiny face, she gasped. The doctor turned quickly and looked out of the tall hospital window. The baby had been born without ears.\nTime proved that the baby' s hearing was perfect. It was only his appearance that was imperfect. When he rushed home from school one day and threw himself into his mother's arms, she sighed , knowing that his life was to be unfortunate. He cried to his mum \"A boy, a big boy... called me a freak  .\"\nHe grew up, handsome. A favorite with his fellow students, he might have been class president, but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music. \"But you might communicate with other young people,\" his mother blamed him, but felt a kindness in her heart.\nTwo years went by. One day, his father said to the son, \"You' re going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have someone who will donate the ears you need. But it' s a secret.\" The operation was a great success, and a new person appeared.\nLater he married and became a lawyer. One day, he asked his father, \"Who gave me the ears? Who gave me so much? I could never do enough for him or her.\" \"I do not believe you could,\" said the father, \"but the agreement was that you are not to know... not yet.\"\nThe years kept their secret, but the day did come. He stood with his father over his mother' s casket. Slowly, tenderly, the father stretched forth a hand and raised the thick, reddish brown hair to show the mother had no outer ears.\n\"Mother said she was glad she never let her hair be cut,\" his father whispered gently, \"and nobody ever thought Mother less beautiful, did they?\"", "id": "high1910.txt"}
