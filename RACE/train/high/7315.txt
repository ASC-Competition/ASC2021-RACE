But it isn't. It's in Washington D.C. It's called the Library of Congress.\nPresident John Adams started the library in 1800 for members of Congress. He wanted them to be able to read books about law. The first 740 books were bought in England. They were simply set up in the room where Congress met. Then Thomas Jefferson sold Congress many of his own books. He felt Congress should have books on all subjects, not just on law. This idea changed the library forever.\nThe library grew and grew. Now it covers a large area of land. It contains20million books as well as many pictures, movies, globes and machines. Experts in every field work there. Hundreds of people call every day with all kinds of questions. Many of them get answers right over the phone.\nThe library is a huge storehouse. Thomas Edison's first movie and Houdini's magic books are preserved there. And it is the proud owner of the world's best collection of humorous books.", "id": "high7315.txt"}
