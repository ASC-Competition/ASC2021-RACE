Instead they complain  about their problems and difficulties as if life should be easy. It seems to them that difficulties stand for a special kind of suffering especially forced on them or else on their families, their class, or even their nation.\nWhat makes life difficult is that the process of facing and solving problems is a painful one. Problems, depending on their nature, cause sadness, or loneliness  or regret or anger or fear.\nThese are uncomfortable feelings, often as painful as any kind of physical pain. And since life causes a lot of problems, life is always difficult and is full of pain as well as joy.\nYet, it is in this whole process of solving problems that life has its meaning. Problems are the serious test that tells us success from failure.
