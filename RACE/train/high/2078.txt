The company started marketing the model, the LF1300 on Sep.18.No other people but the blind and visually-impaired with a certificate  can buy the talking phone at sales shops of LG Electronics.\n\"The LF1300 is the world's first mobile phone that is capable of reading books for the print-disabled, who otherwise could not enjoy them.This is not about making money but about continuing to put froth efforts to reduce the digital difference for the disabled,\" LG Vice President said.\nIts users can download about 300 audio books from the Internet site of LG Sangam Library to their phones for free in two ways. One is to access the digital library's Website on a computer designed for the blind to get the audio books and transfer them to cell phones. The other is to download the digital books directly with cell phones through the wireless net work by touching a hot key on the LF1300 phone.\nOn top of its unique feature of reading books, the LF1300 is no worse than the pupular top-line phones in both outlooks and frnctionalities . The phone is armed with an MP3 player and a Bluetooth headset, enabling users to listen to the music or talk without a cord. The user interface  of the LF1300 is also designed for the blind,enabling phone users to control it through a voice guidance system.\nHowever, because the phone's internal mimory of 17MB is small even for a single audio book file, which takes up 80MB on average, a high-volume external memory is a must for the talking book services.", "id": "high2078.txt"}
