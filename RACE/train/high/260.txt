Everybody in the United States knew him and many people wished to have a picture or something of his in their homes.\nSoon after the war the general returned to Washington. One day he went to a dentist and had six teeth pulled out. A week later the general heard that his teeth were being sold in curiosity shops as $ 5 each. On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: \"Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home.\" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.\nThe officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth.", "id": "high260.txt"}
