The promoters (;) of products say they can shape the legs, slim the face, smooth wrinkles, or in some other way to beauty or desirability.\nOften such products are nothing more than money--making things for their promoter. The results they produce are questionable, and some are dangerous to health.\nTo understand how these products can be legally promoted to the public, it is necessary to understand something of the laws covering their regulation  . If the product is a drug, FDA(Food Drug Administration) can require proof  under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that is safe and effective before it is put on the market . But if the product is a device, FDA. has no author to require premarketing proof of safety or effectiveness. If a product already on the marker is a danger to health, FDA can request the producer or distributor to remove it from the market voluntarily, or it can take legal action , including seizure   of the product.\nOne notable case a few years ago involved an electrical device called the Relaxacisor, which had been sold for reducing the waistline. The Relaxacisor produced electrical shocks to the body through contact pads. FDA took legal action against the distributor to stop the sale of the device  on the grounds that it was dangerous to health and life.\nObviously, most of the devices on the market have never been the subject of court proceedings ,and new devices appear continually. Before buying, it is up to the consumer to judge the safety or effectiveness of such items.", "id": "high647.txt"}
