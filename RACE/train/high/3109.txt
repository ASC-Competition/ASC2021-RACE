I prefer students begin at an earlier age. Robby insisted that it had always been his mother's dream to hear him play the piano, so I took him in as a student.\nRobby tried and tried while I listened and encouraged him and gave him more instructions  . But he just did not have any inborn ability.\nI only saw his mother from a distance. She always waved and smiled but never came in. Then one day Robby stopped coming to our lessons. I thought about calling him but I guessed he had decided to try something else.\n _ . However, several weeks before the recital   of my students, Robby came,telling me that he never stopped practicing and begged me to allow him to take part. I agreed but I made him perform last in the program, so I could always save his poor performance through my \"curtain closer\".\nI was surprised when he announced that he had chosen one piece of Mozart's. Never had I heard a piece of Mozart's played so well by someone at his age. When he finished, everyone was cheering.\nI ran up and put my arms around Robby in joy. \"I've never heard you play like that, Robby!  How'd you do it?\"\n\"Well, Miss Hondorf. Do you remember I told you my mom was sick? Actually she died this morning. She was born deaf so tonight was the first time she could hear me play. I wanted to make it special. I knew I could.\"  That night, Robby was the teacher and I was the student. He taught me so many important things about life.", "id": "high3109.txt"}
