That saying is \"A rolling stone gathers no moss \".It has several meanings. One meaning is that a person who never settles down in one place will not be successful. Another is that someone who is always moving, with no roots in one place, avoids responsibilities.\nThis proverb was said to be first used in the 1500s. But in the 1960s, the expression \"rolling stone\" became famous in the world of rock-and-roll music. It became the name of a song, a rock group and a magazine.\nExperts say it all started with a song by the American singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. He was one of the country's top blues musicians until his death in 1983. His music influenced singers like Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. In 1950, Muddy Waters recorded a song called \"Rolling Stone\".\nA British rock group is said to have taken its name from Muddy Waters' song. The Rolling Stones performed for the first time in 1962.The group's members called themselves \"the world's greatest rock-and-roll band\".\nIn 1965, Bob Dylan released  his song \"Like a Rolling Stone\".It is one of his best known and most influential works.\nIt is an angry song about a woman who was once rich and successful. But now she is on her own, \"with no direction home, like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone\".\nIn 1967, a young man named Jann Wenner started a magazine and he named it \"Rolling Stone\". The magazine reported on rock music and the popular culture that the music created. By 1971, \"Rolling Stone\" had become the leading rock music and counterculture publication. It is still popular today.", "id": "high8260.txt"}
