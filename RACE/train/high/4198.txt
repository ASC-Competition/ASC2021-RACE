The goal is to \"help prevent traffic accidents, free up people's time and reduce carbon emissions.\" says Sebastian Thrun, who is the project leader for the driverless car, or Carbot.\nBy developing the car and the software that drives it, Google wants to change how people get from place to p1ace. Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top officials, said, \"Your car should drive itself. It just makes sense.\"\nSo far, the driverless autos have gone about 140,000 miles on California roads without people taking over the driving. Many of the roads are very busy or full of curves that challenge human drivers. The autos' software makes it possible to know speed limits, traffic patterns and road maps. The vehicles use radar, lasers and video cameras to find other cars and avoid people crossing streets.\nThere has only been one accident during the testing. And in that case, the Carbot was hit from behind by a human driver when Goog1e's car was stopped at a red light. Engineers say the driverless cars are safer than autos with people behind the wheel because the computers react much more quickly than humans.\nThe Carbot is still in very early testing stages. Experts agree that it will be years before you will be able to buy one. But it is likely that one day you will be sitting in the driver's seat of a driverless car. When the auto was first invented it was called a \"horseless carriage\". Now it seems that it is time for the \"driverless carriage\" to be part of our 1ives.", "id": "high4198.txt"}
