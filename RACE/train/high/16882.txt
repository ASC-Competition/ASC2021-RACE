Now, they would no longer have to walk long distances looking for water. At last, they had a source   of water what they call their own.\nBut several days later, two young boys saw something they had never seen before--a huge animal was standing at the edge of the lake, eating grass. When the animal saw the boys, it walked into the lake and disappeared   beneath the water.\nRegis looked into the story of the big creature that vanished into to the lake. \"When I took a closer look at the dung  , I realized that it was from a hippo  ,\" he said.\nTwelve hippos were living in the lake. The villagers were worried. In the countrry of Zimbabwe, hippos attack humans more often than lions do. The hippos would often stay on the village side of the lake all day. This meant that the villagers could not go near the lake until the hippos got out. It was too long a wait for the villagers, because they needed the water from the lake to survive  . \"This is the only source of fresh water in the village,\" said a villager. \"There is no way we can avoid this lake.\" So the women began moving in groups whenever they went to get water from the lake. Before collecting water, they made sure no hippos were nearby. The men began fishing in pairs, with one man always looking out for hippos.\nIt took time, but these days, the hippos and humans live side by side. The villagers say that when the hippos find people coming, they swim slowly to the other side of the lake and mind their own business. The villagers do not go into the part of the lake where the hippos usually stay. They have learned to share the lake they both need to survive.", "id": "high16882.txt"}
