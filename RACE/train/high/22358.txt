Today, she is in theUnited Statesand she has a job. Castro works behind the counter at McDoald's. Speed is an important part of her work life. Fast - food counter workers are expected to serve customers in less than a minute. At McDonald's they say, \"Work fast or you don't last.\"\n       Are McDonald's workers lucky to have their jobs? Or are they being _ ? The answer depends on who you talk to.\n       McDoald's does many good things. For example, no other company hires more young people than McDonald's. More than half of its workers are under 20 years old. McDonald's also has a good record of hiring minority workers. Thirteen percent of its workers are black.

As one worker put it, \"They expect a lot and they don't pay you much.\"", "id": "high22358.txt"}
