At other crossroads, drivers have to go slow, but they do not actually have to stop (unless, of course, there is something coming along the main road); and at still others, they do not have either to stop or to go slow, because they are themselves on the main road.\nMr. Williams, who was always a very careful driver, was driving home from work one evening when he came to a crossroads. It had a \"Slow\" sign, so he slowed down when he came to the main road, looked both ways to see that nothing was coming, and then drove across without stopping completely.\nAt once he heard a police whistle, so he pulled in to the side of the road and stopped. A policeman walked over to him with a notebook and pencil in his hand and said, \"You didn't stop at the crossing.\" \"But the sign there doesn't say \"Stop\",\" answered Mr. Williams. \"It just says \"Slow\", and I did go slow.\"  The policeman looked around him, and a look of surprise came over his face. Then he put his notebook and pencil away, scratched his head and said, \"Well, I'll be scolded. I am in the wrong street!\"", "id": "high21949.txt"}
