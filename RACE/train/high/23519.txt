When worms pass the leaves, their waste can help to make the soil rich, from which the plants use to get their nutrition. The plants grow and provide food for animals. When the animals eat the plants, their waste goes back into the soil. It's a perfect cycle.\nBut at the Elephant Conservation Centre in Lampang, Northern Thailand, they are using elephant waste for something more--to make 100% natural, beautiful color1ful paper products! 100 years ago over 100,000 elephants in prefix = st1 /Thailandworked on farms, building sites and even in the army. However, only 6,000 remain there today because of advances in technology that have made elephants' old word less necessary. Elephants are doing new jobs now, including entertaining tourists by painting and playing football, and now by helping in the paper making industry. And their keepers, called Mahouts, can earn a living for their families and help their elephants by using elephant waste, also called \"dung\" to make beautiful, natural, paper products without any bad smell.\nEvery day an adult elephant eats about 200kg of plants like bamboo, grass and watermelon seeds.  His body system breaks the plants into 50kg of fibers, which can produce 115 sheets of fibrous paper.\nThe first step to make this special natural paper is to collect the fiber rich \"dung\" from the elephant.  The next step is to wash it and boil it for five hours to kill bacteria. (The water the use in this process is reused to water plans at the Centre, which, in turn, feed the elephants).  After it's boiled, they cut fibers up. During the cutting process, they add in the desired color1 of the paper. For the fourth step, they take the mixture and make balls of 300g. Each ball is then speeds lightly over bamboo frames to dry into one large sheet of paper. After a few hours in the sun, the sheets are dry enough to remove. The result is a wonderful, 100% natural, recycled paper. People around the world are getting interested in buying this special elephant paper for their holiday cards, writing paper and much more, because it's beautiful, natural and helps so many.", "id": "high23519.txt"}
