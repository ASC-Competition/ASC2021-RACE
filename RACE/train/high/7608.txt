The neighborhood is a workingclass community. People do not have very much money, and they have limited access to fresh food in markets.\nOver the past two years, the farm has attracted volunteers from the community like Marcy Clark. She schools her four children at home. On a recent day she brought them to Eco City Farms for a lesson. Her son Alston Clark thinks his experience is very valuable. \"I like coming out here,\" he says, \"You know, you connect with the earth, where your food comes from. You appreciate the food a little bit more.\"\nMargaret Morgan started Eco City Farms. She thinks of it as a place where people can learn to live healthier lives. \"Growing food in a community brings people together,\" she continues, \"Every piece of what we do here is a demonstration to show people everything about how to have an ecofriendly community.\" she says. From the Eco City Farms people come to know that they are not only growing food and raising chickens and bees, but improving the soil with compost   made from food waste.\nEco City Farms is an experimental operation. The farm gets its power not from the local electricity networks, but from the sun with solar panels. In winter, the green houses use a geothermal   system.\nVegetables can be grown all year. So once a week, all winter long, neighbors like Chris Moss and her three children bike to the farm to pick up a share of the harvest.\n\"I like eating the vegetables,\" says fiveyearold Owen Moss.", "id": "high7608.txt"}
