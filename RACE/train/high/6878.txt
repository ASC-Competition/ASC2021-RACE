Less than half said the devices were used for classwork.\nTexting was the most popular distraction  technique at 86 percent, while 68 percent said they used their phones to check personal emails. Two thirds used social networks, 38 percent surfed the web and eight percent admitted to playing games when they should have been studying.\nDespite eight out of ten students admitting their devices were distracting, fewer than five percent considered it to be a \"very big\" distraction.\n\"I don't think students necessarily think it's a big problem,\" said McCoy said. \"They think it's part of their lives.\"\n\"It's become automatic behavior on the part of so many people - they do it without even thinking about it.\"\nHe continued, \"They've got their laptops open, but they're not always taking notes. Some might have two screens open -- Facebook and their notes.\"", "id": "high6878.txt"}
