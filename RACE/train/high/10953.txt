They include five role playing games (RPG), four recreation and chess games, and one educational game, such as \"Warring States II Online,\" \"Rainbow Island Online,\" and \"Wonderlands of learning and games.\"\nThese games have made their way into the final recommendation list because they are considered \"healthy\" and can \"enhance intelligence,\" according to the ministry.\nThe ministry hoped the list could serve a a guidance for parents to better direct their children in the winter vacation, which usually lasts nearly two months from January to February each year.\nThis was the third time for the ministry to publish recommended cyber games list. The previous two were made public respectively in January 2006 and August 2005 with a total of 25 games inlisted.\nIn the past few years, on- line games have become the favorite pastime of young people. However, it is argued that such social problems as game addiction, juvenile delinquency   and perversion among minors by on-line violence and pornography   have come from an inadequately regulated Internet.\nAbout 9.72 percent of Chinese netizens between the ages of 13 and 30 suffer Internet addiction, said a report issued last month by the China Youth Association for Network Development (CYAND).\nAccording to the China Internet Network Information Center (CINIC), the main Internet watchdog, China had 210million Internet users at the end of 2007 and its online population is on course to become the world's largest at the beginning of this year.\nNet users between 18 and 30 accounted for 49.9percent of the total users. Although the CINIC did not give the figure of those below 18, teenagers and youths have obviously taken up more than half of the total number of net users. And the number of users under age 18 increased rapidly last year, the CINIC noted.", "id": "high10953.txt"}
