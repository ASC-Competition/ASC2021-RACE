This is because women traditionally make decisions about spending.\nUsers were more likely to shop online to save time. Internet users between the ages 18 and 29 were responsible for some of the most dramatic increase in the online gift-buying population this time around.\nHowever, three- quarters of the US Internet users did not buy holiday gifts online in 2004. They worried about credit card security, or just compared online prices with off-line prices, then dashed off to the shops to get the best deals.\n\" But even if shoppers don't buy online , websites are becoming promotion tools for stores,\" said Dan Hess, vice president of ComScore Networks Inc. Hess said that actually most stores' websites can make customers fully believe the security of their credit card numbers. And most are able to ensure that gifts arrive on time.\n\" It's all about making the shopping experience more efficient, more reliable and more comfortable.\" Hess said.", "id": "high632.txt"}
