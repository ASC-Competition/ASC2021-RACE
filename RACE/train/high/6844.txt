The houses were made of wood. These cottages once housed early settlers as they worked the dry Montana soil; now they hold Twitter engineers.\nThe cottages could be an example of the industry' s odd love affair with \"low technology,\" a concept associated with the natural world, and with old-school craftsmanship   that exists long before the Internet era. Low technology is not virtual   --so, to take advantage of it, Internet companies have had to get creative. The rescued wood cottages, fitted by hand in the late eighteen-hundreds, are an obvious example, but Twitter's designs lie on the extreme end. Other companies are using a broader interpretation   of low technology that focuses on nature.\nAmazon is building three glass spheres filled with trees, so that employees can \"work and socialize in a more natural, park-like setting.\" At Google's office, an entire floor is carpeted in glass. Facebook's second Menlo Park campus will have a rooftop park with a walking trail.\nOlle Lundberg, the founder of Lundberg Design, has worked with many tech companies over the years. \"We have lost the connection to the maker in our lives, and our tech engineers are the ones who feel impoverished   , because they're surrounded by the digital world,\" he says. \"They're looking for a way to regain their individual identity, and we've found that introducing real crafts is one way to do that.\"\nThis craft based theory is rooted in history, William Morris, the English artist and writer, turned back to pre-industrial arts in the eighteen-sixties, just after the Industrial Revolution. The Arts and Crafts movement defined itself against machines. \"Without creative human occupation, people became disconnected from life,\" Morris said.\nResearch has shown that natural environments can restore  our mental capacities. In Japan, patients are encouraged to \"forest-bathe,\" taking walks through woods to lower their blood pressure.\nThese health benefits apply to the workplace as well. Rachel Kaplvin, a professor of environmental psychology, has spent years researching the restorative effects of natural environment. Her research found that workers with access to nature at the office--even simple views of trees and flowers--felt their jobs were less stressful and more satisfying. If low-tech offices can potentially nourish the brains and improve the mental health of employees then, fine, bring on the cottages.", "id": "high6844.txt"}
