So this year she did something more than a hobby :She planted vegetables in her yard. For her first garden, Ms. Feeley has put in 15 tomato plants, and five rows of a variety of vegetables.

This year she has made it much larger because, she said, \"The cost of everything is going up and I was looking to lose a few pounds, too;so it's a win-win situation all around.\"\nThey are among the growing number of Americans who, driven by higher living costs and a falling economy , have taken up vegetable gardening for the first time. Others have increased the size of their existing gardens. Seed companies and garden shops say that not since the 1970s there has been such an increase in interest in growing food at home.
