Their research is based on the identification of three genes that help prolong lives and prevent diseases which occur in old age. Medically controlling the proteins made by the \" longevity genes\" will allow millions to live longer, predicts Dr Nir Barzilai.\nThose whose DNA strongly features the three genes are 80 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's. The genes also fight against the deadly impact of smoking, poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise.\nAlready, several laboratories are working on a pill to imitate the benefits of the genes and Dr Barzilai thinks it could be tested within three years. The pill could remove some diseases that damage old age. \" The advantage of finding a gene that involves longevity is that we can develop a drug that will imitate exactly what this gene is doing,\" he said.\nOf the three longevity genes, two genes increase the production of so-called good cholesterol , which reduces the risk of heart disease. The third prevents diabetes. They were discovered by Dr Barzilai's team while studying the DNA of 500 Ashkenazi Jews with an average age of 100. The chances of living that long are one in 10,000 but the group, which shared relatively few common ancestors, was 20 times more likely to hit the entury. Dr Barzilai said: \" 30 percent of them were obese or overweight and 30 percent smoked two acks of cigarettes a day for more than 40 years, however they can live to 100.\"\nBut Andrew Ketteringham of the Alzheimer's Society said: \"Alzheimer's disease, a most common disease, is likely to be caused by a combination of genetic disosition , lifestyles and life events. Many genes are probably involved.", "id": "high4117.txt"}
