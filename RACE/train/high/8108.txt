On a Saturday morning last autumn.I had gone to town to do some shopping and as I was on my way home,it suddenly began to rain. I at once ran into a nearby phone box because I didn't have an umbrella.It was raining so heavily that I have to stay in the phone box until it stopped.\nA few moments later,I saw a young man walk up to the phone box,wearing a yellow raincoat and holding a box. I didn't want to go out into the rain,so I picked up the phone and pretended  I was talking to someone. I thought the man would go away,but he didn't. He just waited in the rain,watching me. I had to wave my hands about and acted as if I was deep in conversation.\nLuckily,it began to stop after about ten minutes.\"Okay,Mum,\" I said loudly into the phone,\"I'll see you later Bye!\" I put the phone down, picked up my shopping bag and walked out of the phone box \"I'm sorry I took so long,\"I said to the man.\n\"Oh, I don't want to use the phone,\"he replied, smiling.\"I've just come to repair it. It's out of order.you see.\" I felt myself go red in the face and I hurried away with my head down,feeling a complete fool. That was certainly one of the most embarrassing moments of my life!", "id": "high8108.txt"}
