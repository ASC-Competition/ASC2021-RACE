The company Terrafugia, based in Woburn, Massachusetts, says it plans to deliver its car-plane, the Transition, to customers by the end of 2012.\n\"It's next 'wow' vehicle,\" said Terrafugia vice president Richard Gersh. \"Anybody can buy a Ferrari, but as we say, Ferraris don't fly.\"\nThe car-plane has wings that unfold for flying-a process the company says takes one minute-and fold back up for driving. A runway is still required to take off and land.\nThe Transition is being marketed more as a plane that drives than a car that flies, although it is both. The company has been working with FAA to meet aircraft regulations, and with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to meet vehicle safety regulations.\nThe company is aiming to sell the Transition to private pilots as a more convenient and cheaper way to fly. They say it saves you the trouble from trying to find another mode of transportation to get to and from airports: You drive the car to the airport and then you're good to go. When you land, you hold up the wings and hit the road. There are no expensive parking fees because you don't have to store it at an airport-you park it in the garage at home.\nThe car-plane is designed to fly primarily under 10,000 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,430 pounds, including fuel and passengers. Thrrafugia says the Transition reduces the potential for an accident by allowing pilots to drive under the bad weather instead of flying into marginal  conditions.\nThe Transition's price tag: $194,000. But there may be additional charges for options like a radio, , a transponder or a GPS. Another option is a full-plane parachute.\n\"If you get into a very awful situation, it is the necessary safety option.\" Gersh said.\nSo far, the company has more than 70 orders with deposits. \"We're working very closely with them, but there are still some remaining steps,\" Brown said.", "id": "high432.txt"}
