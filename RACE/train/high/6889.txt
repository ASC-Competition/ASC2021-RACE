Have you been doing Internet shopping rather than going to the stores? What can't you be bothered to do?\nA study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle   that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs.\nJust over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising.\nAbout one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up.\nMore than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them.\nThis led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school.\nDr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, \"People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too.\"\n\"If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks.\"\nAnd Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%.\nThe results bring serious challenges for the National Health Service, where obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and cancer have been on a steady increase for the past 40 years and are costing billions of pounds every year.", "id": "high6889.txt"}
