The house should be safe for the baby,\" said my son Mark as he walked upstairs with his wife and fifteen-month-old Hannah.\nThey visited us for the Thanksgiving holiday. After driving all day from Salt Lake to Ft. Collins, his temper showed. \"That one finger rule may work with other kids, but never Hannah,\" he insisted.\nWhen my three granddaughters first moved into our house three years ago, my friend offered me her secret to behave grandchildren. \"Teach them the 'one finger rule'.\" All of her five grandchildren learned it at a young age and it proved to also work well with mine. \nI picked up my granddaughter and said, \"Well, Mark, just watch.\" I hugged her and walked all around the great room.\n\"Hannah, you may touch anything in this room you want, but, you can only use one finger.\" I showed the technique by touching my forefinger to the sculpture. Hannah followed my example. \"Good girl. Now what else would you like to touch?\"\nShe stretched her finger toward the lamp. I allowed her to touch everything in sight, plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, speakers, etc. If she started to grab , I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always obeyed. However, Hannah, an only child, possessed a more adventurous personality. Her father predicted it would prevent her from accepting the \"one finger rule\".\nDuring their four-day stay, we aided Hannah in remembering \"one finger rule\". She learned quickly. \nMonths later, my husband and I drove to Salt Lake. I watched Mark continue to practice the one finger rule. I smiled happily each time he asked Hannah to touch with \"one finger\".", "id": "high22164.txt"}
