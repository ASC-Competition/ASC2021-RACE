Irvine Robbins, who helped create this famous company, died in May at the age of ninety. His career of making fun and exciting ice cream flavors   changed the way Americans enjoy this food.\nIrvine Robbins opened his first ice cream store in 1945 in California. At the time, there were no stores that sold only ice cream. His sister's husband, Burton Baskin, also opened his own ice cream stores.\nIn 1948 they combined their six stores into one business. Baskin and Robbins realized that they were too busy to operate each store well. So, they decided to sell part of each operation to the manager of that store. This permitted the company to grow quickly.\nBy 1953, they renamed their company Baskin-Robbins. They advertised that they sold 31 kinds of ice cream to show the many choices buyers had. There was one flavor for every day of the month.\nRobbins and Baskin sold \"Lunar Cheesecake  \" the day after astronauts landed on the moon in 1969. Other flavors included \"ChaChaCha\", for cherry chocolate chip, and Robbins' personal favorite \"Jamoca Almond Fudge\". They said, \"We sell fun, not just ice cream.\"\nBy 1967, there were 500 Baskin-Robbins stores in the United States. The business partners sold their company that year. Today, there are more than 5,800 Baskin-Robbins stores around the world.", "id": "high6880.txt"}
