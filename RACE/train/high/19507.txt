Mom boiled a few dozen eggs and while they cooled, Dennis, Diane and I gathered supplies. We put some color1 powder in each of six bowls, added boiling water and vinegar, and then mixed them together. Before dipping an egg into one of the pretty color1s, I'd catch a crayon and carefully print \"Darlene\" on one egg. Dennis and Diane did the same. Then Mum and Dad put the eggs with our names and some presents in separate baskets. When we hunted on Easter morning, we'd be sure to get the right basket.\nBeing 8-year-old, I am quite familiar with the rule, and I explained to my younger sister, Diane: Firstly, if you find the basket with the others' egg in it, quietly put it back and continue the hunt. Secondly, if the basket with your egg in it isn't found by fifteen minutes before church, you have to continue looking for it after church. That year I was unlucky, I didn't find my basket before church, so I spent one more hour looking for my hunt.\nThe next Easter was a different story since I was lucky enough to find my basket first. I was jumping up and down, and staring at the big chocolate rabbit in my basket when Mom and Dad told us to get dressed. I proudly left my basket in the sun porch  before heading out of the door.\nAfter church, my sisters and brothers ran ahead, but I was pleased to walk between Mom and Dad since I'd already found my basket and huge chocolate rabbit. As I jumped up the porch steps I knew Dennis found his too, since he was laughing his head off.\n\"Hungry for chocolate soup? \" Dennis laughed. \"Chocolate soup?\" I was surprised. One look at Dennis pointed finger made me realize my beautiful chocolate rabbit was now a chocolate puddle . But I always think of the unforgettable Easters when I was a child.", "id": "high19507.txt"}
