She noticed that the woman asked the mon for the direction. He told her that he did not know. Galaxy decided to help them. She had learned the sign language when she served as a volunteer in the deaf and mute school. Then she showed the woman the direction and left her email address to them in case they needed her help later.\nShe received an email from that man the next day. Kazrim was his name. Galaxy replied his mail sincerely. They both started chatting online soon after and began seeing each other. Although they only communicated with the sign language, it never bothered her.\nGalaxy was fond of him gradually. Obviously, Kazrim was the same too. He presented Galaxy with a bunch of sunflowers and asked her sincerely, \"Are you willing to be my girlfriend?\" Galaxy was pleasantly surprised. She requested him to give her some time to persuade her parents.\nAs she had expected, her parents were very angry after they had learned of their love story. Galaxy explained, \"Kazrim is an excellent and a very optimistic person. He has a very positive attitude towards life and work. He cares for others always. He is 100% better than the normal. Moreover, the mute is still a human. He should possess a perfect and wonderful love. \"\nHer parents asked to see him, then. The very worried Galaxy took Kazrim home a few days later. When they were on the train, Kazrim told her, ''I'm going to tell your parents I'll be looking after you well with all my life!\" Galaxy was deeply moved.\nAs soon as they had entered the house, Galaxy introduced him to her parents. She said, ''This is Kazrim.\" Just right after her speech, an unbelievable thing happened. Kazrim threw the gift away and held her in his arms tightly.\nHe said, \"YOU CAN TALK?\" It was the same question that Galaxy wanted to ask, too.\nThe four people were shocked all of a sudden. As a matter of fact, Kazrim always believed that Galaxy was a mute and he still fell in love with her deeply.", "id": "high555.txt"}
