At one time, only related plants could be crossed with each other.\nBut when GM techniques were developed in the 1970s, scientists were able to put a single gene from a living creature into an unrelated creature.\nThis means they can make crops more productive and resistant to disease by adding genes from other species.They can also create food with special characteristics, such as \"golden rice\", which is enriched with vitamin A. But many people believe GM foods are a health risk.\nAt the moment, the official argument is that GM foods \"are not likely to present risks for human health\". But there are still many questions to be answered as the foods are produced in different ways.\nSome experts believe the genetic material added to plants can transfer to humans and give damage to our bodies. Further harm could be caused by the genes from GM plants crossbreeding with naturally produced crops.\nPeople in China are also getting worried about GM foods. More than 70 percent of the\ncountry's soybean oil is produced from imported GM soybeans. Meanwhile, an investigation last November found that 12 of 60 famous foods sold across the country were GM products. The government has begun to introduce a marking system for GM goods so that people can choose whether or not to eat them.", "id": "high5409.txt"}
