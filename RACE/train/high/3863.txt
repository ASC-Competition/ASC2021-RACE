Some of them have personal relationships with customers.\n''It's a people-relation business,'' Knaust says. ''They really tell me about the stories in the last 15 years. It's something very nice to listen to.

During his early 30s, Knaust already moved to the top in the culinary   field as director of kitchen of Hyatt Regency Cologne in Germany.\nAfter holding several general manager positions in Mandarin Oriental hotels, Knaust joined Hilton International as the general manager to open the Conrad and Doubletree by Hilton at Haitang Bay, Sanya in 2010.\nWhen he was appointed as the general manager of Hilton Shanghai in November, he not only was heavily involved in recruitment, sales and marketing strategies but also he worked closely with the food and beverage team to develop the hotel's restaurant concepts and menus.\n''I believe that we should offer quality and healthy food.'' he says.\nKnaust believes that a hotel must value the customers' comments on Ctrip, Trip Advisor and other platforms, etc.\n''It keeps us more on guard to be 100 percent professional,'' he says.", "id": "high3863.txt"}
