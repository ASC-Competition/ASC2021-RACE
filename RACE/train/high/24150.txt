Yet her brave spirit has survived in her diary. She wrote this diary while hiding from the Nazis during World WarII.\nAnne's father prepared a hiding place for his family. He sealed off several rooms at the back of his office building, and he covered the entrance with a movable bookcase. In July 1942, Anne, her mother and her father, her sister Margot, and four Jewish friends stepped behind the bookcase into the hidden rooms. The Frank family and their friends stayed shut away in secret for over two years. Brave friends risked their lives to bring them food. But constant fear and loss of freedom were hard to bear. For comfort, Anne started to write a diary. She was very good at expressing her thoughts and feelings in words.\nAnne was 13 when she stared to write. Her diary shows that, just like other teenagers, she looked forward to adult life. She hoped to have a career as a writer, and she longed to find love. She had high ideal and wished \"to be useful or give pleasure to people around me.\" Throughout her time in hiding, Anne kept her faith in human nature. She wrote, \"In spite of everything, I still believe that human beings are really good at heart.\"\nIn 1944, the Frank family's hiding place was given away to the Gestapo(German secret police). Anne was sent to the Bergen-Belsen prison camp in Germany. She died at the camp in 1945 at the age of 15.\nOtto, Anne's father, was the only member of the Frank family to survive the war. He published her diary in 1947. Since then it has been published in more than 50 languages. Millions of people have visited the family's hiding place in Amsterdam.
