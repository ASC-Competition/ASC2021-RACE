Although little remains of the property, the team, led by Birmingham Archaeology, believes it has identified a dust hole used by the 16th century poet.\nSmall pieces of pottery   and broken clay pipe have already been found from a muddy hole on the site, which they claim could yield some of the most significant discoveries about Shakespeare in decades. The dig focuses on three areas of the property, which Shakespeare bought in 1597 when he returned to his home town from London having achieved fame -- including the so-called knot garden at the back of the building.\nDr Diana Owen, Director of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which owns the site, said, \"We do not know if the knot garden was an area used by Shakespeare -- it may have been a yard simply used by his servants. But this could actually yield some fantastic results, especially if it was an area where rubbish was thrown or the dust hole was located.\"\nKevin Colls, from Birmingham Archaeology,added, \"Through documentary evidence we know Shakespeare lived at New Place but we have very little information regarding the layout   of the house and gardens at this time. Through archaeological fieldwork, in particular the dig of structural remains and the recovery of artifacts, we hope to fill in the blanks.\"\nUntil October, visitors will be able to watch archaeologists and volunteers at work as they excavate the remains of the house, which was knocked down in 1759. Experts hope to unearth evidence to support theories that Shakespeare wrote many of his most famous works at the property.", "id": "high16004.txt"}
