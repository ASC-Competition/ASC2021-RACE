There was no one he could turn to for advice. His only sister lived away and he hardly ever saw her and when his sister came over, they always ended up in an argument.\nIt had been a hot day and James's clothes seemed to stick to his body. He had felt terrible for weeks and he was just tired of feeling sick. He had started vomiting after he would eat anything and he knew that something would have to be done.\nAfter going to the doctor, he was told to come back in a few days. The next three days had gone by slowly and it was time for his visit to the doctor. He had been shown into the doctor's office and James knew it was bad news. The end result was he had stomach cancer.\nJames sat on the hill looking down at the town and wonder what he would do. Taking out his phone, he dialed his sister's number and told her the bad news. She started to cry and said, \"If anything happens to you, I will be alone in this world.\"\nMarie, his sister said, \"You are moving up here and you will live with me until you get back on your feet, so go home, pack up and I will be there to get you in two days.\"\nHe smiled and said, \" _ sounds wonderful, but I still haven't decided if I am going to have the surgery or not?\" Hearing this, she softly whispered, \"Of course you are having the surgery. I will pick you up in two days. I love you.\"\nJames knew the final word was still up to him and he would think about it because this was a decision that wouldn't come easy to him.", "id": "high7955.txt"}
