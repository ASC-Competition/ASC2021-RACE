The National Development and Reform Commission, the Standardization Administration of China, the Ministry of Agriculture and six other departments announced their 2004-05 development programme for national food standards over the weekend.\nChina is conducting a rectification   within two years. Inspectors will search for all known banned materials in food production. To reduce trading barriers, China will raise the ratio of adopting international standards in the food industry to 55 percent from today's 23 percent. \"Safety is the first consideration for anything entering people's mouth followed by its nutritious value,\" said Hao Yu, secretary-general of the National Food Industry Standardization Technique Committee. He added the usage of food addictives   will be a major field for consideration in setting the new standards. On-the-spot checks during the past two years have shown the abuse   or misuse of addictives in food production and processing has become the biggest threat to food safety. In one case, talcum   powder was found in flour products, which is outlawed according to national food standards.\n\"At present there are no methods or standards to test the content of talcum powder in flour,\" said Shang Yan'e, an official with the national watchdog on grain and oil inspections. Under the guidelines, all banned addictives will be recorded as inspections increase, Relevant departments have allocated   funds to conduct risk evaluations on current food addictives to fix the limits of their usage. China will adopt international advanced techniques and standards so as to find out the harmful materials in food within a shortest period.", "id": "high3701.txt"}
