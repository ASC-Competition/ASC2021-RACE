The junior mountaineer from Big Bear Lake, California has been hooked on climbing from an early age. When he was just 10, he became the youngest person to climb Mt Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak at 5895 meters.\n    Before his 11th birthday, he had another world record under his belt, summiting Europe's Mt Elbrus, in Russia's Caucasus mountains, in July 2007. Five months later, it was the 6962-metre Mt Aconcagua in Argentina, followed by Alaska's Mt McKinley at 6194 meters. In September 2009 at age 13, he climbed Indonesia's Carstensz Pyramid, at 6194 meters the tallest island peak in the world, breaking another record. Eight months later in May 2010, he climbed Everest, and ever since he and his team had been preparing for his Antarctic expedition.\n    \"Looking forward to tomorrow, and we'll make you guys proud and promise we'll come back home safe and sound,\" Romero said in a webcast on Saturday, hours before he began the final ascent to Mt Vinson's summit.\n    The team had intended to reach the top on Christmas Day, but ideal weather and good progress allowed them to summit a day ahead of schedule.", "id": "high23835.txt"}
