Not someone you knew, but a total stranger? It's happened to me a few times, but two instances really stand out.\nA few years ago, I was dining in a restaurant with a friend who kept talking about himself, completely not aware of the fact that I was sitting there in misery. It wasn't my friend's talks that made me suffer. I was recovering from a broken heart, and just sitting down to dinner reminded me of my last relationship. I could have burst into tears right there at the table.\nWhen we picked up the check, the waitress said, \" Your meal was already paid for .\" My friend and I didn't have a clue how it happened. Then I remembered a man I saw out of the corner of my eye. He was dressed in mostly white, sat down at the bar, had a beer, and stayed for maybe ten minutes. The waitress said, \"Yes, the gentleman in white paid for you .\" It felt like an angel was saying \"I see you, honey. It's going to be okay.\"\nJust last year, I was running a half-marathon. With just 1 mile to go, I was out of gas. Runners call it \" _ \". I thought I couldn't move another inch. Out of nowhere, a stranger came up to me and said, \"What's your name, sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!\" And he ran with me until I picked up my pace. I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day.\nI still shake my head when I think of these momentary angels that came to me at my point of need. Do you have any experiences like these?", "id": "high4899.txt"}
