The project is promoted by an environmental protection organisation,which has contributed to improving the living environment for wild animals. Recently, the organisation has issued an appeal to help it observe environmental changes based on the record of butterflies and protect the environment.\nIn the area, the local people have planted many special flowers with the help of the organisation, aiming to see whether these flowers will interest the rare and beautiful butterflies. The Project officer Sarah Marshall says, \"It will be a suitable habitat for butterflies. They are great 'indicator species' as they are easily affected by climate changes so they make a brillian early - warning system for the environment.\" She also points out that volunteers are needed to recourd the number or species of butterflies,and based on the change happening to the butterflies, the hidden environmental problems in the area can be found out in time.\nThe organisation is seeking volunteers to help monitor butterflies from April through to September. They will walk a fixed route and record the different butterflies they encounter along the way.Each visit should take no more than two hours, and each volunteer is expected to visit once a month to count the wildlife. \"Staff will provide back up, so if the weather is poor on the day you are to visit(butterflies don't like to fly in the rain, wind or if it's too cloudy) we can have someone else do your job,\" Sarah points out.\nNo previous experience is necessary as training and support will be provided,but a keen interest is essential.
