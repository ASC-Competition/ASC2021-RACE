Nowadays games on the net are very popular with college students. Some of my roommates are very interested in them. They not only play games in their free time, but also keep talking about them at night when lights are off, and they regard games as part of life. I've begged  them to give it up, but they wouldn't listen to me. It has become a rather big problem. Should I report it to our teachers or do something else?\nTed,\nDear Ted:\nDrop it. Your roommates, as grown-ups, can do whatever they want with their time so long as it doesn't break school rules or violate  other people's interests.\nPlaying perhaps gives these students relaxation  from hard study. If they play too often, have little time to study, and they will _ , but you will not. Reporting to the teachers would only harm your good name in your dormitory . However you have rights to ask your roommates to be quiet when you need sleep. If they aren't angry with you, they will stop talking. But be polite and friendly. Perhaps, in return, join them in a game or two.\nVictor.", "id": "high2116.txt"}
