I felt completely eased,\" said Robert after taking the ride down in one of the tower's lifts, the world's fastest.\nSeveral hundred onlookers and shoppers gathered at the base of the tower watching and cheering Roberts progress through live pictures on a large television screen. At times he disappeared from view as clouds passed by the top of the tower surrounding the upper storeys.\nThe 42-year-old Frenchman has covered scores of well-known structures around the world including the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower-without permission or any safety equipment or ropes.\nThis time Robert was wearing a harness  fastened to safety ropes for the entire climb. He used the ropes to pull himself up most of the way, using his hands and feet to climb up the walls for only short sections. He said the management had requested he wear the ropes and safety equipment, which had also become necessary due to the rain making the windows and frames very slippery. Robert said he would not carry his pity the next time.", "id": "high15932.txt"}
