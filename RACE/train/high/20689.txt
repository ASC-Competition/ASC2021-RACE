The problem is partly their flatness, as with Keds and Vans. However ballet pumps, which have no string or heel, have other specific problems.\n\"As the shoe has no fastening device, it relies on the toes to keep the shoe on, causing an awkward gait ,this leads to short-and long-term problems such as calluses ,heel and knee pain.\"\nWEDGES AND STILETTOS\n     These shoes can also cause problems with gait, They may look good, but the heels on these are so high they can force the wearer's body weight forward, making them very unstable.\nTeens who wear these shoes regularly are also in danger of joining those millions of women with constant back pain.\nSCHOOL SHOES\n     So what do podiatrists have on their wish list, especially for everyday wear?\nSomething in a natural, breathable fabric, with a string to hold it on, with a small heel and a deep toe-box that does not press the toes, such as Clark's, Marks & Spencer or Rhino.\nIf your teen insists on wearing 'bad' shoes, get them some simple foot orthotics in the shoes. These support and correct the movement of the foot and, properly fitted by a podiatrist, can often transform their walk and halt the damage.", "id": "high20689.txt"}
