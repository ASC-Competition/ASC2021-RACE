That's how Ladd Wheeler, psychology professor at the University of Rochester in New York, defines cheating. Many experts believe cheating is on the rise. \"We're suffering a moral breakdown,\" Pinkard says. \"We're seeing more of the kind of person who regards the world as a series of things to be dealt with using any ways available , regardless of morality. Whether to cheat depends on whether it's in the person's interest.\" He does, however, see less cheating among the youngest students. Richard Dienstbier, psychology professor at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, believes that society's attitudes explain much of the increase in cheating. \"Twenty years ago if a person cheated in college, that is extremely serious, he will be dropped for a semester if not kicked out permanently,\" he says. \"Nowadays, at the University of Nebraska, for example, it is the stated policy of the College of Arts and Science that if a student cheats in an exam, the student must receive an \"F\" on what he cheated in. That's nothing. If you're going to fail anyway, why not cheat? Cheating is most likely in situations where the interests are high and the chances of getting caught are low,\" says social psychologist Lynn Kahle of the University of Oregon in Eugene.
