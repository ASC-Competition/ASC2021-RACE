Native Americans are also unable to digest milk.\n  Based on these genetic patterns, scientists have long thought that milk drinking started in Northern Europe, where dairy is an institution and the milk-digesting mutation is everywhere.\n  A recent study painted a different picture.With a computer model, Thomas and colleagues looked at the spread of the milk-drinking mutation, farming and other related factors.Working backward, the scientists concluded that the first milk-drinkers lived in Central Europe around what's now Hungary about 7500 years ago.The practice didn't start farther north, as scientists had thought before.", "id": "high21023.txt"}
