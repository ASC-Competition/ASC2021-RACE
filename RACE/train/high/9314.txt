They took care of their kids without the help of the kid's mothers. At the same time, they also took part in different kinds of activities with their kids together, such as cooking, fishing and selling goods.\nWhy is the show so popular? \"It reflects   social reality.

We can do better than them.\"\n _ also happens in some rural areas in China.
