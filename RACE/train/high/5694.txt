There were no other traffics, so their only hope was to walk.\nBefore they set off, they looked around in the car for useful things to take with them. One of the men took a bottle of whisky. Another took an umbrella. The third unscrewed a door from the car and carried that.\nAfter they had been walking for almost a day, they came across a camel caravan travelling towards them.\n\"Let's try to join the caravan,\" one of the men said. \"It's going the wrong way but we'll be safer than if we keep on alone across the desert.\"\nThe other s agreed, so they asked the leader of the caravan for permission to join it.\n\"You can join the caravan only if you answer three questions,\" he said. He pointed to the first man's bottle. \"What is that and why are you carrying it?\" he asked.\n\"It's a bottle of whisky. I decided to carry it with me so that if I feel miserable and want to give up, I can get drunk, cheer myself up and then keep on walking.\"\n\"Very sensible,\" the leader of the caravan said. Then he pointed to the next man and his umbrella.\n\"It hasn't rained in the desert for many years,\" he said. \"Why are you carrying an umbrella?\"\n\"I don't want to get heat exhaustion,\" he replied. \"The umbrella will give me shade from the sun.\"\n\"Very sensible,\" the leader of the caravan said. He pointed to the third man and his car door. \"And why are you carrying a car door?\" he asked him.\n\"I thought that if I got too hot I could open the window and let some air in,\" he explained.", "id": "high5694.txt"}
