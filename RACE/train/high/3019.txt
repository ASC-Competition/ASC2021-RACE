It was a piece of snakeskin that had been shed    by one of our garden snakes.\n'Isn't it beautiful?\" said my wide-eyed 7~year-old daughter. I stared at the organic wrapper and thought to myself that it really was not that beautiful, but I did not want to disappoint Sarah.  Everything children see for the first time is elementary to their sense of beauty and creativity. They see only merit   and excellence in the world.\n\"Why does it do this?\" Sarah asked. I like to teach my children that there is something else going on besides what they see in front of them. \"Snakes shed their skin because they need to renew themselves,\" I explained.\n\"Why do they need to renew themselves?\" Sarah asked. \"We often need to shed our skins, those coatings that we cover ourselves with,\" I said to my now absorbed daughter. \"We outgrow some things and find other stuff unnecessary. This snake no longer needs this skin.  It is probably too old, and the snake probably doesn't think it looks as smart in the skin as it once did.  Like buying a new suit. \"\nOf course, I'm sure this explanation won't suit naturalists. But Sarah got the point. As we talked, I knew that she began to understand that renewal is part of progress; that we need to take a good look at ourselves, and rooms and schoolwork and creativity, and she began to see what we need to keep and what need to cast off.  I was careful to point out that this is a natural process, not one to be forced.\n\"Snakes don't peel off their skin when they feel like it,\" I explained.  \"lt happens as part of their growth. \"\n\"I see, Dad. \" said Sarah.  She then jumped off my lap, grabbed the snakeskin, and ran off.\nI hoped she would remember this. Often, in order to find our real selves underneath the layers of community and culture we are cloaked   in year after year, we need to start examining these layers. We need to gently peel some away, as we recognize them to be worthless, unnecessary, or flawed  ;  or at best,  remember the things we discard to teach us how we can improve.", "id": "high3019.txt"}
