Technical difficulties. These are some of the typical causes of cancelled trains and planes.

The next train will be arriving on Platform in approximately 36 minutes.\"\nOh, well, another delayed train, thought most passengers. But a couple of them decided to enquire further.

That's got to be a joke,\" said one passenger angrily. \"I wouldn't normally complain if the train is just a bit delayed, but this was unbelievable, \" he added. \"What really made me angry is that this driver refused to get in the train,\" said another passenger. \"He probably went off for a cup of tea after that!\" she added.\nA spokesperson for the rail company apologized for the incident, but said the driver couldn't sit on the damp seat, and wouldn't be able to drive the train standing up.

After landing in Toronto, the 255 passengers crew members were put up in a hotel for the night, then flown on to Frankfurt the following afternoon. \"What a disgusting trip!\" said one tired passenger after the painful experience had ended.\nSo, does your job have the potential to cause such disorder?", "id": "high4958.txt"}
