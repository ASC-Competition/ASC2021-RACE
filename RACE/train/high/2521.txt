Each morning Grandpa was up early to read his Bhagavat Geeta. His grandson wanted to be just like him and tried to imitate him in every way he could.\nOne day the grandson asked, \"Grandpa! I try to read the Bhagavat Geeta just like you but I don't understand it, What good does reading the Bhagavat Geeta do?\"\nThe Grandfather quietly turned from putting coal in the stove and replied, \"Take this coal basket down to the river and bring me back a basket of water.\"\nThe boy did as he was told, but all the water leaked out   before he got back to the house. The grandfather laughed and said, \"You'll have to move a little faster next time,\" and sent him back to the river with the basket to try again. This time the boy ran faster, but again the same took place. He told his grandfather that it was impossible to carry water with a basket.\nThe old man said, \" You're just not trying hard enough,\"  So the boy again dipped the basket into the river and ran hard, but when he reached his grandfather the basket was again empty. he said, \"See Grandpa, it's useless!\"\n\"So you think it is useless?\" The old man said, \"Look at the basket.\"\nThe boy looked at the basket and for the first time realized that the basket was different. It had been transformed from a dirty old coal basket into a clean one inside and outside.\n\"You might not understand or remember everything, but when you read it, you will be changed, inside and out. That is the work of Krishna in our lives.\"", "id": "high2521.txt"}
