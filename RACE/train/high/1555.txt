She stayed at a hotel near the central market. She had seldom been to the city before, and was very excited about what she would find.\nOn the first morning of her visit, as she walked from the hotel to the market, she passed a beggar  . He was holding up a notice, which said, \"Blind from birth. Please give generously .\"Julia felt sorry for the beggar and she bent down and put a dollar coin into his bowl. \"Thank you.\" he said. The same thing happened again the following day. On the third day, however, Julia did not have a dollar coin. She had only fifty cents, so she dropped this into the beggar's bowl. \"What have I done wrong?\" the beggar said, \"Why are you so stingy   today?\"\nJulia was very surprised at the beggar . \"How do you know I haven't given you a dollar?\" she said, \"If you're blind you can't know what coin I put into your bowl.\" \"Ah,\" explained the beggar, \"The truth is that I'm not blind. I'm just looking after this place for the regular beggar while he's on holiday.\" \"On holiday?\" Julia said, \"And what exactly does your blind friend do on holiday?\" \"He goes into the countryside,\" the man said, \"and takes photographs. He's a very good photographer.\"", "id": "high1555.txt"}
