They were examined at the start of the study and again one year later. If kids' mothers expected them to take more risks and be more rebellious,higher chances of risky behavior were seen.\n  _  \n  _  \n  _  \nwhen kids had bad expectations of themselves.\n\"Sometimes parents expect more negative behavior from their children than they should based on the children's history of behavior,\" Buchanan said.Parents shouldn't be naive   about the possibility of bad behavior,she said,but it's also a mistake to think that children who are wellbehaved will naturally become rebellious at the age of 13.\n\"By thinking risktaking or rebelliousness is normal for teenagers and showing that to their children,parents might add to other messages from society that make teenagers feel that they are strange if they are not willing to take risks or break laws,\" she said.\"This can mean,for example,that when parents expect teens to drink before they turn 21 or to do other risky behaviors,kids are less likely to refuse to do so later in their lives.\"\nOn the other hand,parents' expectations that teens can exhibit good behaviors and refuse to behave badly or to take risks could help reduce the possibility of bad behavior,Buchanan said.\"As a parent,you should put expectations on your children carefully.\"", "id": "high15574.txt"}
