In April 1998, he learned he would need a heart operation. It was the kind of news that leads to some serious thinking about life's purpose.\nNot long after the surgery, Tim saw a brochure describing Imagination Library, a program started by Dolly Parton's foundation   that mailed a book every month to children from birth to age five in the singer's home town of Sevier, Tennessee. \"I thought, maybe Linda and I could do something like this when we retire,\"Tim recalls.  He placed the brochure on his desk,\"as a reminder.\"\nFive years later, now retired and with that brochure still on the desk, Tim clicked on imagination library .com. The program had been opened up to partners who could take advantage of book and postage discounts.\nThe quality of the books was of great concern to the Richters. Rather than sign up online, they went to Dollywood for a looksee. \"We didn't want to give the children rubbish,\" says Linda. The books reviewed each year by teachers, literacy specialists and Dollywood board members included classics such as Ezra Jack Keats's The Snowy Day and newer books like Anna Dewdney's Llama Llama series.\nSatisfied, the couple set up the Richter Family Foundation and got to work. Since 2004, they have shipped more than 12,200 books to preschoolers in their area. Megan Williams, a mother of four, is more than appreciative: \"This program introduces us to books I've never heard of .\"\nThe Richters spend about $400 a month sending books to 200 children. \"Some people sit there and wait to die,\" says Tim. \"Others get as busy as they can in the time they have left.\"", "id": "high6708.txt"}
