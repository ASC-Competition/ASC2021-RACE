Words have the power to build us up or tear us down. It doesn't matter if the words come from someone else or ourselves - the positive and negative effects are just as lasting.\nWe all talk to ourselves sometimes. We're usually too embarrassed to admit it, though. But we really shouldn't be, because more and more experts believe talking to ourselves out loud is a healthy habit.\nThis \"self-talk\" helps us motivate ourselves, remember things, solve problems, and calm ourselves down.

The choice is ours. ks5u", "id": "high21661.txt"}
