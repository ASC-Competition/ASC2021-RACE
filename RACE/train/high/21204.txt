Half of parents in Wales are saying\"no\"to after-school activities because they cannot afford them according to a poll for Save the Children.\n       The government said providing free or subsidized leisure activities for children from poorer background is essential to reducing child poverty in the UK. Of those who pay for activities, Save the Children said almost half of parents had to pay more than PS10 per child per week. Many parents were paying more than $20 per week, the survey found.\n       \"What happens after the school gates close at 3:30 pm is just as  _ as what goes on in the school day,\"said Sally Copley at Save the Children. \"Children who do after-school activities have more confidence, see the world in different ways and have a stronger sense of identity . All this finally translates into doing better in exams and getting a better career.\"\n       Half of parents in Wales of 4-to-18-year-olds said their child did some form of sporting activity, the most popular pastime . Other popular choices included drama/dance (26%), Brownies/Scouts (18%)and music lessons(13%). Almost a third of parents said activities they would like their child to take part in were located more than six miles from where they lived.\n       Save the Children said its research highlighted that children from poorer backgrounds did not have the same chances as their better-off friends. Many local governments have offered a wide range of after-young people in their area. The Welsh Assembly Government's community-focused schools programme supports local education authorities to develop a range of out-of-school-hours learning opportunities and childcare for children and young people.", "id": "high21204.txt"}
