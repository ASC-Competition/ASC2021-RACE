The walk to school would be very, very easy. Such _ clothing is one of the products that could be created using \"wearable robotics\" technology.\nDesigned to improve a person's senses and skills, the device could be as simple as a hearing aid. Or it could be a full-body suit that senses what you're going to do, then helps you do it better.\n\"A superman suit would be the final result in wearable robot i cs \",s a id Francois Pin, head of robotics and energy systems at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory , US. While these suits are at least ten years away, in some areas the technology is already in use.\nResearchers are developing artificial- arms and legs that allow old,disabled or injured people to move freely. Thus US Army is interested in using wearable robot legs to help soldiers run faster, carry more equipment and be stronger in battle. Jobs that involve lifting heavy loads or saving lives from the rubble of an earthquake could also become much easier.\nA robot is a device that responds to a command. You're probably with simple robots, such as toy cars or airplanes that respond to buttons you push on a remote control.\nWearable robotics goes further. Instead of just receiving information through a wire or remotecontrol- the robotic device can send information back to its controller.\nSuppose you wore a sleeve that has sensors where your joints are. Every time you move your arm, the sleeve senses your movements and sends the information to a robot, which then moves its arm just as you did. When the robot hits or touches something, it sends a signal back to the sleeve and you sense the action.\nIn this way,scientists are working to wrap the robot around the person. Their goal is to make the sleeve, shoe or suit help you do what you want to do.", "id": "high3070.txt"}
