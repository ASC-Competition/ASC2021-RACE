One Monday morning, I had stopped at New York Hospital when I found _ man dashing down the steps. He was waving to me. I waited until he jumped into the cab. \" LaGuardia Airport, please,\" he said.\nAs always, I wondered about my passenger. \" What do you do?\" \" I am in the neurology department  at the hospital.\" For some unknown reason, I decided to ask for his help.\n\" Could I ask a favor of you?\" He didn't answer. \" I have a son, 16. He's doing well in school. He wants a job this summer. Is there any possibility that you might get him a summer job?\" After a pause, he said, \" The medical students have a research project. Maybe he could fit in. Have him send me his school records.\" He searched his pocket and handed me a card.\nThat evening, I pulled the card from my pocket. \" Robbie,\" I announced proudly, \" this could be a summer job for you. Send him your school records.\" He read it out loud, \" Fred Plum, New York Hospital.\" \" Is this a joke?\" he said in disbelief. After I shouted and threatened  to cut off his pocket-money, Robbie promised to send off his grades the next morning.\nTwo weeks later, when I arrived home, my son handed me a letter from Plum. He was to phone Plum's secretary for an interview.\nRobbie got the job. The white coat he wore made him feel more important than he really was. As high school graduation neared, Plum was kind enough to write letters of recommendation  for universities. To our delight, Robbie was admitted to New York Medical College.\nIt never occurred to me that a stranger should change my son's future.", "id": "high13598.txt"}
