So if your American or English friend asks you to dinner, he usually invites you a week ahead. But if you really have no time and can't go to the dinner, you can ring him to say sorry. The dinner is usually served at home, sometimes at a restaurant. You should get there on time, and don't forget to put on your fine clothes. It is also a good idea to take some little presents to your friend, such as flowers, chocolates and so on. When you are at dinner, you should also observe   some other customs. Here I'll give you some dos and don'ts about them in the following:\n1) Don't leave bones on the table or the floor. (You should put them on your plate with fingers.)\n2) Don't use your bowl to drink soup, but use your spoon to help you instead.\n3) Don't talk with much food in your mouth.\n4) Don't ask others to have more wine. (This is quite different from that in China.)\n5) After dinner, use your napkin   to clean your mouth and hands.\n6) Make sure small pieces of food are not left on your face.\nThen after dinner, you can stay there a little time. And your friend will be pleased if you leave in half an hour or so. Next day, you had better ring him up to thank him for the good dinner.", "id": "high4720.txt"}
