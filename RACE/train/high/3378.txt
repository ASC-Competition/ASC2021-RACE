During the normal dinner chatter  , I noticed that my father was slurring   his words. No one mentioned this during dinner, but I felt compelled to discuss it with my mother afterward.\nWe decided that there was something seriously wrong and that Dad needed to see the doctor.\nMom phoned me two days later. \"The doctor found a brain tumor  . It's too large at this point to operate. Maybe they can do something then, but _ .\"\nEven with the treatment, my father's condition worsened, and the doctor finally informed us that this condition was terminal  . During one of his stays in the hospital, we brought our baby daughter Chelsey with us when we visited him. By this time he had great difficulty speaking. I finally figured out that he wanted Chelsey to sit on his stomach so he could make faces at her.\nWatching the two of them together, I realized I was living an experience that would stay with me forever. Though grateful for the times they could share, I couldn't shake the feeling of a clock ticking in the background.\nOn the visit to my parents' home during what we all know was my father's last days, my mother took Chelsey from my arms and announced, \"Your father would like to see you alone for a minute.\"\nI entered the bedroom where my father lay on a rented hospital bed. He appeared even weaker than the day before.\n\"How are you feeling, Dad?\" I asked. \"Can I do anything for you?\"\nHe tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.\n\"I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,\" I said.\nWith great difficulty he said, \"I love you.\"\nWe don't learn courage from heroes on the evening news. We learn true courage from watching ordinary people rise above hopeless situations. In many ways my father was a strict, uncommunicative man. He found it difficult to show emotion. The bravest thing I ever saw him do was overcome that barrier to open his heart to his son and family at the end of his life.", "id": "high3378.txt"}
