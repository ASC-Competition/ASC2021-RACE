The most stressed children reported incidence of aches or pains of four times a week.\nThe investigation, led by Therese Hesketh, a professor at University College London (UCL) Centre for International Health and Development, pointed the finger at extreme competitiveness in China's education system, from the onset of primary school.\n\"The competitive and punitive educational environment leads to high levels of stress and psychosomatic symptoms,\" the authors say.\n\"Measures to reduce unnecessary stress on children in schools should be introduced urgently.\"\nThe paper appears in Archives of Disease in Childhood, a peer-reviewed journal of the British Medical Association (BMA).\nThe \"urban\" setting for the study was Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, while the \"rural\" setting was a poor county in Quzhou prefecture, in the west of the province.\nThe study highlights some of the complexities that, it says, explain the demands for academic excellence and intolerance of failure.\nOne factor is the country's dramatic rise in prosperity, which has created \"previously unheard-off possibilities for upward mobility\" and in turn stoked pressures on children to do well at school.\nOther reasons are China's one-child policy and the Confucian traditions of respect for parents and elders, filial piety, obedience and discipline.\n\"The aspirations of many parents, who had limited educational opportunities themselves are now invested in their only children,\" it says.\nPrevious studies on school-related stress and its impact on health are few and generally come from Scandinavia.\nA 2008 assessment among 10- to 13-year-old in Sweden found that 21 percent of boys of 30 percent of girls experienced headache, and 17 percent of boys and 28 percent of girls experienced abdominal pain at least once per week.", "id": "high21170.txt"}
