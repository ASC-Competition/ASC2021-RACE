He was a little frightened of driving in the rain or snow, and it was less tiring to sit comfortably in a train and look out of the windows without being worried about how to get to the next place.\nOne of Mr. White's problems was often where to stay when he reached some small places in the country. He did not expect timely and wonderful food, but he found it annoying   when he was given a cold room, and when there was no hot water after a long and tiring journey.\nLater one winter evening, Mr. White arrived at a small railway station. The journey by train that day had not been at all interesting, and Mr. White was cold and tired and hungry. He was looking forward to a simple but satisfying meal by a brightly burning fire, and then a hot bath and a comfortable bed.\nWhile he was walking to the taxi stand, he said to a local man who was also walking there, \"As this is my first visit to this part of the country and I was in too much of a hurry to find out the hotels before I left home, I would very much like to know how many hotels you have here.\"\nThe local man answered,\" We have two.\"\n\"And which of the two would you advise me to go to?\" Mr. White asked then.\nThe local man scratched  his head for a moment and then answered,\"Well, it's like this, whichever one you go to, you'll be sorry you don't go to the other.\"", "id": "high18891.txt"}
