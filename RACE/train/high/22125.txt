Participants preferred time-saving products like three-in-one skincare treatments rather than separate versions after seeing the logos.\nWhen asked whether they would accept a small sum of money immediately or a larger amount in a week's time, they again chose an instant reward after being exposed to the brands. \"Fast food represents a culture of time efficiency   and instant gratification  ,\" said researcher Sanford DeVoe, professor of organizational behavior at Canada's Toronto University. \"It is promoting a general sense of haste whether time is a relevant factor in the context   or not.\"", "id": "high22125.txt"}
