Looking up at the golden red sun ball, she was surprised by its color, deep red in the middle, softly fading into yellow. She could hear nothing but the waves and the seagulls flying up above in the sky.\nThe atmosphere relaxed her. This was what she needed. \"It's getting late,\" she thought, \"I must go home. My parents will be wondering where I am.\" She wondered how her parents would react when she got home after the three days she was missing. She kept on walking, directing herself to bungalow 163, where she spent every summer holiday. The road was deserted. She walked slowly and silently. Just in a few hundred meters, she would have been safe in her house.\nIt was really getting dark now. She wished she had her favorite coat on. It might keep her really warm. She imagined having it with her. This thought dissipated  when she finally saw her front door. It seemed different. Nobody had taken care of the outside garden for a few days. She was shocked: her father was usually so strict about keeping everything clean and tidy, and now...\nShe entered the house. First, she went into the kitchen and saw a note written by her father, \"Dear Ellen, there's some coffee ready; I went looking.\" But where was Ellen? On the right side of the hallway was her parents' room. She went in and saw her. Her mother, lying on the bed, was sleeping. Her face looked so tired, as if she hadn't slept for days. She was really pale. Jennifer would have wanted to wake her up, but she looked too tired. So Jennifer just fell asleep beside her. When Jennifer woke up something was different. She wasn't in her mother's room and she wasn't wearing the old clothes she ran away in. She was in her cozy bed in her pajamas .\nIt felt so good being back home. Suddenly she heard a voice. \"Are you feeling better now, dear?\nYou know you got us very, very scared.\"", "id": "high12554.txt"}
