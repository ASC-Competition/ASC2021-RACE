At the end of each month, you often ask yourself, \"Where has all my money gone\"? To help you better run your salary, here come some money-saving tips.\nFirst, you need to set goals to encourage yourself to save money. For example, you plan to have a good dress in one year, to have a car in two years' time or to buy a house in five years.\nSecond, form money-saving habits and stay away from the ones that waste money. Learn to keep a diary of how much you spend and what it's for. Think twice before using money on expensive skin care products . The best way to keep your skin in good condition is enough sleep.\nThird, pay attention to your daily things. Leave no more than one light on when you leave home. Buy vegetables from a market where vegetables are less expensive and fresher, not a supermarket. When going to a supermarket, take a notebook with you. Write down what you want to buy.\nFourth, save your social life. Take the dishes that haven't been eaten up away for next day when you have dinner in a restaurant. When it's your turn to offer a meal, invite your friends to your home, and cook the dinner yourself. If you are to attend a party and an expensive present is needed, ask several friends to go together to share a present.", "id": "high4772.txt"}
