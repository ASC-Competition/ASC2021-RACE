Royal Stoke University Hospital discovered that its casualty unit  is on the same spot as a Pokemon Go 'gym' ---- where players can train their newly caught Nintendo creatures.\nThe University Hospitals of North Midlands Trust agreed last week that patients can play Pokemon Go on wards because walking around is healthy. But the Trust has been forced to post a warning on its website about public access to A&E. It said if Pokemon Go becomes a major annoyance it would ask Nintendo---- which decides on the locations of the virtual gyms according using GPS----to have it removed from the premises .\nKevin Parker, associate chief nurse, said, \"Members of the public who do not need to be at Royal Stoke should not attempt to enter A&E or any other part of the hospital building to play the game. The A&E department is incredibly busy this summer. We want the public to understand that anybody who visits the hospital solely to play the game will provide an unwanted distraction to the important work of the hospital. I'm also aware of various reports in the media of unsafe areas that the game has been played in.\"\n\"Royal Stoke University Hospital is a safe area where gamers can enjoy Pokemon Go.\" Michelle Harris, the Trust's manager, said the game could still be played by those already in hospital. \"We recognize that the Pokemon Go game encourages walking and exercise, which is something that the Trust is equally keen to promote,\" she said.\nThere are a number of \"walking routes\" established throughout the Trust that can be used to combine walking and playing the game. \"Walking just 30 minutes, five times a week, can help reduce the risk of preventable illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.\"\nThere have been several warnings about the game since its UK release. Last week a group of teenagers in Wiltshire were left stranded almost 100ft underground after they got carried away searching for Pokemon Go characters. The four boys, aged 16 and 17, ended up getting lost and had to wait to get a phone signal before they could call for help. Eventually, they contacted Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue team, who took them to safety. Damien Bence, of the fire and rescue team, said: \"Pokemon Go is obviously leading people into dangerous situations.\"", "id": "high19719.txt"}
