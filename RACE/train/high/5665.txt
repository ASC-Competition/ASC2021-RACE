Organizers called the device the Aspen Time Tube and contributed items like Rubik's cubes  and some iconic music. Jobs added his own items to the capsule ,including the \" Lisa\"  ( also known as an \"Apple\" )\"mouse he used for his presentation at the conference. '\nYounger readers may not recognize the name but the Lisa Apple mouse was one of the first commercial mice released to consumers. The mouse was specially designed for the Apple  Lisa computer. It's also the first personal computer to offer users a graphical user interface \nInitially ,the plan was to dig up the time capsule in the year2000,but organizers forgot its exact location. Recently .they brought in researchers working with the National Geographic Channel show Diggers to find the device. Eventually they came across the 13-foot-long.1. 5-foot-diameter tube. inside they found a lot of 1980s artifacts that are still being catalogued.\n\"When the end came off .literally things just poured out .\"noted Diggers host Tim Saylor \"There must be literally thousands of things in there.\"\n\"They had the foresight to put a bunch of stuff in  plastic bags.\" Saylor said .\"I could see at least a dozen plastic bags and other items. But I know for sure there got to be photographs in there. People had hand-written things on the back of the photographs ,so there will be some really interesting things inside.\"\nAmong the artifacts researchers expect to discover inside :a Steve Jobs speech in which the Apple visionary outlines his predictions  for future technologies. We should know more about the researchers ,discoveries once the Diggers program airs this fall.", "id": "high5665.txt"}
