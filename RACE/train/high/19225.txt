Before this time, they only had two meals a day -- breakfast and dinner.\nIn the 16th century, breakfast was only to break one's fast  . But 200 years later it had became a large meal, not just for family, but for numbers guests as well. It was a social event. It began at 10 a.m. and lasted until 1 p.m. Then breakfast began to be less popular. It became, instead, a lighter meal and was taken at a much earlier hour. By 1850 it had been pushed back to 8 a. m. and became a family meal.\nDinner, however, went to the other way. In the 16th century it was eaten at 11p.m.Years later, it had moved to the early afternoon, then to 5 p. m. By 1850 dinner time had reached 7 p. m. Lunch is a recent idea. It first appeared as a snack to fill the gap between breakfast and dinner.", "id": "high19225.txt"}
