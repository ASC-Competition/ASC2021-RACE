It was common practice for my mother to send me off soul-searching with a proverb.\nOf the many interactions I had with my mother those many years ago, one stands out with clarity. I remember the occasion when Mother sent me to the main road, about twenty yards away from the farmhouse, to invite a passing group of seasonal work-seekers home for a meal. She instructed me to take a container along and collect dry cow dung   for making a fire. I was then to prepare the meal for the group of work-seekers.\nThe thought of making an open fire outside at midday, cooking in a large three-legged pot in that high heat, was enough to upset even an angel. I did not manage to hide my feelings from my mother, and after serving the group, she called me to the balcony, where she usually sat to attend to her sewing  .\nLooking straight into my eyes, she said, \"Tsholofelo, why were you so unhappy when I requested you to prepare a meal for those poor people?\" Despite my attempt to deny her allegation  , and using the heat of the fire and the sun as an excuse for my alleged behavior, Mother, giving me a firm look, said, \"A foot has no nose.\" It means, \"You can't detect what trouble may lie ahead of you.\" Had I denied the group of people a meal, it may have happened that, in my travels some time in the future, I found myself at the mercy of those very individuals. As if that was not enough to shame me, Mother continued, \"A person is a person because of another person.\"", "id": "high15070.txt"}
