Without advertisements, there would not be these private \nbusinesses. \nHave you ever asked yourself what advertising is? Through the years, people have given different \nanswers to the question. For some time it was felt that advertising was a means of \"keeping your name \nbefore the public.\" And some people thought that advertising was \"truth well told.\" Now more and more \npeople describe it in this way: Advertising is the paid, non-personal, and usually persuasive description of \ngoods, services and ideas by identified sponsors  through various media. \nFirst, advertising is usually paid for. Various sponsors pay for the advertisements we see, read, and \nhear over the various media. Second, advertising is non-personal. It is not face to face communication. \nAlthough you may feel that a message in a certain advertisement is aimed directly at you, in reality, it is \ndirected at large groups of people. Third, advertising is usually persuasive. Directly or indirectly it tells \npeople to do something. All advertisements try to make people believe that the product, idea, or service \nadvertised can do good to them. Fourth, the sponsor of the advertisement must be identified. From the \nadvertisement, we can see if the sponsor is a company, or an organization, or an individual. Fifth, \nadvertising reaches us through traditional and nontraditional mass media. Included in the traditional \nmedia are newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and films. Nontraditional media include the mail, \nmatchbox covers, and billboards.", "id": "high21150.txt"}
