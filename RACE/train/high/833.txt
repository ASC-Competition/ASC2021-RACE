But makers Choc Edge have missed the Easter rush. Even so, they hope the printer will be snapped up by retailers   immediately they come to the market. Britain's biggest chocolatiers Thornton's have already said they are interested. Because of the high cost, however, few individuals are likely to buy one. But the devicecould one day allow people to design their own 3D objects after submitting their designs on a website. Dr Hao, founder of Choc Edge came up with a prototype   last year and has only just perfected it so that it can now go on sale. \"We've improved and simplified the machine, so now it is really easy to use,\" he told the BBC. \"You just need to melt some chocolate, fill a syringe   that is stored in the printer, and get creative printing of your chocolate.\"\n3D printing is a technology where a three dimensional object is created by building up successive layers of material. The technology is already used in industry to produce plastic and metal products, but this is the first time the principles have been applied to chocolate. The research has presented many challenges. Chocolate is not an easy material to work with because it requires accurate heating and cooling cycles. Dr Hao said, \"What makes this technology special is that users will be able to design and make their own products. From reproducing the shape of a child's favourite toy to a friend's face, the possibilities are endless. It could be developed to help consumers design many products from different materials, but we've started with chocolate as it is easily available, low cost and harmless.\" \"There is also no wastage as any spoilage   can be eaten.\" Dr Hao added, \"Eventually we may see many mass-produced products replaced by unique designs created by the customer.\"[:]\nEPSRC chief executive Professor Dave Delpy said, \"This is a good example of how creative research can be applied to create new manufacturing and retail ideas. By combining developments in engineering with the commercial potential of the digital economy,We can see the new market prospect  --creating new jobs and, in this case, the chocolate printer is called sweet business opportunities.\"", "id": "high833.txt"}
