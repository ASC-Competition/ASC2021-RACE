The importance of rare earths has only grown as emerging markets increase their demand for technologies made with it, as does the renewable energy industry.\nThe 17 metallic elements are common in the earth-s crust, but the technique used to extract and refine them is labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous and increasingly costly.  Thomas Gradael,  a professor of geology and geophysics at the Yale School of Forestry Environmental Studies, explains that thecriticality\" of rare earths was only recently understood after China, which dominates the world-s supply of the minerals, cut exports by 40% in 2010, citing concerns over how polluting the rare earth industry was.\nAlong with colleagues at Yale, Gradael decided to investigate the metals used in modern technologies to determine if there were viable  substitutes.\"Twenty or thirty years ago electronics were being made with 11 different elements,\" explains Gradael.  \"Today's computers and smartphones use something like 63 different elements.\" Their findings showed that there were no \"readily apparent\" substitutes for a metal that would not compromise on quality or performance.\nHowever increased mining for these scarce resources can have some nasty side effects for the environment. China, which has intensively mined for rare earths with little regulation, allowing it to dominate the global industry since 1990, has acknowledged the incredible environmental harm caused by the process.  \"Excessive rare earth mining has resulted in landslides, clogged rivers, environmental pollution emergencies and even major accidents and disasters, causing great damage to people's safety and health and the ecological environment,\" read a white paper issued by the Chinese cabinet in June last year.\nRecycling metal has been advocated by some as a possible way of managing these precious resources-the European Parliament adopted a law curbing dumping of electric waste in 2012. But Gradael says that for rare earths, recycling will have little impact.", "id": "high9588.txt"}
