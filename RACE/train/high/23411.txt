College, career, and life itself got in the way. In fact, Jack moved clear across the country in pursuit of his dreams. There, in the rush of his busy life, Jack had little time to think about the past and often no time to spend with his wife and son. He was working on his future, and nothing could stop him.\n         One day, over the phone, his mother told him that Mr. Belser died the night before and the funeral would be on Wednesday.\n         \"Oh, it's been so long since I thought of him. I'm sorry, but I honestly thought he died years ago,\" Jack said.\n         \"Well, he didn't forget you. Every time I saw him he'd ask how you were doing. He'd recall about the many days you spent over 'his side of the fence' as he put it,\" Mom told him.\n         \"I love that old house he lived in. He's the one who taught me carpentry. I wouldn't be in this business if it weren't for him. He spent a lot of time teaching me things he thought were important... Mom, I'll be there for the funeral,\" Jack said.\n         Busy as he was, he kept his word. Mr. Belser's funeral was small and uneventful. He had no children of his own, and most of his  s had passed away.\n         The night before he had to return home, Jack and his Mom stopped by to see the old house next door one more time, which was exactly as he remembered. Suddenly Jack stopped.\n   \"The box is gone,\" he said.\n   \"What box?\" Mom asked.\n\"There was a small gold box that he kept locked on top of his desk. I must have asked him a thousand times what was inside. All he'd ever tell me was 'the thing I value most'\", Jack said.\n         \"Now, I'll never know what was so valuable to him,\" Jack said sadly.\n         Returning to his office the next day, he found a package from Mr. Harold Belser on his desk. Jack tore open the package. There inside was the gold box and an envelope. \"Upon my death, please forward this box and its contents to Jack Bennett. It's the thing I valued most in my life.\" A small key was taped to the letter. His heart racing, and tears filling his eyes, Jack carefully unlocked the box. There inside he found a beautiful gold pocket watch. Running his fingers slowly over the fine cover, he opened it.\n         Inside he found these words carved: \"Jack, thanks for your time! Harold Belser.\"\n\"Oh, My God! This is the thing he valued most...\"\n    Jack held the watch for a few minutes, then called his assistant and cleared his appointments for the next two days. \"Why?\" his assistant asked. \n    \"I need some time to spend with my son,\" he said.", "id": "high23411.txt"}
