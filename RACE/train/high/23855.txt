And Chile's capital, Santiago, moved about 11 inches to the west-southwest. The cities of Valparaiso and Mendoza, Argentina, northeast of Concepcion, also moved.\nThe quake's epicenter  was in a region of South America that's part of the so-called \"ring of fire,\" an area of major seismic  stresses which encircles(,) the Pacific Ocean. All along this line, the plates on which the continents move press against each other.\nMike Bevis, professor of earth sciences at Ohio State, has led a project since 1993 that has been measuring crustal movement in the Central and Southern Andes. The effort is called the Central and Southern Andes GPS Project, or CAP.\nBen Brooks, an associate researcher with the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii, said that the event, offers a unique opportunity to better understand the seismic processes that control earthquakes.\n\"We now have modern, precise instruments to evaluate this event, and because the site borders a continent, we will be able to get evidences of the changes it caused.\" said Brooks.", "id": "high23855.txt"}
