We may become jealous of a best friend's top marks in an exam, or of the girl in art class who is praised by the teacher all the time. We get annoyed because these good things are happening to someone else but not to us.\n   It's bad to feel jealous. We should be pleased with the things we have.

We see that other people have styles and talents different from our own. By comparing ourselves with others, we can know what we lack.
