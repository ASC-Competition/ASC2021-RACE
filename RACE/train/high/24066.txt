A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves, based on the day's efforts.  \nThe design was inspired by a desire to combat the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, said Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London. \" We looked at current issues and childhood obesity really stood out,\" she told New Scientist. \"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.  \nOnce a child has used up their daily  _ gained through exercise, the television automatically switches off.
