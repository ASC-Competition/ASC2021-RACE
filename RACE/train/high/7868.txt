My head was full of problems, burdens and confusion. I decided to take a walk even though I didn't know where I would go.\nThe most extraordinary thing happened when I was on this walk.\nI saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least seventy years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me.\nThen, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, \"Grandfather, may I polish your shoes?\" That old man took pity on her and he gave her a shoe to polish.\nThe girl said, \"I polish the shoe because I need money to buy my brother a new school uniform.\"\nI heard this and tears came to my eyes. The old man answered, \"Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a school uniform.\" Then they walked to a market and I followed them behind. There he bought her a school uniform.\nThe girl said, \"Thank you so much for doing this. May God bless you.\" Then she left, leaving the old man smiling.\nHe walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, \"You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!\" As I walked away, I glanced back and I could see him still smiling.\nMy own sadness disappeared and was chased away   by the light of this kind act. I began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation of what I have by following the example of the old man who only had a little, but shared it beautifully with someone who had nothing.", "id": "high7868.txt"}
