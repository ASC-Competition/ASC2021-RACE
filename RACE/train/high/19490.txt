Some live in the treetops. Many of these animals are not only expert climbers, but they also have found interesting ways to get from tree to tree.\n   How Do Animals Adapt?andHow Do Animals Move? are comprehensive explorations of animal adaptations and movement for young readers. Both are part of a 21 book series,The Science of Living Things.\n   InHow Do Animals Adapt?readers learn how animals adapt to survive with respect not only to climate, darkness, food and defenses but also to offspring and people. These adaptations are well explained in double page spreads   with examples clearly depicted   in photographs and diagrams and developed through their accompanying captions  .\n   As the title suggests, movement is the focus ofHow Do Animals Move?Beginning with a description of the explanation of movement, the reader is exposed to the many different ways of animals movement in the air, on land, under ground and in the water. Several unconventional   variations (e.g. looping of inchworms, the rectilinear motion of snakes) are included. Once again, the photographs and diagrams plainly support the double page spread discussions of animal movement.\n   The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without talking down to them. In both books, terminology   is featured in  . Some of these words are explained in the basic glossary while the majority are explained clearly in the text. Many of these terms provide readers with some fascinating, uncommon words (e.g. brachiation, potassium, skein, and estimate). As do many of Kalman's book, both of these titles have a table of contents, glossary and index   which are all enough to introduce young readers to the nature of these tools.\n   Both titles would make excellent additions to any science collection for young readers.", "id": "high19490.txt"}
