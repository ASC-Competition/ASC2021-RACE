He asked his mother for permission and she agreed. Walking down his block he saw many stores.Stopping at a music store he saw a very pretty girl of his own age.\nHe walked up to the counter.She smiled at him and asked, \"Can I help you with anything?\" The guy could only think that it was the most beautiful smile he had ever seen and stuttered  , \"'Well, I'd like to buy a CD.\" He grabbed the first one he saw.\"Do you want me to wrap it?\" the girl asked. The guy said yes and then took the wrapped CD home.\nFrom that day on he visited the music store every day, and each day he bought a CD, and each day the girl wrapped it up and the guy stored it unopened in his closet.\nHe was too shy to find the nerve to ask the girl out.His mother noticed this and encouraged him.\nThe next day the guy set out for the store with a determined mind. He bought a CD and the girl wrapped it as usual.While she was busy , he left his telephone number on the counter and rushed out of the store.\nThe following day the guy didn't visit the store.When the girl called him, his mother answered the phone and started crying.The girl asked her what was the matter.\"He died yesterday,\" the mother said. There was a long silence.\nLater that afternoon the guy' s mother entered his room and opened his closet.To her surprise, she saw a big pile of unopened CDs wrapped in festive paper.With curiosity she tore open the package and noticed a slip of paper \"Hi! You're cute; I would love to meet you.Let's go out some time.Sophie.\"\nThe mother started crying as she opened another, and another.Every single CD contained a slip of paper that said the same.\nThat's the way life is.Don't wait to show those special people the way you feel.Tomorrow would be too late.", "id": "high21337.txt"}
