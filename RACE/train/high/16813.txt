Long-term effects include obesity,insulin resistance, and heart disease. A survey by the National Sleep Foundation reports that we're losing one hour of sleep each night----more than two full weeks of sleep every year.\nThe good news is that,like all debt, with some work,sleep debt can be repaid. Adding an extra hour or two of sleep a night is the way to catch up.For the long--term lack of sleep,take it easy for a few months to get back into a natural sleep pattern.\nGo to bed when you are tired,and allow your body to wake you in the morning(no alarm clock allowed).You may find yourself catatonic in the beginning of the recovery cycle:expect to have ten hours shut-eye per night. As the days pass, however,the amount of sleeping time will gradually decrease.\nSo earn back that lost sleep----and follow the dictates of your innate sleep needs. You'll feel better.\"When you put away sleep debt, you become a superman,\"says Stanford's Dement, talking about the improved mental and physical capabilities that come with being well rested.", "id": "high16813.txt"}
