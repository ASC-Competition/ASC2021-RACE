He was a good piano player and always performed in this bar. People came in just to hear him play. But one night, a customer told him that he didn't want to hear him just play the piano any more. He wanted him to sing a song.\nThe man said, \"I don't sing.\"\nBut the customer was persistent . He told the bar manager, \"I'm tired of listening to the piano. I want that man to sing!\"\nThe manager shouted across the room, \"If you want to get paid, sing a song. Our customers are asking you to sing!\"\nSo he did. He sang a song. A piano player who had never sung in public did so for the first time. And everyone was surprised by his song \"Mona Lisa\". He got lots of applause that night.\nHe had such a talent for singing, but _ for the past years! If without such a chance, he may have lived the rest of his life as a no-name piano player in a no-name bar. However, now he has become one of the best-known singers in America.\nYou, too, have skills and abilities. Maybe your \"talent\" is not as great as the singer above, but it may be better than you think! And with effort, most skills can be improved. So, in your life, you should be brave enough to try doing different things and find out what talents you really have!", "id": "high14797.txt"}
