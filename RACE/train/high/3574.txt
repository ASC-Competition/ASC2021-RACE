Others have unusual orbits which cause vast temperature variations, making it impossible for water to exist - the most important thing for life.\nDr Smith said, \"We have found that most other planets and solar systems are wildly different from our own. It means it is highly unlikely there are any planets with intelligent life close enough for us to make contact.\" But his suggestions contradict other leading scientists who have claimed aliens almost certainly exist.\nOnly last month Professor Stephen Hawking said the fact that there are billions of galaxies out there made it reasonable to think there were other life-forms in the universe.\nResearchers from the University of London have recently suggested that aliens could be living on as many as 40,000 other planets. But Dr Smith said: \"Any hope of contact has to be limited to a relatively tiny space around the Earth, reaching maybe 1,250 light years out from our planet, where aliens might be able to pick up our signals or send us their own. But communicating would still take decades or centuries.\"", "id": "high3574.txt"}
