A giant spider web was recently found there. The thick web is swarming   with millions of little spiders.\nStretching across several acres it blankets a number of trees, bushes and even the ground.\nWhile the web may make some people nervous, it has become a big attraction for others-especially for unlucky insects. \"At first, it was so white that it looked like fairyland,\" said Donna Garde, the park's manager. \"Now it's filled with so many mosquitoes that it's turned a little brown.\"\nMost spiders work alone, which is why the discovery of the huge web has caused such a stir. Scientists across the country have been debating its origin.\nSome spider experts' say the monstrous web may have been weaved by social spiders. Social spiders work together to build larger webs to catch small insects. However, those webs take years to build. Park officials say this web was formed in just a few months. \nOthers say it could be the work of millions of tiny ballooning spiders. These types of spiders 'fly' by throwing out thin threads of silk, which they use to ride air currents  . In 2002, a similar giant web made by ballooning spiders was discovered in a field in Canada.\nTexas entomologist   Herbert Pase says the giant web is very unusual. \"From what I'm hearing, it could be a once-in-a-life-time event,\" he said.\nBut John Jackman, an entomologist and professor at Texas A&M University, disagrees. Jackman says he hears reports of similar webs, like the one in Canada, every few years. \"There are a lot of folks that don't realize spiders do that,\" he said. \"Until we get some samples sent to us, we won't know what species of spider we're talking about.\"\nPark officials expect the web to last until fall when the weather gets cooler. That's when the spiders begin dying off in the park.", "id": "high18098.txt"}
