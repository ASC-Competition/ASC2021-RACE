They are violating labour's rights. The government must immediately bring the guilty to justice. A stricter government inspection system must be enforced to protect the workers.\nNathan 2007-03-28 21:39\nIt is known that McDonald's and KFC and other fast-food restaurants pay the lowest wage they possibly can to get their employees. I think it's kind of funny that these two restaurants have not yet set up unions. It is also known that _ also take every possible measure e(legal, and sometimes illegal) to prevent their employees from forming or joining unions. I think it is high time that government enforced the law that they have made.\nCushman 2007-03-28 22:32\nThe deepest reason is that China has a large population. If you complain that the pay is very low, the boss will tell you that can go to other places and that there are a lot of people waiting for the job. Today finding a job is not very easy, so you don't have many choices, and you have to face the reality.\nChip 2007-03-29 20:33\nIf wages were too low, people wouldn't work for them, but they do, so it proves the wages are reasonable. Sure, they could raise the wages, but why should they? The workers are still working, still willing to show up on time, and it keeps costs lower. Were they to raise wages, they would have to FIRE more workers, and the price of burgers would go up. Then people wouldn't buy them, then McDonald's would once again FIRE more workers because of a reduced demand, and you'd be back in the same boat, just with less people working.", "id": "high7479.txt"}
