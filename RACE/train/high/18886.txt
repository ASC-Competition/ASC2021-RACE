One early spring day, however, I was brought to see the Caliph. He said, \"Sindbad, I have chosen you to deliver a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib in return for his message of friendship.\"\nThe Caliph's commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt .\n\"Your Majesty,\" I answered, \"I am ready to do all that your Majesty commands, but I have made a promise never again to leave Baghdad.\"\n\"I admit,\" said he, \"that you have indeed had some extraordinary experiences, but I do not see why they should prevent you from doing as I wish. You have only to go straight to Serendib and give my message, and come back as you will.\"\nAt last, I agreed. The Caliph was delighted and gave me a thousand sequins (gold coins) for the expenses of the voyage. Soon I sailed quickly and safely to Serendib after a nearly 30-day voyage where I was well received, and brought into the presence of the king.\nI displayed the Caliph's gifts: a bed which cost a thousand sequins, and more beds of different fashion. The King received the assurance of the Caliph's friendliness with satisfaction. Since my task was accomplished, I was anxious to depart. The king dismissed me with many presents, and I left immediately on the end day of May. On the fifth day we suffered from pirates  who killed some of us and made the rest prisoners of whom I was one. On a distant island they sold us for slaves. I fell into the hands of a rich merchant.\nThe merchant asked me to shoot elephants in the forest. When he left, he said, \"When you have succeeded in killing one come and tell me.\"\nSo saying, he gave me a supply of food and returned to the town. I settled myself in the tree and kept watching. The next morning I saw a large group of elephants passing by. I shot one to death and run back to tell my master of my success, for which I was praised and regaled(,) with good things. Then we went back to bury the elephant I had killed, in order that when it became a skeleton my master might return and keep its tusks safely.\nI hunted for two months. One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants which paused instead of passing the tree, trumpeting(,) horribly. I was terrified. The largest of the animals brought me to the ground .I thought now that my last hour was surely come; but the huge creature, picking me up gently enough; set me upon its back, then turned into the forest. After what seemed a long time to me, I was standing on a great hill where there was filled with bones and tusks of elephants which are more than I could carry away in a lifetime.\nI run to my master's house, and was received by him with joyful surprise. He asked me what had happened to me and why I was still alive. I soon satisfied his curiosity, and the next day we went together to the Ivory Hill, and he was overjoyed to find as many tusks.\nHe said, \"My brother, these wild elephants have killed numbers of our slaves every year. You alone have escaped; therefore you must be under the special protection of Heaven. You deserve your liberty, and I will give you a fortune.\"\nI only asked liberty to return to my own country\n\"Well,\" he answered, \"the monsoon will soon bring the ivory ships here, and then I will send you on your way.\"\nSo I stayed with him till the time of the monsoon. When the ships at last arrived, my master put on board for me a great store of supply, also lots of ivory, and said me goodbye. I left without feeling at ease upon the sea after what had happened. I sold my ivory and bought many expensive presents. I joined a traveling team of merchants. Our journey was long and boring, but gradually, I did not to fear storms, or pirates, or any of the other dangers. When the fall wind came blowing, we reached Baghdad. \nI brought myself to the Caliph and told him everything about my experience. My story was written in letters of gold, and laid up among his treasures. I took my leave of him, well satisfied with the honors and rewards he gave me; and since that time I have rested from my labors, and given myself up wholly to my family and my friends.", "id": "high18886.txt"}
