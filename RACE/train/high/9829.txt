Because it was only a seed, nobody noticed it. Thus, feeling inferior  , the seed gave no importance to his existence. Then one day, a wind picked him up and threw him on an open field in the sun. Later, he was given rain. Years later he saw a traveler sitting by his side. \"Thank you God for this. I really needed some rest,\" he heard the traveler say. \"What are you talking about?\" the seed quickly asked. He thought the man was making fun of him. No one ever spoke to him like that. \"Who just spoke?\" the shocked man asked. \"It is me, a seed.\" \"A seed?\" the man looked at the big tree. \"Are you joking? You are no seed. You are a big tree!\" \"Really?\" \"Yes! Why else do you think people come here?\" \"What do they come here for?\" \"To feel your shade  ! Don't tell me you didn't know you had grown over time. \"A moment passed. The seed thought and smiled for the first time in his life. The years of torture   by the sun and the rain finally helped him grow up. \"Oh! That means I'm not a little seed anymore! I was actually born to make people feel comfortable. Wow! That's great! \"", "id": "high9829.txt"}
