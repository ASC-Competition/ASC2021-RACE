Torres is as determined and driven in her daily life as she is in the pool. She is dedicated to pursuing her passions and following her dreams-something she hopes to instill in her 2-year-old daughter and women and girls everywhere.

I think about the end and about my feelings of success, and that keeps me going. I definitely set goals for myself and try not to get too distracted trying to reach them. And always remember to have fun !\n              Any strategies or tips for overcoming mental obstacles to be your very best?\n              Mental obstacles are tough. For my personally, if I was having mental obstacles, I would talk to my coach, who was the most important person to me during this comeback. It's so important to have that person in your life, a trusted advisor. Communication is very important, and I've learned it's OK to turn to others if you're having a tough time. When I was younger, I would internalize(...) things. Not any more. It's a great relief to be able to share.", "id": "high17573.txt"}
