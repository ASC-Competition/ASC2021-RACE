What scientists do agree on is that the temperature will continue to increase if measures are not taken to reduce pollution and emission   from cars and factories.\nIt is widely agreed that oil and coal create greenhouse gases when they are burned to produce heat or power. These emissions include carbon dioxide, which is the cause of most of the global warming problem. The loss of the trees in many areas is making the problem worse, because trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. The fewer trees that are left standing, the less carbon dioxide can be absorbed.\nScientists predict that the sea level will rise, ice caps   will melt, and some animals and plants will fail to survive because their habitat will disappear. There may be more deserts and less available farmland because of the dry ground, and there may be more storms and floods in many countries.\nSome countries, including the UK and the US, are taking steps to prevent the situation from becoming worse. There are programmes to educate citizens and students about the situation and recycling waste is becoming more common. New guidelines are being introduced to try to limit greenhouse gases from being produced by factories and businesses. Using more alternative energy sources is also a good way to prevent global warming.\nOne thing that everyone can do is limit their use of energy every day, and you can do this no matter how old or young you are. Try to limit the unnecessary use of electricity and work to conserve energy every day.", "id": "high23043.txt"}
