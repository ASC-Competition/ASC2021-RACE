The latest research shows that the reason could be that men's hearts go into rapid decline  when they reach middle age.\nThe largest study of the effects of aging on the heart has found that women's longevity may be linked to the fact that their hearts do not lose their pumping power with age.\n\"We have found that the power of the male heart falls by 20-25 percent between 18 and 70 years of age,\"  \"Within the heart there are millions of cells that enable it to beat. Between the ages of 20 and 70 , one-third of those cells die and are not replaced in men,\" .\nWhat surprises scientists is that the female heart sees very little loss of these cells.  \"This gender difference might just explain why women live longer than men,\" said Goldspink.\nThe team has yet to find why aging takes a greater toll  on the male heart, said Goldspink..\nThe good news is that men can improve the health of their heart with regular exercise.", "id": "high21200.txt"}
