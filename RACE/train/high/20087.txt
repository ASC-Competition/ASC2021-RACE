He said at a press conference the world's cities consume 75 percent of the world's energy and produce 80 percent of the emissions which cause climate change. \"The problem of our planet is an urban problem,\" Johnson said.\n    He said the British capital wants to use the Olympics \"to drive the greening and the improvement of our city\" and noted that London is committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 percent by 2025.\n    Johnson said the key measure was being taken to solve problems relating to housing and commercial buildings, which accounted for 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in London. This involved retrofitting  -- installing lagging -- in large numbers of public buildings.\n    Johnson proclaimed himself a \"passionate cyclist\" and said he would push ahead with cycle superhighways around London.\n    London's air quality problem, he said, was caused by vehicle emissions from 8,300 worn and used diesel  buses, which could be replaced by low-carbon vehicles. In addition, there were also 32,000 taxis running on diesel fuel, which could be replaced by electric vehicles.\n    Johnson said there would be a few programs in the next few years to produce a \"cleaner, greener\" bus for the city. \"The age of the diesel bus has got to be over in London.\"", "id": "high20087.txt"}
