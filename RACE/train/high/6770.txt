This should help DHL, a division of the German postal service, reach its target of improving the company's carbon efficiency by 30 percent before 2020.\n\"As the world's biggest logistics  provider, we recognize a special responsibility to reduce the impact on the environment as much as possible,\" said Frank Appel, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche Post DHL, in a statement referring to a variety of measures being considered.\nThe \"fetch friends\" find out online about parcels that need delivering to people who live or work along the way that they are planning to travel through the city. They then select the ones that they want to take.\nCodes  sent to their mobile phones tell the volunteers where to pick the packages up. Parcels can be taken part of the way or passed on to another volunteer but all volunteers need to have the right code on their mobile phone so the track and trace system can be updated.\nLogistics companies will be responsible for looking after the operation to make sure that the privacy of post is respected.\nIt's hoped that this could be done using mobile phones but DHL says it recognizes that some security issues remain to be worked out.", "id": "high6770.txt"}
