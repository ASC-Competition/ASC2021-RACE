I sang everything,\" Gloria said. \"Cubans,\" she added, \"are a musical people\".\nGloria was born in Cuba in 1957. Her family left the country just before Fidel Castro came to power. In Miami, where the family settled, many people did not accept Cuban immigrants. In first grade, she spoke little English, but she worked hard to learn the language. Six months after she entered school, she won an award for reading in English!\nWhen Gloria was ten, her father returned from the Vietnam War. Soon, the family realized he wasn't well. They soon found out that he was badly ill. Her mother went back to teaching at school to support the family. Gloria cared for her father and her younger sister.\nShe still made the honor roll, and she still had her music, but Gloria was lonely. However, when the band leader Emilio Estefan came to speak at her high school, Gloria sang for him. He asked her to join his band. It was the beginning of the Miami Sound Machine.\nWithin a few months, the Miami Sound Machine was the top band in Miami. In 1978 Gloria and Emilio married.\nAt first, the Miami Sound Machine was known only in Miami. Then the band signed with CBS Records. Estefan and his band became stars.\nSince then, the Miami Sound Machine has sold millions of records. Gloria has done more than just singing when Hurricane Andrew hit central Florida in 1992. She used only two weeks to organize an all-star concert that raised $2 million for the people who suffered in the hurricane. \"We needed a party after that _ ,\" she said.\nGloria said, \"You have to stay true to the music you really love to do. There will always be people who will tell you, 'that won't work.' You've got to be firm in spite of difficulties. Stick to it--that's the main thing.\"", "id": "high2470.txt"}
