Instead, they feed documents humans have already translated into two languages and then rely on computers to decide patterns for future translations.\nThough the quality is not perfect, it is an improvement on previous efforts at machine translation, said Franz Och, 35, a German who heads Google's translation effort at its Mountain View headquarters south of San Francisco. \"Some people who have been in machine translations for a long time see our Arabic-English output, and then they say, that's amazing; that's a breakthrough .\" Said Och. \"And then other people who have never seen what machine translation was read through the sentence and they say, the first mistake here in Line Five-it doesn't seem to work because there is a mistake there.\"\nBut for some tasks, a mostly correct translation may be good enough. Speaking over lunch this week in a Google cafeteria famed for offering free, healthy food, Och showed a translation of an Arabic Web news site into easily digestible English.\nTwo Google workers speaking Russian at a nearby table said, however, that a translation of a news site from English into their native tongue was understandable but a bit awkward. Och, who speaks German, English and some Italian, feeds hundreds of millions of words from parallel texts such as Arabic and English into the computer, using United Nations and European Union documents as key sources.\nLanguages without considerable translated texts, such as some African languages, face greater obstacles. \"The more data we feed into the system, the better it gets.\" said Och, who moved to the United States from Germany in 2002.\nThe program applies statistical analysis, an approach he hopes will avoid diplomatic embarrassing mistakes in diplomatic situations, such as when Russian leader Putin's translator annoyed then German Chancellor  Gerhard Schroeder by calling him the German \"Fuhrer (\"leader\" in English),\" which is forbidden in that context because of its association with Adolf Hitler.\n\"I would hope that the language model would say, well, Schroeder is...very rare but Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schroeder is probably 100 times more frequent than Fuhrer and then it would make the right decision.\" Och said.", "id": "high21389.txt"}
