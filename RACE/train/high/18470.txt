Other creature comforts , such as soap, hot showers, and running water, are also \" unsettling\" the youngster. Known only as Ray, and believed to be around 17, the boy is thought to have spent at least five years sleeping rough in woods south of the German capital.\n   He handed himself into officials on September 5, and was carrying a rucksack ,tent and sleeping bag. He told police his father had recently died after a fall and he had buried him in a shallow grave. He then walked north for a fortnight for help until he got to the German capital.\n   Despite the bizarre nature of the story, police have said it is credible. The source said it was \" unsurprising\" the teenager found a soft bed so unusual if he had been sleeping rough for so long. \"He has indicated that he would be far more comfortable on the forest floor and would prefer to return there to sleep,\" the source added.\n   The boy claimed that his father had taken him into the woods south of Berlin after his mother, Doreen, died in a car crash.\n   Now detectives have begun a search for the grave, or any other place where Ryan's body might be lying. The boy is unable to tell them exactly where he buried his father, but claimed he \" followed his compass northwards\". In the meantime, they are trying to make Ray a ward of court, so that an official can be appointed to make important decisions on his behalf.\n   DNA, fingerprint and dental records can also then be handed to Interpol  so that his records can be checked against those of missing children. A police spokesman confirmed that a search had started for Ryan's grave after the boy said that he was buried under the stones \" two weeks south of Berlin\". Police are puzzled by the case, but say that everything Ray has told them so far adds up.\n   Officials believe the teenager could be British because he speaks English but only basic German. The British Consul is also working with police to try to solve the mystery. \n   Ray, who is 5 feet 11 inches, with blond hair, is in good physical shape and had no signs of abuse apart from a small scar that was at least 3 years old.", "id": "high18470.txt"}
