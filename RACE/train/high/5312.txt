Your appearance can do a lot for you, especially if you are in the financial industry. The more trustworthy you look, the more likely people will buy what you're selling.\nResearchers from Britain's University of Warwick Business School, University College London, and Dartmouth College, US, did a number of experiments.\nThe research team used computer software to make 40 faces, from the least to the most trustworthy-looking.\nThe study said that the difference between a trustworthy face and one that isn't as trustworthy comes from features that look slightly angry or slightly happy, even when the face is at rest. However, a slightly happy face is more likely to be trusted.\nResearchers gave participants some money and asked them which face they trusted to invest the money for them. Then researchers gave some good and bad information about the people with these faces, and asked the participants again whom they trusted.\nThe results showed that even if they got different information, the participants didn't change their choices. They were still more likely to invest their money with the more trustworthy-looking faces.\nChris Olivola, one of the study's authors, said in the University of Warwick's press release: \"It seems we are still willing to go with our own instincts   about whether we think someone looks like we can trust them. The temptation   to judge strangers by their faces is hard to resist.\"", "id": "high5312.txt"}
