They kill the others, spearing  the animals repeatedly until the water turns red. The meat from one dolphin is worth about 50,000 yen, and is sold at supermarkets across Japan.\nGreenpeace and other groups have tried to stop the hunt for years.Activists hope The Cove will bring the issue to more people internationally--and eventually in Japan.\nAlready,the Australian town of Broome dropped its 28year sistercity relationship with Taiji last month,partly because of the movie.\n\"Some regions have a tradition of eating dolphin meat,\" said fisheries official Toshinori Uoya. \"Dolphinkilling may be negative for our international image, but it is not something orders can stop.\"\nThe town government in Taiji--which has made whales and dolphins its trademark--refused to comment about The Cove, or the growing international criticism against dolphinkilling.\nMany in Taiji take the dolphin hunt for granted as part of everyday life. They are _ about The Cove,seeing themselves as powerless victims of overseas pressure to end a simple and honest way of making a living.", "id": "high5787.txt"}
