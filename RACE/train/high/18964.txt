Proposed new rules aim to improve food safety. Officials say the changes could prevent more than one million cases of food-related illnesses each year.\nThe new rules were proposed this month, exactly two years after President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act. The rules are the first step in putting the law into effect, making the biggest changes in food safety since the 1930s.\nThe law makes the Food and Drug Administration responsible for preventing food-related illnesses. Experts say this is a change from the role that the FDA has played in the past in reacting to disease outbreaks  .\nCongress passed the law after a series of outbreaks linked to bagged spinach, peanut butter and other foods.

Rules have not been released yet to require imported foods to meet the same standards as food produced in the United States.", "id": "high18964.txt"}
