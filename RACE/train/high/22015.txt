He thinks his heart is going to stop. It's never happened before, and he knows that when the boys find out he will never hear the end of it. When the girls find out, they'll never speak to him again .\nThe boy puts his head down and prays, \"Dear God, this is an emergency! I need help now! I'm dead meat .\"He looks up from his prayer and here comes the teacher with a look in her eyes that says he has been discovered.\nAs the teacher is walking toward him, a classmate named Susie is carrying a goldfish bowl that is filled with water. Susie trips  in front of the teacher and throws the bowl of water on the boy's legs.\nThe boy pretends to be angry, but all the while is saying to himself, \"Thank you, Lord! Thank you, Lord!\"\nNow all of a sudden, instead of being the object of  _ , the boy is the object of sympathy. The teacher gives him gym shorts to put on while his pants are dried out.

Susie whispers back, 'I wet my pants once too.'", "id": "high22015.txt"}
