He's dying of cancer. In his final days, he tells you, \"I have 100,000 dollars in a bank back home. When I die, make sure my son goes to medical school.\" Then he dies. But his son is a no-good playboy who has no interest in going to medical school and will waste that money away in a very short time. But your son is entering college, and he is willing to become a doctor. Which one do you give the money to for medical school?\nI've asked this question of everyone from the president of a famous university to an ordinary young soldier, and it has never failed to get a discussion going. Everyone has an opinion, most of them different, but all of them correct. Sometimes this one topic lasts the whole evening.", "id": "high8885.txt"}
