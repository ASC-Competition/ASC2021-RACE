Conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life.\nBefore offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and a variety of cups--porcelain, plastic, glass, crystal, some plain looking and cheap, some exquisite and expensive--telling them to help themselves to the coffee.\nWhen all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said: \"If you noticed, all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress. Be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee. In most cases it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink. What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you consciously went for the best cups...

They are just tools to hold and contain Life, and the type of cup we have does not define, nor change the quality of life we live. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the coffee God has provided for us.\"\nGod brews the coffee, not the cups. Enjoy your coffee!\n\"The happiest people don't have the best of everything. They just make the best of everything. \"[Z\nLive simply. Love generously. Care deeply. Speak kindly.
