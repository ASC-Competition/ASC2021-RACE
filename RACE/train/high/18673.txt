She said, \"Let's invite Wealth. Let him come in and bring us nice things. We have been so poor.\" His husband disagreed, \"My dear, why don't we invite Success? Don't you want me to be a successful man?\" Then the daughter asked, \"Would it be better to invite Love? Our life will then be filled with love!\" \"Let's take our daughter's advice,\" said the father and mother.\nSo the woman went out and asked, \"Which one of you is Love? Please come in and be our guest.\" Love got up and started walking toward the house. The other two also got up and followed him. Surprised, the lady asked Wealth and Success, \"I only invited Love. Why are you coming along?\" The two old men answered, \"If you had invited Wealth or Success, Two of us would have stayed out, but since you have invited Love, wherever he goes, we go with him. Where there is love, there is wealth and Success.\"", "id": "high18673.txt"}
