Crouch said a man sat on the dog to trim its nails. Gooch died after one claw was trimmed.\nCrouch yelled at the groomer to stop when she saw Gooch was struggling to breathe, but she said she was ignored. \"If I could have walked, I would have put my hands on her and pulled her off my dog and physically stopped her, but I can't do that.\" Gooch was not a trained service animal, but naturally helped Crouch by picking up things for her.\n\"This case is absolute animal abuse ,\" Larry Obrecht, division manager of the Oakland County Animal Shelter in Auburn Hills, said.\nPeople who read the story contacted Oakland Press to offer help. A message, from Rebecca Amett of Giggles N Wiggles Puppy Rescue, in Roseville, said, \"We have puppies to donate ... and want to help the young woman who lost her service dog.\"\n\"When Gooch was with me, I was happy,\" Crouch said, \"I think I can be happy again but no animal can replace Gooch. There's never going to be another Gooch out there but I think I will find a dog that can bring me joy again.\"", "id": "high7107.txt"}
