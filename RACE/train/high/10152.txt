We cry out for something better. That may be human nature,or perhaps it's something ingrained  in our culture. The root of the unhappiness isn't necessarily that we want things to be different.However, it's that we decided we didn't like it in the first place. We've judged it as bad,rather than saying, \"It's not bad or good, and it just is it.\"\nIn one of my books, I said, \"You should expect people to mess up and expect things to go differently than you planned\". Some readers said it's too sorrowful to expect things to go wrong.However, it's only negative if you see it as negative and judge it as bad. Instead,you could accept it as the way the world works and try to understand why that is.\nThis can be applied to whatever you do:how other people act at work,how politics works and how depressing the news media can be.Accept these things as they are,and try to understand why they're that way.  _  will save you a lot of sadness,because you'll no longer say, \"Oh, I wish bad things didn't happen!''\nDoes it mean you can never change things? Not at all. But change things not because you can't accept things as they are, but because you enjoy the process of changing, learning and growing.\nCan we make this world a better place? You can say that you'll continue to try to do things to help others, to grow as a person, to make a difference in this world. That's the correct path you choose to take,because you enjoy that path. Therefore, when you find yourself judging and wishing for difference, try a different approach: accept, and understand. It might lead to some interesting results.", "id": "high10152.txt"}
