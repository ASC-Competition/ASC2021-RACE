But now teachers in Germany are scared, too, as they are being graded by their students.\nMany teachers are opposed to it. They don't mind being evaluated . But they are upset because the results are then being posted on the Internet and accessible to millions of Internet users. On the websitewww.spickmich.deduring the past four months students have posted evaluation of 100,000 teachers.\nThe teachers are graded on categories such as \"motivated\", \"good instruction\", \"easy examinations\", or even \"sexy\". Many teachers think that their privacy has been violated.\nThe creators of the website say that the students are only being offered the chance to provide teachers with some feedback about their classroom instruction. Bernd Dicks, who founded the website with three friends, says that the students are largely quite satisfied with their teachers. On a grading scale of one to six, the teachers' average grade is 2.7 and it has been improving lately. He often says the impression is that students are bullying  their teachers. But there is also bullying of the students by teachers.\n\"Teachers must also learn to live with criticism,\" he added. But still, the website is not totally immune from manipulation , as one teacher near the northern city of Hanover recently proved. He registered himself on the website as a student and then rated his own teaching colleagues highly. Within a few days, seven of his colleagues were listed in the top 10 ranking of Germany's best teachers.", "id": "high2286.txt"}
