I live in Germany with my wife and three kids. My parents live in the UK. I want my kids to have as much contact with their grandparents as possible. The kids all use e-mail, Skype and SMS but my parents won't. I've bought them a laptop, paid for broadband, given them both mobile phones and a digital camera, but they won't use them.

What can I do with these \" _ \"?\nDaniel, Buremburg, Germany \nActually, the original technophobes were the Luddites, a group of cloth workers in 19thcentury Britain during the Industrial Revolution. The Luddite cloth workers, who traditionally made cloth by hand, were worried that machines were going to take away their jobs and way of life. These machines could make cloth much faster and cheaper than humans. In 1811 and 1812 the Luddites destroyed the machines that they hated so much, but the British government supported the factory owners. Many Luddites were arrested.

An example is the mobiles made by the US company, Jitterbug. Instead of icons and menus the Jitterbug phones ask users simple \"yes/no\" questions and have larger keypads. The company realized that there are potentially 100 million older users in the US alone. \nGraham, Patras, Greece", "id": "high20625.txt"}
