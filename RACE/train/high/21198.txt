The future stretched out ahead, in the valley, hills and mountains. The past is there too, but today I prefer to walk forward, to live \"in the now\", and truly see all the good things in the world. Light clouds float high in the bright blue sky, and the sunlight shines off the house in the distance, People ride bicycles on the bike path that follows the river. They talk and laugh together. What a beautiful and peaceful scene it makes!\nMy heart is suddenly full of joy as I remember it is New Year's Day. A day to start afresh and I feel overwhelming gratitude for the gift of life God has given me. I pass by a man holding his son, on rot two years old, whose face is a study in pure joy and wonder, as he looks out over the green hills and towering mountains. Tears gather  in my eyes with the sweetness of this simple thought. A man sits gazing into the distance. In this lonely scene, I'm reminded of other days in the past when sadness and hopelessness were my only companions. I say a silent prayer for him, and thanks to God. Then I walk on.\nA young couple crouch next to a bicycle that has thrown its chain. As they look up, I smile and say \"Happy New Year.\" They smile and wish me the same. It is a simple thing, but for a moment  _ have become one with the world and a sudden joy takes my breath away. An old woman leans on a fence post. She doesn't seem either happy or sad, just gazes into the past, or maybe the future. A feeling of timeless peace flows through me and all fear of what the future may bring disappears. I thank her with my thoughts, and move on.\nI walk by a stand of young trees. A loud burst of cheerful chirping from the little woods, and I can't help but laugh out loud. As I reach home, I say another thanks to God for the gift \"now\". It has taken a long time to find it, and although I can't keep it with me all of the time, I know that whatever the New year will bring, there will be joy and enough love of \"now\" to help me through the hard times that we all must face.\nHappy New Year!", "id": "high21198.txt"}
