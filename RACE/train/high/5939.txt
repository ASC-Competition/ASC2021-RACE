Even if they live in a city,they can go on adventures in the garden or the park.\nChildren often need a helping hand from mum and dad.They need to be shown what to do and where to go.Andy Simpson from National Health Service says,\"We want parents to see what this magical wonder product does for their kids' development,independence and creativity,by giving wild time a go\".\nSo despite the complicated world that young people grow up in now,it seems that going back to basics and experiencing\"nature's playground\"is what modern children need.David Bond from Project Wild Thing says,\"We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine,freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted\".\nThis might sound a bit old fashioned to you or maybe,like me,it's made you think about sticking on your boots,getting outdoors and reliving your childhood.There's no age limit on enjoying yourself!", "id": "high5939.txt"}
