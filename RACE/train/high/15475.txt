It's convenient: three or four words per exchange. It takes cleverness, concentration and quick fingers.\nAnd it requires very simple language. There's neither time nor space for explanations. Why waste valuable time telling six friends you have to leave for a moment to take care of your little brother when BRB (be right back) will do?\nWant to enter a conversation? Just type PMFJI (pardon me for jumping in).\nInterested in whom you're talking to? Type A/S/L, the nearly universal request to know your pal's age, sex and location. You may get 15/M/NY as a reply from your pal.\nIf something makes you laugh, say you're OTF (on the floor), or LOL (laughing out loud), or join the two into ROTFL (rolling on the floor laughing).\nAnd when it's time to get back to work or go to bed, you type GTG (got to go) or TTYL (talk to you later).\nPeople want to write as fast as possible, and they want to get their ideas across as quickly as they can. Capital letters are left in the dust, except when expressing feeling, as it takes more time to hold down the \"Shift\" key and use capitals. Punctuation   is going too.", "id": "high15475.txt"}
