People usually have trouble in arranging. The following will give you some practical suggestions on paying a valuable visit to the famous park.\nWhen to go?\nWhile it's always busy, Disney World is slightly slower between mid-January and March. It's summer when the visitors , combined with the heat and humidity , are crowded. Your best choice is either early in the morning or late in the day--- often you can enjoy more rides in the first or last two hours of the day than you can the entire rest of the day combined.\nWhere to stay?\nThe question: to stay on Disney World Resort property or not. Disney World offers three resort pricing: Deluxe , Moderate, and Value, with good facilities and in-hotel attractions. That said, they all offer \"Extra Magic Hours\"(early access to the theme parks), guaranteed entry when the parks are over-crowded, and frequent shuttle service to the many attractions. Off-property hotels will have shuttle transfers, but often at less regular intervals ,wasting more time in transport. You'll also need a rental car, which adds to the expense, making up for saving in the hotel rate. The \"Magic Your Way Package\" is a good value if you have a large family.\nWhat to do?\nMake use of the \"Fast Pass\" , which , for no extra cost, allow you to insert your entrance ticket into a particular machine at the attraction and receive a schedule ride time a little later on. For example, use your Fast Pass ticket at a ride just before getting lunch. Once you're done eating, you can return to the ride and jump right on during the busiest time of day. At the Animal Kingdom, the animals are most active either early or late in the day, so plan accordingly. Thankfully _ is fit for the least busy times of day in the park. Study the map of the park the night before to plan your visit. You'll save time by knowing where things are and where you're headed.", "id": "high2352.txt"}
