The teens kept what the authors described as \"regular working/studying hours\" and were not previously diagnosed with any particular sleep irregularity.\nHe observed that the above-15 call group kept more irregular sleeping hours than the lower-use group,had more difficulty falling asleep,more difficulty waking up,and experienced more sleep disruptions .\nBader said that among young people,a  ly recent technological invention like the cellphone has quickly become existed nearly everywhere,giving rise to considerable pressure to keep in touch. And this pressure can develop into an addiction,with serious negative results for teenager health.\n\"We see more and more people--especially the young generation-- who grew up with these kinds of items and gadgets in their hands,\" Bader said. \"And they become dependent on the technology. So,we have to teach young people to be structured. To know when to have the cellphone on,and when to switch it off. To avoid becoming the slave of technology,instead of the master. \"\nDr. Mary Carskadon expressed little surprise with the finding. \" Interpersonal contact is one of the things that's best at keeping us awake,\" she observed. \"And so,a young person receiving cellphone texts or phone calls is going to have more deep disturbances. And they are going to be tired and restless,and probably,as a result,going to use more stimulants .And judgment is not always the best in our teenage years. So, that's where I think parental attention to this issue may be useful. \"", "id": "high18074.txt"}
