These cross  cultural partnerships, while beneficial in many ways, are also highlighting tensions that expose differences in work experience, pay levels and communication.\nIn the last few years, a growing number of Americans in their 20s and 30s have been heading to China for employment, attracted by its faster  growing economy and lower jobless rate. Their Chinese coworkers are often around the same age. But the two groups were raised differently. The Americans have had more exposure to freemarket principles. \"Young Americans were brought up in a commercial environment,\" said Neng Zhao, 28, a senior associate at Blue Oak Capital, a private firm based in Beijing. \"We weren't. So the workplace is a unique learning process for my generation.\"\nManagers hiring workers in China appear to be paying for Western experience. Foreigners tend to earn 10 to 15 percent more than their Chinese counterparts (persons working in similar positions), said Michael Norman, senior vice president at Sibson Consulting, an American firm.

On the other hand, Chinese workers have a deeper understanding of the influences, like Confucianism and Communism, which play a part in their country's culture and economy.\nIt is important and necessary for Americans working in China to adjust, said Mr. Norman, who works on management and work force issues for multinational companies operating in Asia.\n\"In the West, there is such a bonus on getting things done quickly, but when you come to work in China, you need to work on listening and being more patient and understanding of local ways of doing business,\" he said.", "id": "high23178.txt"}
