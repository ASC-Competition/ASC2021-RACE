As a parent you might never guess how it can benefit your child. It helps your child:\nDevelop Social Skills\nAs children play pretend games,they explore relationships between family members,friends and coworkers and learn more about how people interact.Playing doctors,they imagine how physicians care for their patients.Imaginative play helps develop empathy  with others.If children can imagine how it feels to be left out of a game or to lose a pet,they are better able to help those in need.They become more willing to play fair,to share,and to cooperate.\nBuild Selfconfidence\nYoung children have very little control over their lives.Imagining oneself as a builder of skyscrapers or a super hero defending the planet is inspiring to children.It helps them develop confidence in their abilities and their potential.\nPromote Intellectual Growth\nUsing imagination is the beginning of abstract thought.Children who can see a king's castle in a mound of sand or a delicious dinner in a mud pie are learning to think symbolically.This skill is important in school where a child will have to learn that numbers symbolize groups of objects,letters symbolize sounds,and so on.\nPractice Language Skills\nKids who pretend with their friends do a lot of talking.This helps increase their vocabulary,improve sentence structure and develop communication skills.\nGet Rid of Fears\nPretending can help children get rid of their fears and worries.When children roleplay the big,bad monster under the bed,they gain a sense of control over him and he doesn't seem quite so big or so bad.", "id": "high563.txt"}
