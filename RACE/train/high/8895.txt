I knew it would suit me best at first sight. But when I looked at the price tag  , I knew I had to give it up.\nThe love for beautiful clothes has been planted in my heart the day when I was born to be a woman. Several years ago I read an article in a magazine. The article stated that when a woman is at her best time, she is usually poor or tasteless, so she can't get the right clothes; when she can afford to buy the clothes she likes, she often finds that they do not suit her anymore.\nOn the way home, I was quite disturbed by such thoughts. It was just a pity, like many other pities. I thought to myself this way. But when I was about to enter the building where I was living, I saw the big mirror placed in the entrance.
