But he liked to read and write very much. Once he discussed a question with his friend in letters. His father found the letters and read them. He felt Ben did not express himself well. Nor did Ben make his meaning clear. He agreed that his father was right, From then on, he paid more attention to the style of his writing so that he could write better.\nAbout that time he bought a copy of the British periodical  called The Spectator (<<>> ). He read it over and over. He thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to write in the same style.\nWith this in mind, he studied some of the stories and made a note of the thought in each sentence. Then, a few days later, without looking at the magazine, he tried to write the stories. He tried to express each thought as fully as it had been expressed before. Then he compared his writing with the magazine. He found some of his faults in the compositions.\nIn this way he discovered he needed to know many more words. He felt that writing poetry would help him since that needed to use many different words which had the same meaning. So he turned some of the stories into poems; and after a time, he wrote them as stories again. He insisted on doing this for a long time.\nHe learned much from his efforts and went on to practise his writing. Then he became the first famous writer in American history.", "id": "high20208.txt"}
