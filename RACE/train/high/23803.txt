This dictionary is the largest single volume English-Chinese, Chinese-English dictionary and contains 670,000 words and phrases after five years of preparation.Sixty editors from the Oxford University Press and its partner in China--the Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press--worked together on the project.According to Julie Kleeman, the dictionary's chief editor, most of the firm's editors were Chinese, while about one fourth were native-English speakers.\n\"We don't want to make it florid(, we want it to be modern and conversational...many of the words in the present dictionary are no longer in use,\"  said Kleeman. \"The need for studying Chinese by foreigners today is totally different from decades ago...Precise, native and practical--that is our core advantage,\"  she said.\nKleeman said newer publications updates will be available only for the online version as language often changes too quickly for book versions to keep pace. The online version will also offer a Chinese phonetic pronunciation guide. The online version, allowing access via different platforms from the PC to the iPad, will be ready \"as soon as possible\",  Kleeman said.", "id": "high23803.txt"}
