Though Arab-Americans as a community have made great contributions to American society in fields from literature to politics to medicine, many Americans know very little about Americans of Arab backgrounds.\nArab history in the United Statesgoes back to the late 1800's when large numbers of Arab immigrants first began making their journey to a land known simply as \"Amreeka\".\nHistorians generally describe Arab immigration to Americain two waves. The first wave took place between 1860 and 1924.The first wave consisted of Lebanese and Syrian, and some Egyptian immigrants. These new immigrants, who were mostly Christian, came toAmericain search of better opportunities. Even the doomed Titanic, which set sail forAmericain 1912,had close to a hundred Arab passengers aboard. The majority of Arab-Americans today are descendents of the first wave of immigrants; they are the third or more generation Americans.\nThe second wave of immigrants followed after World War II, caused by political unrest in the Middle East. This second wave of immigrants consists of mainly Arab Muslims and continues to this day.\nArab-Americans make up 3 million of the population in the United States, according to demographers. And quite different from popular belief, 64% of them are American-born. 82% percent of Arab-Americans are US citizens.\nArab-Americans are beyond the national average in both education and income. Education is important among Arab-Americans; 82% have high school diplomas, 36% have bachelor's degrees or higher, and 15% have graduate degrees. The average income among Arab-Americans is $39580, which is higher than the USaverage.", "id": "high19324.txt"}
