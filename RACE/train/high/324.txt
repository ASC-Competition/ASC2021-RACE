At least it shows she's trying to explain something to me. I feel a little better.\nDecember 3\nThis morning Sharon said she had only told one person and didn't know why everyone seemed to know. Yes, I am an adopted   daughter. But she had promised to keep it a secret for ever!\nDecember 5\nI wish I had a friend I could really trust all of the time. I thought I found that friend, but I haven't and it's making me miserable  ! It's wrong to tell her all about it. She gains my trust, and then loses it.\nDecember 7\nI have a nice room, beautiful house and everything I've ever wanted. My adoptive parents will give me all the things I've ever dreamed of. Yet all the money in the world can't buy what I want now. I want for Sharon to be my best friend again.\nDecember 10\nSharon just called. She said she thought it might help if we spent more time together. She worried that I would switch schools  . She is the best friend I've ever had. When I'm with Sharon, I can be myself.
