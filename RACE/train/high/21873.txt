It was an idea for saving money for the company by increasing prices. At the same time, Smith suggested that the company sell goods of less value.\nIf his employer liked the idea, Smith might be given more pay. Perhaps he might even get a better job with the company.\nBusiness had been very slow. So Mister Smith's employer thought a few minutes about the idea. But then she shook her head. \"I am sorry, Smith,\" his employer said. \"It just will not wash.\"\nNow, the meaning of these English words should be, \"It will not get clean.\" Yet, Smith's idea did not have anything to do with making something clean. So why did his employer say, \"It will not wash?\"\nMost word experts agree that \"it will not wash\" means it will not work. In the nineteenth century in England, the expression came to mean an unde-pendable statement. It was used mainly to describe an idea. But sometimes it was used about a person.\nHappily for the young employee Smith, his employer wanted him to do well in the company. So the employer \"talked turkey\" to him. She said, \"Your idea would be unfair to our buyers. Think of another way to save money.\"\nA century ago, to talk turkey meant to talk pleasantly. Turkeys in the barnyard  were thought to be speaking pleasantly to one another. In recent years, the saying has come to mean an attempt to teach something important.\nMister Smith thought of a better idea after his employer talked turkey to him. He was given an increase in pay. So if your idea \"will not wash,\" try \"talking turkey\" to yourself and come up with a better idea.", "id": "high21873.txt"}
