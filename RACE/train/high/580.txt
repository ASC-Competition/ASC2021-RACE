They planned to stay at the very same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years ago. They both had jobs, so it was decided that the husband would fly to Florida on a Thursday, and his wife would follow him the next day. Upon arriving as planned, the husband checked into the hotel. There he decided to open his laptop and send his wife an e-mail back in Minneapolis. However, he accidentally left off one letter in her address and sent the e-mail without noticing his error.\nIn the same time: In Houston, a woman had just returned from her husband's funeral . He was a minister of many years who had been \"called home to glory\" following a heart attack. The woman checked her e-mail, expecting message from family and friends. Upon reading the first message, she fainted and fell to the floor. Her son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor and saw the computer screen which read:\nTo: My Loving Wife\nFrom: Your Departed Husband\nSubject: I've arrived!\nI've just arrived and have been checked in. I see that everything has been prepared for your arrival tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then. Hope your journey is as uneventful as mine was.\nP.S. Sure is hot down here.", "id": "high580.txt"}
