Do you remember a time when you were happy? Are you seeking happiness today?\n   Many have sought a variety of sources for their feelings of happiness. Some have put their heart and effort into their work. Too many have turned to drugs and alcohol. Most of their efforts have a root in one common fact: People are looking for a lasting source of happiness.\n   Unfortunately, I believe that happiness escapes many because they misunderstand the process and journey of finding it. I have heard many people say that, \"I'll be happy when I get my new promotion.\" Or \"I'll be happy when I lose that extra 20 pounds.\" The list goes on and on. You probably have a few of your own you could add if you wanted.\n    _ is dangerous because it presupposes that happiness is a \"response\" to having, being or doing something. In life, we all experience stimulus and response. Stimulus is when a dog barks at you and bares his teeth. Response is when your heart beats faster, your palms get sweaty and you prepare to run. Today, some people think that an expensive car is a stimulus. Happiness is a response. A great paying job is a stimulus. Happiness is a response. A loving relationship is a stimulus. Happiness is a response. This belief leaves us thinking and feeling: \" I'll be happy when...\"\n    It has been my finding that actually the opposite is true. I believe that happiness is a stimulus and response is what life brings to those who are truly happy. When we are happy, we tend to have more success in our work. When we are happy, people want to be around us and enjoy loving relationships. When we are happy, we more naturally take better care of our bodies and enjoy good health. Happiness is NOT a response--rather, it is a stimulus.\n    Happiness is a conscious choice we make every day of our lives. For unknown reason to me, many choose to be painful, unsuccessful and angry most of the time. Happiness is not something that happens to us after we get something we want--we usually get things we want AFTER we choose to be happy.\n    I have made only one simple rule for my own happiness: Every day above ground is a GOOD day. Therefore, I tend to have a lot of good (and happy) days continually.", "id": "high20277.txt"}
