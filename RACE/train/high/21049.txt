We didn't realize how much of an international hit it would become.\"\nThe response, he said, reinforces   the worldwide movement to save endangered and rare species.\nAvailable ringtones include the howl of an endangered Mexican gray wolf, the bellows of an Arctic beluga whale and the calls of dozens of other mammals, birds and reptiles. Website visitors can also get cellphone wallpaper and facts for each of the species.\nAnd later this year, the website will be available in Spanish and more ringtones from species in Latin America will be added, Galvin said.", "id": "high21049.txt"}
