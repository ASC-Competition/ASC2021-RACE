When the Keesling family of Indiana was about to be killed by carbon monoxide, their cat clawed at the wife Cathy's hair until she woke up and called for help.\nNo one could explain their timely heroics.\nBoth pets were rescued by their owners in _ -----Toby as a 4-week-old thrown into a garbage bin to die, and Winnie as a week-old orphan hiding under a barn, so helpless that Cathy's husband, Eric, had to feed her milk with an eyedropper.\nAs the Keeslings recalled it, a gas-driven pump being used broke down, spreading carbon monoxide through the house.

He never does that, but he did, and saved my life.\"\nBoth Toby and Winnie accompanied their owners to the awards luncheon.", "id": "high4148.txt"}
