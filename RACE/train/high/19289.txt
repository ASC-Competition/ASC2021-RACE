But it's not because of any physical obstruction. It's usually because the PC monitor in her refrigerator's door has informed her that a new email message has arrived.\n       Rikke and her husband are taking part in a six-month trial sponsored by a Danish firm and two Swedish partners. They hope to show that computers can be put to much more practical daily use than most people think. Fifty families and singles were provided with a free model known as the \"Screenfridge\" for the duration of trial.\n       \"It's really very clever\", says Rikke.
