The scientists studied reactions from one-year-old babies to their mums' voices even when they were speaking both English and Greek, and keeping the same tone of voice. The academics found that babies reproduced the same reactions regardless of whether they knew the language.\nStudy leader Dr Merideth Gattis of Cardiff University's School of Psychology says, \"What this work showed was that children could have access to understanding simply through tone of voice. We did 'whoops' and 'there' in two languages and got exactly the same results.\" The research, published in the journal Cognitive Development, was conducted on 84 babies aged between 14 and 18 months, over the course of a year, with none of the babies having any previous exposure to Greek.\nDr Gattis says that children respond to tone clues in their parents' voices from an early age.\nShe says, \"Tone of voice is a really useful signal of what someone is thinking. We never have direct access to other people's minds, except the signals in language that they give out.\" She says the study shows that it is less important what parents say than how they say it.\nDr Gattis adds, \"A child may ask if you like his / her drawing, for example. You might say yes, but if you don't sound enthusiastic, the meaning may not get across.\" Before children begin to speak, parents should use exaggerated tone when speaking to them.", "id": "high3947.txt"}
