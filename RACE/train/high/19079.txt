His teachers thought that he was stupid and that Einstein's thoughts and words were jumbled . His schoolwork was poor. Playing the violin was all he was good at as a child.\nWhen he was ten, he met Dr. Max Talmy. Talmy talked with the boy and tried to help him. They discussed books and Einstein showed an interest in maths. He understood difficult problems and ideas. Inside this \"stupid\" boy was a genius.\nSchoolwork never became easy for Einstein. He could not learn things by heart. Paying attention was hard for him. He even did not passed his first test to enter college.\nBecause of his learning problems, Einstein made few friends. He was shy in groups of people. Yet he overcame his shortcomings. He became a well-known scientist in the field of physics. He was one of the most important thinkers of the modern age.", "id": "high19079.txt"}
