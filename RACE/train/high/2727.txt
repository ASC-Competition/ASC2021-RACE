When entering his new bedroom, he saw that it was full of toys but it was tidy. That day he played all he liked, but went to bed without tidying up.\nThe next morning, when Jack got up, he found all the toys had been put back in their proper places. He was sure that no one had entered his bedroom, but the boy didn't pay much attention to it. The exact same thing happened that day, and the next day. But on the fourth day when he went to get his favourite toy, the toy jumped out of his hands and said, \"I don't want to play with you!\"\nJack felt surprised, but the same happened with every toy he touched. Finally, one toy said to him:\n\"We don't want to play with you. You always leave us so far away from our proper places. You don't know how _ it is for us to climb back up onto the shelves, or jump into the box. We feel most uncomfortable and unhappy. You don't know how uncomfortable and cold the floor is! We don't play with you any more if you don't promise to leave us in our proper places before you go to bed.\"\nJack remembered how comfortable he felt in his bed and how bad he felt when he had once slept in a chair. He realized how badly he had treated his friends, the toys. He asked for their forgiveness , and from that day on he always put his toys nicely in their proper places before he got into bed.", "id": "high2727.txt"}
