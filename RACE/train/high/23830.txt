Londoners often give the impression of being reserved.\nBut The News York Times recently issued a report headlined True Londoners Are Extinct. What defines a Londoner exactly? The criteria can be tricky. \nThe newspaper discovered that over the last decade, the foreign-born population in London reached 2.6 million, about a third of the city's population. \n\"Foreigners can't be Londoners,\" a British political campaigner told the newspaper. \n A true Londoner would never support Manchester United, the newspaper quoted a man in a pub. Fair enough, since one has four other top league clubs to choose from, you must be too ignorant to be a Londoner.\nNext issue is where you live. There are those who believe that true Londoners are cockneys--those who were born within earshot of Bow Bells. \nThe oddest claim of all was from a pub goer: \"A real Londoner would never, never, ever, eat at one of those bloody Angus steakhouses in the West End.

North Londoners forget there's a south beyond the South Bank. East London is close to the port and the site of early industrial development. It's often considered one of the poorest areas in the city. \n\"You can't cut the prejudice out of London,\" a university student said to the newspaper. But it is this uneasy charm that gives the city its unique dynamic.", "id": "high23830.txt"}
