I've been in some of the grandest houses in prefix = st1 /America, and it's clear no one lives there. Earlier this year, I had dinner in a mud hut inEthiopia, where we sat on chairs next to the hostess' bed -- a home that had more warmth than any house I've been in since.\nNow John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, \"This isn't a book about houses; it's a book about homes. About the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped,\" Edwards writes. \"The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.\"\nWhether you're sitting in an airport flight now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the  s to arrive, you know what he's talking about.\nWe've lived in our townhouse for 21 years.

Even the lamp in the west living room window, which I could see far down the road when driving home late at night, still shines.\nWhile all this talk about childhood memories can be warm and comforting, home is whom you're with, not where you are. As Edwards writes, \"Home is family. Home is safety. Home is faith.\"\nHappy homecoming.", "id": "high23894.txt"}
