But there's a secret world hidden behind the balloons, castles and cotton candy -- a place where wild cats wander at midnight, Mickey Mouse hides in the wallpaper, and movie stars drink martinis behind closed doors.\nCat security -- It's not easy keeping the ground of Disneyland spotless, as well as free of unwanted pests. Every night after closing time, 200 wild cats were freed into the park to help keep the rodent population under control. Though Disney doesn't comment on the matter, rumor has it that the cat taskforce dates back to 1957. After unsuccessful attempts to chase them out of the park, Disney decided to put the cats to work instead.\nHidden Mickeys--At Disneyland the round-eared Mickey Mouse image is everywhere.

Cast members have a Disney \"look book\" that details the fresh-faced ideal--no long fingernails, beards, or unnaturally colored hair allowed. It's a return to Walt Disney's All-American standards: when the park opened even guests with facial hair weren't allowed entrance.", "id": "high4275.txt"}
