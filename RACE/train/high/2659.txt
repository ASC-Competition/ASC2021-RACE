The Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII of England, opened the tower. Of the 700 suggestions that were handed in, Gustave Eiffel's was chosen.\nHowever, at first, it was not well accepted by all and a group of people -- including many well-known writers and painters at that time -- were fiercely against its design.\nBeing about 300 meters in height, and 7,000 tons in weight, it was the world's tallest building until 1930. It was a great project for France. 300 workers took two years to build it. It isn't an ordinary building, since it is almost made of steel. For example, its body moves around at most 12 cm in heavy wind. Moreover, its height changes up to 15 cm according to the temperature.\nIt was almost destroyed in 1909, but was saved because of its antenna , which is used for communication at that time. Beginning in 1910 it became part of the International Time Service. French radio and French television have also made good use of its height.\nThe Eiffel Tower has also seen a few strange things. In 1923, a journalist rode a bicycle down from the first level of it. And in 1954, a mountain climber climbed on top of it and tried to measure its exact height.\nAnyway, although its birth was difficult, it is now well accepted all over the world. It has been considered as one of the symbols of Paris.", "id": "high2659.txt"}
