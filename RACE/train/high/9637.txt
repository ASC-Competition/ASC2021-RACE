The thrower's lack of distance was a blessing. Had he gathered tips from the competitors of the hammer throw  competition, which was taking place in the infield at the same time as the 100 final, the bottle could have hit one of the competitors. It ended up landing a few feet from Blake (lane5).\nEdith Bosch, a female Dutch judoka who won a bronze medal earlier during the Olympics, claimed that the man who threw the bottle was sitting near her and that she \"beat\" him. Whether that's true or the hyperbole   of an aggravated athlete was unclear in the minutes after the incident. Pictures show a group of Dutch athletes sitting behind the starting area.\nPolice took the man into custody . He will appear in court on Monday morning.\nNeither Bolt nor Blake said they knew of the incident until they were informed by reporters. \"I don't know who would have done that,\" Bolt said.\nGatlin was aware of it but implied it was only a slight distraction. \"I didn't know what it was,\" he said, according to the BBC, \"but when you're in those blocks, the whole stadium is so quiet that you can hear a pin drop.\"", "id": "high9637.txt"}
