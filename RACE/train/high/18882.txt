As growing up, I thought everyone ate dinner as a family. However, now I realized that is not the case. In fact, most families eat dinner together only about four times a week and 10% of families only eat together twice a week. And as children get older and the number of activities they are involved in increases, the meals eaten as a family decrease.\nStudies show that families who eat dinner together benefits in a variety of ways. Eating together helps families achieve better communication, children do better in school and are better adjusted, and the entire family enjoys better nutrition .\nIncreased Communication\nEating dinner together as a family provides opportunities for communication. A \"Family Dinner Experiment \" conducted by Oprah Winfrey in 1993 challenged five families to eat dinner together every night for a month for at least half an hour. At first the families found it difficult but by the end of the study they wanted to continue eating dinner together. The biggest surprise for the parents was \"How much their children treasured the dependence time with their parents at the table.\"\nSuperior Academic Performance\nFamily meals also help improve school performance. A 1994 survey by Louis Harris and Associates had 2000 seniors take an academic test and answer a list of personal questions. Researchers found that \"Students who regularly ate dinner with their families four or more times a week scored better than those who ate family dinners three or fewer times a week. These results crossed racial  lines and were a greater indicator than whether the child was in a one or two-parent family.\"\nBetter Adjusted\nA study by Drs. Bowden and Zeisz found that \"the teens who were best adjusted ate a meal with an adult in their family at an average of 5.4 days a week, compared to 3.3 days for teens who didn't show good adjustment.\" The well-adjusted teens were \"less likely to do drugs or be depressed and were more motivated at school and had better relationships.\" Dr. Bowen said, \"that mealtimes were a sort of 'marker' for other positive family attributes and seemed to play an important role in helping teens deal well with the stresses of adolescence  .\"", "id": "high18882.txt"}
