Here is one interview which explores the fundamental questions in life.\nQuestion: Could you introduce yourself first?\nAnswer: My name is Misbah, 27 years old. I was born in a war-torn area. Right now I'm a web designer.\nQ: What are your great memories?\nA: My parents used to take us to hunt birds, climb trees, and play in the fields. For me it was like a holiday because we were going to have fun all day long. Those are my great memories.\nQ: Does your childhood mean a lot to you?\nA: Yes. As life was very hard, I used to work to help bring money in for the family. I spent my childhood working, with responsibilities beyond my age. However, it taught me to deal with problems all alone. I learnt to be independent.\nQ: What changes would you like to make in your life?\nA: If I could change something in my life, I'd change it so that my childhood could have taken place in another area. I would have loved to live with my family in freedom. Who cares whether we have much money, or whether we have a beautiful house? It doesn't matter as long as I can live with my family and we are safe.\nQ: How do your get along with your parents?\nA: My parents supported me until I came of age. I want to give back what I've got. That's our way. But I am working in another city. My only contact with my parents now is through the phone, but I hate using it. It filters  out your emotion and leaves your voice only. My deepest feelings should be passed through sight, hearing and touch.", "id": "high919.txt"}
