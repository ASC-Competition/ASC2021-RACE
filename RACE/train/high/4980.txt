Shortly afterwards, I came up with an observation: If you tell five people during the day that they look nice, at the end of the day, six people feel great. Here are some fruitful experiences I have with this.\nOne day, I was riding with a friend when we rolled to a stop at the traffic light. As we waited for the light to turn green, a man walked across the crosswalk. He looked very together, so I called out, \"Hey, you look _ today!\" Pointing towards a building, he said, \"Thanks, but I was sharper there.\" His comment puzzled me. But before I could ask about it, the light turned green, and we drove on. I asked my friend what he meant. My friend informed me that we were at the corner of a radio station and the man was the voice on the radio. Then I understood. But no matter who he was the biggest thing for me was that he was smiling when he accepted my compliment  .\nLater that day, there was a woman standing on the corner where we were turning, and I yelled   the compliment again, \"You look nice!\" She was just taking a sip of a bottle of water and started to laugh. I felt good to get a laugh.\nAnother day, while seated in a restaurant, there was a lady sitting near me. I really did not care for her skirt, but she did look nice in it, so I told her, \"You look nice today.\" She looked at me and rolled her eyes a little. Well, her friend sitting next to her told her, \"He just gave you a compliment. Say thank you.\" I don't remember whether she said \"thank you\" or not, but what I did notice was that her friend was smiling at my \"You look nice today\" compliment.", "id": "high4980.txt"}
