Broad, quotes a long-time yoga teacher who \"...has come to believe that 'the vast majority of people' should give up yoga altogether. It's simply too likely to cause harm.\" He goes on to describe a number of cases where people have been injured doing yoga, including himself.\nThe research in the article isn't groundbreaking: doing any form of exercise you could potentially hurt yourself. If you look at the injury rates of other physical activities, the number of injuries sustained from yoga would pale in comparison.\nPracticing yoga is just like anything in life: You have to push yourself in order to grow. But you also have to know your limits and when you're breaking them. If you stick to your comfort zone, you'll never be able to increase your flexibility. If you push to the point where you're not only uncomfortable, but in real pain, you'll likely injure yourself.\nThe reasons that yoga causes \"serious injury\", according to the Times story, range from students' physical weaknesses to inexperienced teachers pushing too hard to the growing number of inflexible \"urbanites who sit in chairs all day\" trying hard to twist themselves into difficult postures.\nYoga is called a \"practice\" for a reason. You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to tackle every pose. It doesn't matter if you can touch the floor with your palms during your first forward bend or your thousandth, or if you never get there.\nWe go to the mat to learn to better listen to what our bodies are telling us, and to better hear that quiet inner voice drowned out by the noise of our busy lives. It's a shame to discourage the majority of people from practicing yoga and missing out on all of the mind-body benefits that going to the mat has to offer.", "id": "high4842.txt"}
