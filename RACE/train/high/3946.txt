So he gave up his job, his home, and his friends, and spent all his time guarding the cave.\nHe was so dedicated to it that he hardly ate or drank, and before long he fell ill. One day, when he could hardly move at all, he decided to share the treasure.\nHe crawled into the cave to get a handful of jewels, but discovered, to his horror, that it was empty except for a small emerald . The man took it, and gave it to the first person he came by, a woman.\nThen an old man came by. \"What bad luck!\" the man said. \"Just a moment ago I gave a woman the last of the treasure I was guarding.\"\n\"Are you sure there is nothing left?\" the old man asked.\nThe man took him into the cave, where they found a chest with jewels and some bags of gold. The man was shocked, and the old man explained to him, \"At last! At last someone has broken the spell of this cave. This is the Cave of Treasure, and you're the first to have passed its great test. Many have dedicated their lives to this cave, only to end up realizing there was nothing here...\"\n\"And why does this happen?\" the man asked.\n\"This magic cave has only as many riches as your own heart. When someone discovers it, the cave is filled with treasure, but later, when they have devoted themselves to guarding the treasure, their hearts empty, as does the cave. The only way to fill it is by filling your heart with all that is good, as you did by giving the woman that last jewel.\"\nFrom that day on, the man understood that it was better to share than to keep. Thanks to the cave and the old man, he became noble and generous.", "id": "high3946.txt"}
