Perhaps, some parents disagree with this idea, saying, \"Switch off the music and concentrate!\" Well, if that's the case with your parents, you might now be able to convince them that you have science on your side.\nThe company gave 26 participants a series of different tasks for five days in a row, including spell checking, mathematical word problems, data entry, and abstract reasoning. The participants completed these tasks while listening to music or no music at all.\nThe results showed that while music was playing, 88% of participants produced their most accurate test results and 81% completed their fastest work. David Lewis, chairman of Mindlab International, toldThe Telegraph, \"Music is a very powerful management tool if you want to increase not only the efficiency of your workforce but also their emotional state... _ are going to become more positive about the work.\"\nHowever, you may have a list of your favorite songs, but not all kinds of music match all homework.

In the study, pop music enabled participants to complete their tasks 58% faster than when listening to no music at all. If you are reviewing your English writing, pop music is the best choice, as it is the best kind for spell checking. It cut mistakes by 14%, compared to listening to no music. After finishing your homework, do you often take time to check your answers? Maybe, some dance music is suitable for you.", "id": "high14911.txt"}
