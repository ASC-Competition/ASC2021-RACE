This is not healthy in our opinion.\"\nIIT-Mumbai, with about 5,000 students, is one of seven IITs across India which are considered to be among the finest engineering schools in the world. They are also a talent pool for global technology giants. But their hard courses, tough competition and lonely campus lifestyle have taken an effect on students. Depressive and dysfunctional  lifestyles are known to be common among IIT students, and at least nine have committed suicide in the past five years. Students have unlimited free Internet access in their boarding houses to help them in their studies, but many also use it to surf, chat, download movies and music, blog and for gaming.\nStarting Monday, Internet access will be banned between 11 p.m. and 12.30 p.m. at IIT-Mumbai's 13 boarding buildings to encourage students to sleep early and to try and force them out of their \"shells\", Gopalan said. But the move has not gone down well with students who say they hate their lives being regulated. \"Now they will say we need to listen to a lullaby  to go to sleep,\" said Rajiv, an electronics student.", "id": "high6632.txt"}
