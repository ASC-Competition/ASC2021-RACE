About the size of a microwave oven, it's pedestrian-friendly, too, waiting for book lovers next to a sidewalk in Palm Beach country Estates, along the northern boundary of Palm Beach Gardens.\n              It's a library built with love.\n              A year ago, shortly after Janey Henriksen saw a Brian Williams report about the Little Free Library organization, a Wisconsin-based nonprofit that aims to promote literacy and build a sense of community in a neighborhood by making books freely available, she announced to her family of four, \"That's what we're going to do for our spring break!\"\n              Son Austin, now a 10th-grader, didn't see the point of building a library that resembles  a mailbox. But Janey insisted, and husband Peter unwillingly got to work. The 51-year-old owner of a ship supply company modified a small wooden house that he'd built years earlier for daughter Abbie's toy horses, and made a door of glass.\n              After adding the library's final touches  , the family hung a signboard on the front, instructing users to \"take a book, return a book,\" and making the Henriksen library, now one of several hundred like it nationwide and among more than 2,500 in the world, the only Little Free Library in Palm Beach County. ks5u\n              They stocked  it with 20 or so books they'd already read, a mix of science fiction, reference titles, novels and kids' favorites. \"I told them, keep in mind that you might not see it again,\" said Janey, a stay-at-home mom.\n              Since then, the collection keeps replenishing   itself, thanks to ongoing donations from borrowers. The library now gets an average of five visits a day.\n              The project's best payoff, says Peter, are the thank-you notes left behind. \"We had no idea in the beginning that it would be so popular.\"  (317 words)", "id": "high16698.txt"}
