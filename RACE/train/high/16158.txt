He carried a paper bag. And four feet ducks could be seen under the cover. The man found an empty seat, put the bag in the middle of the floor, took out a newspaper and began to read. Then a policeman came in. Of course he saw the bag with ducks' legs at once and said, \"Whose is that bag?\" Nobody answered. The policeman repeated the question, and said, \"I'll have to take it away from the owner. Food mustn't be taken out of the country.\" \"Well, then,\" said the small man with a fat stomach. \"Hurry up and take it. We want to go home.\" The policeman took the bag and went on to the next carriage.\nAt the next station, when they were safely across the frontier, the small man got up, smiled at the other passengers and said, \"I hope they'll enjoy the ducks' feet. The rest of the bag had nothing but rubbish in it.\" Then he opened his coat and pointed to another bag he was carrying under it. It was tied tightly   over the stomach, which was not really fat. \"I have the rest of the two ducks here,\" he said. With these words, he got off the train. But while he was happily walking to the exit with the bag in his hands, a policeman came up to him, saying, \"Hey, man! Foreign food mustn't be brought in.\"", "id": "high16158.txt"}
