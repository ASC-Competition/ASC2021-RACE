Here's a great piece of writing reflecting parent's particular ways on the parenting style that have become known humorously as helicopter parenting and submarine   parenting.\nHelicopter parents  _ their children, managing every aspect of their child's life. On the contrary, submarine parents remain \"hidden\" coming to the surface when guidance is needed.\nWhile helicopter parents may have the best intentions, in reality, they are raising children with few problem solving skills. Children with hovering parents never get the chance to face disappointment and build up their ability to recover from misfortune.\nThink about your typical submarine. Submarines usually remain underwater. In case of a need for emergency surfacing, submarines can rise so quickly they are driven partially out of the water. Submarine parents also remain out of sight, yet able to pop up in the case of an emergency.\nI admit I'm a submarine mom.

She learned creativity. I saved $88.00.", "id": "high18194.txt"}
