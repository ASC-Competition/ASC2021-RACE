The reporter released the secret--Ma Ke.\nPeng Liyuan has been wearing Ma Ke's designs for more than a decade, a fact that was only highlighted recently when she was on her first state visit, accompanying her husband President Xi Jinping. The elegant and attractive Peng, formerly a popular singer, has been compared with the US' first lady Michelle Obama and France's Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, since stepping off the airplane in Moscow on March 22. Suddenly, everyone was curious to know more about the first lady's wardrobe.\nEven so, Ma prefers a low-key approach. _ she says of all the media attention.\nMa's relationship with Peng began 10 years ago after a concert in Guangzhou when a reporter told Peng she knew the designer behind the label Exception de Mixmind. Peng asked for an introduction because she was a fan of Ma's designs and had been wearing them for years.\nThe two naturally became friends. Ma says, \"The painting reflects the painter, and clothes reflect both the designer and the wearer. Someone desires fame and wealth, or love and sympathy; what you have in your heart is reflected in the design. Those who don't share my philosophy won't buy my clothes. Peng is a caring person, devoted to charity and environmental protection, which is exactly what I'm doing now.\"\nHowever, regardless of the brand, Peng's support of Chinese labels has surprised millions of Chinese who favor foreign fashion brands.\n\"Instead she presented a vision of Chinese fashion, desiring to bring Chinese designers to the world stage,\" says a western designer.\nThe first lady's double-breasted coat and her black leather handbag aren't available at any of Exception's shops, though Exception's physical stores do have seen a rising number of visitors.", "id": "high4751.txt"}
