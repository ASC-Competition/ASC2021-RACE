By the time he turned 30 in 1958,he was an unquestionable academic celebrity. At Princeton, Nash published a 27-page thesis that led to applications to economics, international politics, and evolutionary biology.\nHis signature solution-known as a \"Nash Equilibrium \"-found that competition among two opponents,not necessarily governed by zero-sum logic. Two opponents can, for instance,each achieve their maximum objectives through cooperating with the other, or gain nothing at all by refusing to cooperate. It is now regarded e, one of the most important social science ideas in the 20th century.\nIn the late 1950s, Nash began a slide into mental illness. By the time Nash was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994, he hadn't published a paper in 36 years. But like a child cured of a nightmare by the switch of a light, Nash recovered from his illness seemingly by choosing not to be sick anymore. He continued to work, travel,and speak at conferences for the rest of his life.\nIn 2001, the release of the film A Beautiful Mind,based an Sylvia Nasar's 1998 book of the same name, introduced Nash's unusual life story to an international audience.", "id": "high18935.txt"}
