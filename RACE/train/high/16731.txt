The answer is that you need to do so when you ask for a job.\nSome people believe that your blood group hides no secrets.It shows the \"real you\".And the owners of certain blood groups might be particularly good or bad at a certain task.This is the very reason why you could be asked to offer your blood group before being given a job.\nThe new idea was carried out first in Japan and now it has been brought over to other parts of the world.One important business company in Japan is quite special about these needs: \"For our office members, we must have 30 percent of those with group A and 15 percent with AB, 25 percent with B.\"\nDo you happen to know that if your own blood group is O, you can get things done and sell the goods well?
