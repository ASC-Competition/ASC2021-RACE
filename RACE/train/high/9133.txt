I learned the stereotypes of Mexicans: they are poor and lazy. I was ashamed of who I was because I am a Mexican and thought that it would be hard for me to be successful.\nOne day in the eleventh grade, we had a discussion in history class. The kid next to me said, \"You look like one of those Mexicans who sell food in the street.\" I told him that he was also a Mexican. He said, \"I don't look as Mexican as you. I have light skin.\" That was the first time that I'd heard someone say, \"I don't look as Mexican as you.\" Could it be that the people who succeed in this country are those who look like an American?\nTowards the end of the eleventh grade, I was asked to write a restaurant review. When I went to a restaurant, I saw the waiter talking to the chefs   and thought they were judging me. I felt nervous but I couldn't leave because I had to write the review. Minutes later, the waiter stopped talking and took my order. He was happy to serve me. I started asking him questions about his restaurant and I guessed that he liked that because he gave me a free dish. After I left the restaurant, I thought, \"That's wasn't bad at all.\" Not all people think of me as a failure.\nNow, I am running for the school president in my senior year. I am not sure if I can win, but I tell myself that if I want to be successful, I have to stop despising   myself. I want to prove that Latinos can be successful. I do belong to the United States. An American is a person who overcomes struggles to become successful and that is what I'm doing.", "id": "high9133.txt"}
