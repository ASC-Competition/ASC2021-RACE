The Senior 2 from Beijing No.35 High School dreamt of meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAfter more than a year of hard work and with a little good luck, Li fulfilled her dream. On October 11, 2004, the 16-year-old girl joined a team of Chinese journalists who went to the Kremlin, in Moscow, to interview Putin. \nLi felt nervous before talking with Putin. \"But his greeting and warm smile put me at ease,\" she said.\nLi admires Putin very much, because of his strong will and style of leadership. \"He looks very cool,\" Li said. During her interview, Li asked Putin whether he plans to educate his two teenage daughters to be officials in the future. Putin smiled and answered he hopes they can do whatever job suits their interests and personalities.\nAlthough Li would only have several minutes, she started working on her interview questions last August after applying for the opportunity. \"Journalists work is by no means easy. You need to do lots of homework on your  _ ,\" she said. She read many books about Putin and Russia in her spare time.\nLi's parents encouraged her to be a student journalist. \"We fully support her, as long as it does not affect her studies,\" said her father.
