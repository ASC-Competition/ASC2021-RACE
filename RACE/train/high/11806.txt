Hagen says, \"Basically,we've got porridge.We do occasionally get fresh produce but it's very rare,especially in the winter months.It's like tinned fruit,tinned ready meals.We have to give out 'no-cooking' food parcels because people can't afford the gas and electricity\".\nCommunity spirit has a lot to do with food banks.Volunteers say they are a great meeting place for people who are lonely and depressed.And when facing a crisis,some beneficiaries might need to feed not only their belly--but also their soul.", "id": "high11806.txt"}
