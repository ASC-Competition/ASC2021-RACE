For example,if in the past,someone in Dad' s family had been arrested for stealing a horse,it would be 'a skeleton in his family' s closet'.He really wouldn' t want any neighbor to know about it.\"\n\"Why pick on my family?\" Jessica' s father said with anger. \"Your family history isn' t so good,you know. Wasn' t your great-great-grandfather a prisoner who was transported to Australia for his crimes?\" \"Yes,but people these days say that you are not a real Australian unless your ancestors arrived as prisoners.\" \"Gosh,sorry I asked. I think I understand now,\" Jessica cut in before things grew worse.\nAfter dinner,the house was very quiet. Jessica' s parents were still quite angry with each other. Her mother was ironing clothes and every now and then she glared at her husband,who hid behind his newspaper pretending to read. When she finished, she gathered the freshly pressed clothes in her arms and walked to Jessica' s closet. Just as she opened the door and reached in to hang a skirt,a bony arm stuck out from the dark depths and a bundle of white bones fell to the floor. Jessica' s mother sank into a faint ,waking only when Jessica put a cold, wet cloth on her forehead. She looked up to see the worried faces of her husband and daughter.\n\"What happened?Where am I?\" she asked. \"You just destroyed the school' s skeleton,Mum,\" explained Jessica. \"I brought it home to help me with my health project. I meant to tell you,but it seemed that as soon as I mentioned skeletons and closets,it caused a problem between you and Dad.\" Jessica looked in amazement as her parents began to laugh madly. \"They' re both crazy,\" she thought.", "id": "high20043.txt"}
