If scientists are right, planet earth is 24 years away from a major disaster.\nScientists have been monitoring the progress of a 390-metre-wide asteroid ever since it was discovered last June. They have announced that it could hit the earth, causing huge damage, in 2036.\nNASA estimates that the impact from the asteroid named after Apophis and ancient Egyptian demon  would release more than 100,000 times the energy released in the nuclear explosion over Hiroshima. Thousands of square kilometers would be directly affected by the explosion. The whole planet would see the effects of the dust released into the atmosphere.\nThis is the worst possible scenario  of any asteroid in recorded history.\nHaving more than 20 years' warning of possible impact might seem plenty of time. But scientists insist that there is actually very little time left to decide.\nLuckily, however, they aren't short on ideas for\nthe asteroid. The favored method is also probably the easiest--throwing a spacecraft at the asteroid to change its direction. The European Space Agency plans to test this in the next decade.\nOne idea that seems to have no support from astronomers is the use of explosive, although this sounds more likely to the public or Hollywood producer.\nAt present, scientists are trying to make a better estimate of how much time we have, through more observations.\nIn spring of next year, there will be another chance for radar observation of Apophis. This will help astronomers calculate the orbits of the asteroid more accurately.\nIf, at that stage, they can't rule out an impact with the earth in 2036, the next chance to make better observations will not be until 2016, then 2029.\n\"If we wait until 2029 and the worst--case scenario turns out to be true, it would seem unlikely that we'd be able to do anything about 2036,\" warns Prof Fitzsimmons.", "id": "high15737.txt"}
