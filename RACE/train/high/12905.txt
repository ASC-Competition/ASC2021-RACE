While today's smartphones enable us to surf the Internet, take pictures and play music, their limited, sometimes annoyingly short battery life has started to make people full of memories of early models. \"My favorite phone of all time was a silver Nokia 6310i from the early 2000s. It may be primitive by today's standards, but it could run for 17 days on a single charge,\" wrote Daily Mail columnist David Derbyshire.\nBut scientists spend no time thinking about the past. They have built an aluminium   battery which could be a cheap, fast-charging alternative to current designs.\nYou can squeeze, and practically bend it in half without breaking the packet. It is more environmentally friendly than alkaline   batteries, and more safe than lithium   batteries - it won't catch fire \"even if you drill through it\", as Hongjie Dai of Stanford University told The Telegraph. The battery is the work of a team led by Dai. And the best part is that it has a recharge time of around one minute.\nHowever, at present, the only problem is that it produces just half the voltage   of a typical lithium battery. But Dai explained they were setting about changing the voltage and energy density \". \"Our battery has everything else you'd dream that a battery should have. I see this as a new battery in its early days,\" he told The Telegraph.", "id": "high12905.txt"}
