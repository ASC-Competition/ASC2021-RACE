From penguins to catfish  , some animal fathers play a big part in raising their babies. \n   \"Seahorses are possibly the best example of fathers caring for their young in the animal world,\" said Heather Masonjones, a biologist at the University of Tampa in Florida. Human mothers carry their babies in their bodies for nine months. But seahorses are different. A female seahorse lays eggs and then puts them in a pouch on a male seahorse's belly  , where the eggs stay until they hatch. \n    Male seahorses aren't the only animal dads caring for eggs. The male hardhead catfish carries up to 48 marble-\nsize eggs in his mouth for 60 days! He doesn't eat for the entire time. \"You'd think it would be hard for them to give up a meal,\" said Ed Matheson, a fish expert at the Florida Marine Research Institute. \n    Emperor penguins sit on eggs to hatch them during Antarctica's freezing winter. The males have to gather closely together for warmth and can lose half of their weight in the two months that it takes the baby penguins to hatch. \n    Even mammal   dads play a role in raising their young. The male South American marmoset   takes care of the baby in place of the mother a few weeks after she gives birth. \n    So next Father's Day, remember the millions of dads hard at work in the animal kingdom!", "id": "high17766.txt"}
