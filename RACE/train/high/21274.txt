That's because, in an effort to keep things from progressing slowly this summer, bosses at the London company are asking staff to sleep at work -- in space pods. Far from sleeping on the job, engineers will be asked to stay behind and sleep in the closed capsules to avoid the rush hour.\nAnd while other companies are planning to offer staff the luxury of working from home during the Games, the firm behind the capsules hopes to get more workplaces on board.\nPodtime, the firm behind the unusual cabins, are describing them as the perfect solution to the Olympics' crowded commute. On their official website they state 'London businesses will be severely affected by the transport problems caused by the Olympics.'\nReasonable prices and various pods provide the best solution to this by allowing your staff to stay on site as necessary, in comfort and privacy.
