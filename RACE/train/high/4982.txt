Many people believe that rickshaws are a good way of experiencing a city close-up, while also cutting down on traffic jams and pollution. In Berlin, one of the first cities to introduce this new model of transport, more than 200 bike-taxis go along at 15km per hour, past many tourist attractions and city parks.\n\"It is completely environmentally friendly; we have new models with an engine to help the driver up the hills but they use renewable energy.\" said a spokesman for VELOTAXI, the leading rickshaw company which has carried a quarter of a million people this year.\nWhile the city still has 7,000 motor-taxis, rickshaw company officials say their taxis' green ideas, speed and safety make them more than just a tourist attraction. While now increasingly out of fashion in Delhi, Berlin people have eagerly accepted the new fleet since their launch in 1997.\n\"It's better than a taxi, better than a bus, better than the train,\" said ULF Lehman, 36, as he leapt out of a rickshaw near the world famous Brandenburg gate. \"It feels so free.\"\n\" _ ,\" said another traveler.\nIn Amsterdam, driver Peter Jancso said people like to be driven around in his bright yellow rickshaw and pretend to be a queen in a golden carriage. \"I like my passengers to feel important,\" he said as he dropped off another passenger. Another visitor noted how cheap it was compared with a normal taxi.\nAlthough increasingly popular in Europe, it is the opposite in India, where hand-pulled rickshaws are considered inhuman and a symbol of India's backward past.\nNearly 500 bike-rickshaws are running in London and are not required to pay the city's road tax but things may change as other taxi drivers complain of unfair treatment.", "id": "high4982.txt"}
