Amy sets \"10 Rules\" for her two daughters. For instance, they've to get As in all subjects and play the piano or violin and practice hours every day.\nThere has been wide criticism  across the US. \"It's kind of extreme,\" said Jeffrey Seinfeld, a professor at New York University. \"Children need parents who can guide them, not force them...\"\nLawrence Solomon, a famous journalist for Canada's Globe and Mail, has quoted statistics to show the failure of Chinese parenting. He writes that only 10 Chinese scientists outside the Chinese mainland have won the Nobel Prize in the past century. In contrast, American scientists have won more than 300 Nobel prizes, and Jews , who take up only 1% of the world's population, have got at least 180 (or almost one-fourth) of the prizes.\nHowever, Amy's strict rules help her daughters shine in their studies. The elder sister is known for her piano presentation at the Carnegie Hall, and the younger boasts an excellent academic record.\nBesides, US statistics show that Chinese-Americans take up only 5% of the US population but 20% of the students in Ivy League schools .\nLikewise, Chinese-Canadians take up more than one-third of the students in Canada's two most famous universities, Toronto University and the University of British Columbia. Influenced by Confucius' teachings, students from Korea and Japan are also excelling in academic fields.\nTherefore, the Nobel Prize should not be taken as the _ of a country's education. No culture or tradition, whether Eastern or Western, is better or worse. The same applies to Eastern and Western education systems. Both sides should stop using their concepts and criteria to judge the other. They should learn the good aspects of each other's systems and clear the misunderstandings.", "id": "high7095.txt"}
