If many people eat too much fast food, you pay higher insurance bill.

It's fine when you're on the road and you need a cold drink, but people who buy cases of bottled water for home are completely crazy. \n                                                                                                       ----Agmlauncher\nI wish we all can find a way to improve things and benefit from this.
