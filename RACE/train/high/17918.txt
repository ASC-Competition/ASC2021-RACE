She placed a note on the kitchen table, picked up her bags, and then made her way to the bus stop. \n                 \"Hi, mum,\" she said after arriving at her house. \"What have you done?\" she asked, noticing Carrie's luggage in the hallway.  \"Oh, mum, I've left him. I couldn't bear any more.\" Shocked, her mum didn't know what to say, so she went to make some coffee.\n                               Next day, Carrie had a visitor. \"Carrie, please don't do this to me. Come back home?\" Tom begged. But was she listening? She ignored him and stepped back inside the house.  \nThe weeks went by and Tom became very depressed. There seemed little point in carrying on without her. Then one night he got into his car and drove to a nearby seaside town.  After abandoning the car, he walked towards a big stone by the sea. Looking over the edge he saw the waves crashing into the bottom of the rock. His body was shaking -- then he jumped.\n    Carrie was mad when she found out. She paced up and down smoking a cigarette. Her eyes were full of tears. It wasn't all his fault that he had become so bad tempered. He had been finding it difficult looking for another job. \n    She then threw the cigarette to the ground, wiped away the tears and made her way up the long passage and into a room. \"Don't you ever, ever do anything like that again,\"she said in a temper to the person in the room. \"I won't,\"Tom said, looking up at her from his hospital bed.         Luckily for him, someone had seen him jump and dived in to save him.", "id": "high17918.txt"}
