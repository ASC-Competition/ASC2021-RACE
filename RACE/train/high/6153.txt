We are sure that when we have plenty of money, we will be happy.\nWhile having some money does have an impact on our level of happiness, having a lot of money does not. It is reported that Americans whose income goes from $20,000 a year to $50,000 a year are more likely to be happy. But beyond $50,000, happiness does not increase as salaries go up. It is because we are never satisfied. Catherine Sanderson, a psychology professor at Amherst College says, \"We always think if we just had a little more money, we'd be happier. But when we get there, we are not.\"\nDaniel Gilbert, a psychology professor at Harvard notes,\"The more you make, the more you want. The more you have, the less it brings you joy. We incorrectly assume we'Il get more pleasure from more, and we don't.\"\nThe things money can buy don't make you happy either. A lot of research suggests that you won't find the \"good life\" buying expensive \"toys\". You finally buy that BMW you've always wanted and it soon loses its appeal. Then, instead of wondering if a new car is what really makes you happy, you decide you just need a different new car. It is an endless cycle.\nTo really be happy, you need to understand what makes you happy in the first place. One secret of happiness is people. Surveys have found that people need people. Those who have five or more close friends are 50% more likely to describe themselves as \"very happy\". Good relationships have a far greater effect on happiness than larger salary. Andrew Oswald, an economist at England's University of Warwick says, \"B you are looking for happiness in life, find the right husband or wife rather than trying to double your salary.\"\nSo invest your time and energy in people. The reward is much bigger in terms of happiness!", "id": "high6153.txt"}
