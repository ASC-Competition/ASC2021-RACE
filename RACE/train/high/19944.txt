In order to have friends, youhave to be a friend. You have to be with them in both good and bad times. In return, they will be there for you. But how can you be a good friend?\nListen. Listen when they are talking. Keep eye contact. Don't say anything unless they ask you a question. Sometimes you're not required to have anything to say; they just need someone to talk to about their feelings.\nHelp them. If your friends are ever in need of something, be there to help them. You should try to put them first, but make sure you don't become their slave  . Try to take an extra pencil or pen with you to classes as they may forget to take one.  Have a few extra dollars in your pocket in case they forget something they need.\nBe there for them. Try to make something for your friends to help make them feel better in hard times. Making cards and baking things are among the nicest things you can do for a friend when they are in hard times.  Marilyn Monroe once said,  \"I'm selfish,  impatient   and a little insecure.  I make mistakes, and I am out of control and at times hard to deal with. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you surely don't deserve   me at my best. \" Always remember this!  If you don't want to deal with your friends when they'redepressed, then you don't deserve to be with them during those parties where you have a good time!\nTry to make plans with your friends.  Go shopping, go for an ice cream, have a party, go to a movie and so on. Make time to know each other even better by doing something you both enjoy. These are the things you'll remember once you're all long graduated when looking back on your life !", "id": "high19944.txt"}
