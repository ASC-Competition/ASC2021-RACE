There were other comments, like a boy asking two other students in her class if they were Jewish. When they replied that they weren't, he said, \"Oh, good.\" Kaminer recalled. He patted them on their backs and said, \"You're one of us.\"\nKaminer, who is Jewish, said she was hurt by the remark, and after a while she got tired of seeing such comments swept under the rug . So she decided to take action.\nAfter reaching out to the administration and connecting with social studies department supervisor Stephen Armstrong, Kaminer and Armstrong put together a class on anti-Semitism. They presented it to every ninth-grade social studies class during the last week of school this year. In the class, Kaminer and Armstrong showed a clip from the ABC show, What Would You Do? where actors portrayed a Jewish couple and a bakery employee who yelled at them with anti-Semitic comments. They had class discussions about what stereotypes  students had heard.\n\"I was a little surprised and confused by how much of this still goes on at Hall.\" Armstrong said. \"That's why we're doing this. Although students are taught about the Holocaust   in history classes, it's a pity that kids are seldom asked to think about this topic in a present-day situation.\"\n\"The fact that a teenager was teaching her fellow students made the class more effective.\" Armstrong said. \"I could have done it - a couple of classes I did it myself - but it was a lot more effective when a kid was with me. It wasn't just some teacher talking. It was a kid who had experienced some of the stuff very personally.\"", "id": "high17607.txt"}
