Some students might need a while to remember. But for students in Yangzhou University it is easy to remember as they need to run in the morning at least three times a week during their two terms. The university even uses fingerprint punch-in clocks  to manage students' records. However, some students still try to skip  morning running. To them, sports are just not important enough.\nNow colleges are seeing a change in the student lifestyle from outdoor enthusiasts to indoor couch potatoes and Internet addicts. The Internet and various on-campus services, from food delivery to laundry, are leading to a student culture of staying in dormitories. A student can have every need met without leaving the dormitory.\nIn the past two years Zhang Yi, 20, a junior majoring in law at Yangzhou University, has never been outside for sports except during physical education class. \"I don't think there is anything wrong with sleeping late in the morning and wanting to stay in the dormitory in my spare time. I have more fun doing things on my computer than playing on the sports ground in wet clothes.\" said Zhang.\n\"With social networking sites, online games and micro-blogging added to already tight schedules, sports are often the last thing to be considered.\" said Cheng Jie, 21, a senior majoring in civil engineering at the Southeast University in Nanjing.\nBut Jin Yinghua, a professor at Beijing Sports University, said that sports are not only for keeping fit, but also an irreplaceable  \"education\" for students.
