Even shoes lost out. The study found 86 percent would prefer a new digital video camera to a pair of designer shoes.\nThe study found over the next five years women see themselves increasing their activities in six tech areas: digital cameras, cell phones, e-mail, camera phones, text-messaging and instant messaging. Laybourne said this increasing use of technology among women was expected to continue.", "id": "high22211.txt"}
