So he thought the land must be rich in gold. He named the place Costa Rica, which means \"rich coast\" in Spanish.\nThough little gold was found, Costa Rica today is indeed rich with coffee and bananas. Coffee is the most important product in Costa Rica and most of it is exported  to other countries like America and West Germany. Bananas are the country's second most important export.\nCosta Ricans also grow many other crops such as fruits, corn and beans for their own use. Costa Ricans love colors and their houses are painted in bright colors.\nEducation is very important to the Costa Ricans. Almost every village has a school and education is a must for children between seven and fourteen years of age. Boys and girls go to separate  schools. Classes begin in March and end in November. The other three months of the year are harvest time and the children have to help their parents to pick coffee beans.", "id": "high3820.txt"}
