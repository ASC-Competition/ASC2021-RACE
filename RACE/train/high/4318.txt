Florida chiropractor Dean Fishman began noticing an increased number of patients talking about neck and shoulder pain. He discovered these symptoms were due to the overuse of hand-held devices, particularly the action of bending the neck, and then _ the term \"Text Neck.\" As if the painful symptoms weren't bad enough, Fishman warns that an untreated case of Text Neck could lead to permanent spinal  damage.\nOther doctors have warned about \"iPad Hand,\" a condition that occurs when people use tablets like the iPad for hours at a time. Most people use their left hand to support the tablet and their right hand to tap or scroll. Doing this for long periods without changing positions can result in severe joint pain.\nIn order to avoid or reduce the possibility of getting Text Neck or iPad Hand, use the following basic ergonomic  principles:\nAvoid awkward positioning. Don't strain your neck, and stay aware of how you are positioned in relation to the device. Make sure that both your neck and shoulders are relaxed and that you aren't leaning over for a long period of time.\nTake frequent breaks when using any kind of mobile device. Many doctors recommend that users change their position every 15 minutes.\nWhen using a tablet, use a case that can support the device on a table or your lap at a comfortable viewing angle.\nAlong with a case, use a separate keyboard with your tablet. This will be more comfortable since you'll be resting both hands on the keyboard. And since you won't be holding the tablet, you'll be less likely to experience hand or arm pain.", "id": "high4318.txt"}
