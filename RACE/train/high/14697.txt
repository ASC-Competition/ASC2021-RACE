With the Internet, people now no longer need to be actors, sports stars or politicians to be famous.\nYou may still remember the time when Furong Jiejie, or Fengjie, appeared online. All of a sudden they were the talk of the town because of their crazy clothes and abnormal values.\nBut when the word wanghong, or \"Internet celebrity\", was named one of Yaowen Jiaozi magazine's \"popular cyber words\" in 2015, its meaning had changed. Those who are popular in the world of wanghong are largely famous for their heavily Photoshopped selfies  and the special lifestyles they advertise on social media.\nThe same thing is happening overseas as well. There are many women addicted to posting photos. This has led to the rise of \"Instagram Husbands\", men who are willing-or most likely forced-to take photos of their wives or girlfriends for their Instagram accounts.\nBut what wanghong offer their fans is much more than many pretty pictures. \"There is a longing for the effortless of life,\" commented China Youth Daily.\nThough their lifestyle may seem \"effortless\", some wanghong take great pains to run their Taobao stores, communicate with their fans and think of ways to keep their viewership , for example.\nZhang Dayi, a famous wanghong with over 4 million followers on Sina Weibo, revealed some of her secrets for attracting fans. \"Usually people look up to celebrities at a 45-degree angle. But I reduced that angle to 15 degrees, because no one likes to strain their necks too much,\" she said. Her social media strategies include being very kind to fans. \"As soon as you let down your guard, people will start to approach,\" she said.", "id": "high14697.txt"}
