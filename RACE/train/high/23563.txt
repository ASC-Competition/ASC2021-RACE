But eating organic food   could make you fat, experts have warned. A studyhas shown that people tend to believe that organic foods contain fewer calories, so buy and eat more. But people who decide to \"go organic\" could soon find themselves piling on the pounds.\nThe warning comes from American researchers who studied whether the sight of an organic label was enough to influence a person's choice. For example, if people believe organic foods, produced without using pesticides   and artificial fertilizers  , have fewer calories, they may end up eating far too much and spending less time on sports activities and put on weight. Cornell University researchers said: \" Some people mistakenly think that these foods are more nutritious  , just because they carry an organic label.\"\n\"The growing popularity of organic foods has led to some concern, as these foods may not necessarily be healthier than non-organic ones, but still may lead consumers to nutritional mis-judgments. If people feel a food to be more nutritious, they tend to let their guard down when it comes to counting calories---in the end leading them to overeat.\"\nAlthough a small number of differences in nutrient content were found to exist between organically-produced crops and traditionally-produced ones, these are of little health importance. It shows that there is no proof to support the choice of organically over traditionally-produced foods because of nutritional advantage.", "id": "high23563.txt"}
