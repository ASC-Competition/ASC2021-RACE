For handsome men,the extra kicks are more likely to come from economic benefits,like increased wages, while women are more likely to find joy just looking in the mirror. \"Women feel that beauty is naturally important,\" says Daniel Hamermesh,a University of Texas at Austin labor economist and the study's lead author. \"They just feel bad if they're ugly.\"\nHamermesh is the acknowledged father of pulchronomics, or the economic study of beauty. It can be a dangerous job. He once made angry an audience of young Mormon  women, many of whom wished to stay home with future children, by explaining that homemakers tend to be less attractive than their working-girl peers . \"Since beautiful women tend to be paid more,they have more motivation to stay in the work force,\" he says.\nThe pursuit of good looks drives several huge industries--in 2010, Americans spent  $845 million on face-lifts alone--but few economists focused on beauty's financial power until the mid-1990s,when Hamermesh and his colleague, Jeff Biddle of Michigan State University, became the first scholars to track the effect of appearance on earnings potential for a large sample  of adults. Like many other desirable commodities , \"beauty is rare,\"  Hamermesh says, \"and that rareness commands a price.\"\nA handsome man is estimated to make 13 percent more during his career than a \"looks-challenged\" peer, according to calculations in Hamermesh's recent book, Beauty Pays. Interestingly, the net benefit is slightly less for pretty women, who may make up the difference by trading on their looks to marry men with higher earning potential. And some studies have shown that attractive people are more likely to be hired in a recession .\nHamermesh argues that \"there's not much we can do to improve our pulchritude \". There are even studies suggesting that for every dollar spent on cosmetic  products,only 4 cents returns as salary--making lipstick a truly awful investment.\n _ . One 2006 study showed that the less beautiful may actually profit from their lack of looks. People tend to expect less from the unattractive, so when they go beyond those low expectations they are rewarded. And the beautiful ones are often primarily  held to a higher standard-- \"then hit with a 'beauty penalty'  if they fail to deliver.\" Hamermesh says.", "id": "high23651.txt"}
