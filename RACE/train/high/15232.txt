Roy wasn't the only one to receive his call-up papers.Stephen Napier's call-up came at the beginning of February and he was pleased to find that he would be going into the Royal Air Force (RAF).\nHis father was not so pleased and made his feelings known as he and Stephen were on their daily walk.

Brochures about emigration .\"\nThe big, silvered head lowered, _ .\"Don't trouble to deny it.\"\n\"I won't, Father. Some men at Cambridge have been talking about it.

You've got an estate to run. I never asked for it. Why not ask Baden to do this stuff?
