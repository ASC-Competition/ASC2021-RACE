Although many people see this as a successful attempt to bring people closer to the computer. David does not see _ that way. He says that Computertown UK was formed for just the opposite reason, to bring computers to people and make them \"people-literate.\" David Tebbutt thinks Computertowns are most successful when tied to a computer club but he insists there is an important difference between the two. The clubs are for people who have some computer knowledge already. This frightens away non-experts, who are happier going to Computertowns where there are computers for them to experiment on, with experts to encourage them and answer any questions they have. They are not told what to do, they find out.The computer experts have to learn not to tell people about computers, but have to be able to answer all questions people ask. People don't have to learn computer terms , but the experts have to explain in plain language. The computers are becoming \"people-literate.\"", "id": "high734.txt"}
