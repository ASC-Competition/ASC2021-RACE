It is our job to look for the best educational programs. One of the most important things of a good child care program or child day care is the teacher to child ratio  . It means that every student needs a certain amount of attention in order to grow and learn correctly.\n              It's for this reason that small-sized class in schools are leading to bigger and better opportunities. With smaller classes, each student is given personal attention when it comes to their class work, their personal health and their mental growth.\nWhen there are too many children in a class, individuals get lost in the crowd. They always couldn't get enough attention. When it comes to the educational result, they don't learn well because some are afraid to ask questions in front of so many people. Others become lazy for not having been attended by the teacher.\n              Some schools are overcrowded these days. Most children don't even get their basic educational work done in schools. How is one expected to grow into a successful , healthy adult if the basics are not done? For these and several other reasons, schools with small class sizes are turning out to be very good for children.\n              Diana Autumn is Director of Anne Sullivan School. The excellent teachers here often attend different courses and workshops to stay on top of the latest research in education, and the school pays more attention to its interactive   classrooms and small-sized classes.", "id": "high24027.txt"}
