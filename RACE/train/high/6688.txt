In the movie, the two heroes, Dunzi and Yanjing, who are in middle school, visit a video games room on the street each day after school.\nBut why make a short movie about video games, since there are lots to write about childhood, such as puppy love, sports and study? \"Playing games is so important to everyone's childhood from little kids to teenagers, though it's a bittersweet experience,\" said Zhan. According to him, his teachers and parents didn't allow video games, but they played games \"under their noses \" anyway.\nIn the movie, the two playmates follow different paths after school. Dunzi opens a small store selling gaming products. Yanjing works as a manager in his father's company, After years of working and facing various problems in life, they get together again, build a video game machine and play on the street. Free, simple and happy. They rediscover the carefree childhood, which they have lost in the adult world.\nMany consider playing games as a bad influence, but it isn't all true, according to Zhan. \"It can change your attitude toward life,\" said Zhan. \"On the other hand, the movie also tells you that, although the world of video games is fun, you must face real life at the end of the day. \"", "id": "high6688.txt"}
