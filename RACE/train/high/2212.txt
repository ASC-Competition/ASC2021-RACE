Bake sales have proven to be highly profitable toward schools with young people because the start-up costs are very small. Allie,a Roslyn High School freshman , agrees that bake sales are needed for school supplies.\"l think it's wrong for schools to ban bake sales because a lot of schools need the money to be raised. Our school could really use the money for new uniforms.\"Allie also commented on the bake sales apparent cause of child overweight. \"I feel that it is the student's choice to eat the baked goods. lf they want it, let them have it.\"Jessica,another Roslyn High School freshman, had a different opinion.\"I feel that children can not always stay away from items such as cupcakes.

A plan of advertising healthier foods has come into play. However the department needs to consider if students will go for items like vegetables. Allie and Jessica don't think so.\"Students might not like the healthier foods. This way, the schools are gaining less money.\"Allie shares. Another plan to think about is the idea of not selling food products altogether.
