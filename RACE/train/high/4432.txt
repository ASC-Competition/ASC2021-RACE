He became well-known for sleeping around the neighbourhood and used to nap in the spare bedroom of elderly couple who lived three doors up from us.While I wasn't always aware of all his liaisons, it didn't matter as long as he always came home at mealtimes.\nOne day we noticed he had gained weight. We guessed he was enjoying snacks at the local takeaway shop bins and so we began to reduce the amount of his food. He didn't seem to notice.\nSome months later. we invited some new neighbours in for drinks. Not long into the evening, our new neighbor saw PJ sitting proudly on the window ledge. \"You've got my cat!\" She exclaimed, laughing.\nWe let her down gently, and learnt that at their house, PJ was known as Tiger. Thanks to them, he'd been receiving the royal treatment, including removing small insects from his body by spraying medicine. PJ continued living with us until a new cat and a new dog finally tested his patience. _ walked out and was missing for ten days before my husband spotted him near his work. He brought our wandering cat home, but it was clear that PJ wasn't happy.

The two had become very fond of each other, ever since he'd followed her home. What a smart cat.", "id": "high4432.txt"}
