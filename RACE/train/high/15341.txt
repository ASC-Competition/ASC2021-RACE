And once they're gone, there is no trace   that they were ever there.\nThe special paint is said to last for at least three years after it is first applied, but there is no word yet on whether more can be added after that period.\nNissan claims car washes are the worst offenders for this type of damage, accounting for at least 80 percent of all incidents.\nBut the complete auto-healing won't come without scratching your wallet.
