So, I'd like to try to say something about them. \n         Due to the nation's family planning policy, usually a couple only has a kid. Young father and mother pay much attention to the smooth and healthy growing of their baby even when it is still in its mother's womb  . So, traditionally speaking, most of the kids have quite higher IQ. The difference of IQ between kids are quite limited. \n    As EQ is concerned, I think the later experience of a kid in the society (home, schools, companies etc.) is of vital importance to shape his or her character. Even two kids have similar IQ, there could be a larger gap between their EQs if they have varied life experience. \n    What kind of people could be more possible to succeed? No doubt, the type of people with quite good combination of IQ and EQ! In my opinion, higher EQ at least includes the following aspects: 1. The ability to stand difficulty and setbacks; 2.

Those talented graduates from famous colleges and universities couldn't achieve a lot if they don't know how to get along well with their colleagues! Individualism is far away from success in the integrated world. Team work needs cooperation consciousness which is an important element of EQ. \n    To be honest, I still have a long way to go to improve my EQ to perfect myself!
