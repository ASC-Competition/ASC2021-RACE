The ancient Greek poet Homer called old age \"hateful\", and William Shakespeare termed it \"terrible winter\".\nAlexander the Great, who conquered most of the known world before he died around 323 B.C., may have been looking for a river that healed the\nof age. During the 12th century A.D., a king called Prester John ruled a land that had a river of gold and a fountain of youth.\nBut the name linked most closely to the search for a fountain of youth is 16th-century Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon. He thought it would be found in Florida. In St. Augustine, the oldest city in the U.S., there's a tourist attraction. It is said to be the fountain of youth that Ponce de Leon discovered soon after he arrived in what is now Florida in 1513. However, elderly visitors who drink the spring's water don't turn into teenagers.\nBut the tale of the search for a fountain of youth is so appealing that it survives anyway, says Ryan K. Smith, a professor of history. \"People are more attracted by the story of looking and not finding than they are by the idea that the fountain might be out there somewhere.\"\nStill, a few grains of truth have helped to support\n. Kathleen Deagan, a professor of archaeology, says a graveyard and the remains of a Spanish mission dating back to St. Augustine's founding in 1565 have been discovered near the so-called fountain of youth. Michelle Reyna, a spokesperson for the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park in St. Augustine, says the fountain has been a tourist attraction since at least 1901 and may have been attracting visitors since 1860.", "id": "high16396.txt"}
