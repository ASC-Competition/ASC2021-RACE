That is the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT, an American test for students who intend to apply for college admission.\nChen Huanlu, aged 18, from Shandong Province took part in the SAT subject tests (SAT 2) in Hong Kong on June 2. She has also been scheduled to take the SAT reasoning test (SAT 1) in October.\n\"I hope to study environmental engineering at an American university, where I may have more opportunities to get cutting-edge   knowledge in this area,\" said Chen.\nHowever, not all SAT test takers want to apply to American universities.\n\"I wanted to see how I would do when faced with plenty of stress and also to evaluate   my scholastic level by an American standard. The SATs made my school life more diverse,\" said Senior 2 student Zhou Yuxiang from Sichuan Province.\nZhou, aged 17, a top student in his school, was inspired by some of his friends. They have taken this test and been admitted to American universities, including Harvard and Yale. Last winter vacation he took a 20-day SAT course at Chengdu New Oriental School.\n\"As I prepared for the test in the following months, I was forced to balance my everyday schedule better. Fortunately I was optimistic enough to have undergone the most difficult time,\" he said.\nIn May and June, Zhou flew alone to Hong Kong to sit for the SAT1 and SAT2.\n\"They are both the standards which have been set for us to reach. What we should do more sensibly is to try harder to prepare for them. Survival of the fittest   is true both in America and in China. That is something I have learnt beyond the SAT itself,\" he said.", "id": "high14816.txt"}
