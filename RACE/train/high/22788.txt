Spielberg based his film on parts ofTeam of Rivals, a book by Doris Kearns Goodwin. He makes Abraham Lincoln relevant today by presenting a cunning political mind trying to overcome Washington's all too familiar political divisions.\nIn previous movies, Lincoln was shown as a simple yet almost perfect man. But Spielberg's Lincolnis different. \"I was determined to make a movie about a working president dealing with real problems. Not some angel,\" Spielberg said.\nWe watch the president first ending slavery and then the war.\nThe film's adviser, historian Eric Martin, explains how Lincoln's thinking evolved.\n\"His main objective when the war began was not the freeing of the slaves but to keep the country united. Lincoln realizes that in order to keep the country together, the question of slavery will have to be addressed,\" Martin said.\nThe film focuses on the last four months of his presidency.\nIn the movie, the arguments among political enemies seem very similar to the problems we see in Washington today. The disagreements were bitter.\nThe film turns to Lincoln's relationships with his wife and kids, his beliefs and constant self-examination. Daniel Day-Lewis, the actor who plays Lincoln, offers an Oscar-worthy performance as the 16th President. Not only is his physical similarity to the president incredible, he is able to capture many of Lincoln's mannerisms and his high-pitched, almost lady-like voice.  \n\"I found it very easy to play the role of Lincoln because the real man himself was so open.  When I was researching his history to prepare for the part, one of the most surprising things I found was just how accessible he was. Even in war-time, when he was in great danger, he was always willing to meet with others and share his ideas,\" Day-Lewis said.\nSpielberg's Lincolnwill head to the Oscars. But more important it will make history.", "id": "high22788.txt"}
