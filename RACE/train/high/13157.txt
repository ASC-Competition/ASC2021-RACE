And that, scientists said, means an increased flood risk, particularly for the world's driest areas. The study challenges the idea that global warming is causingdry areas to become drierand wet areas wetter.\n\"In both wet and dry regions, we see these great increases in heavy precipitation ,\" lead author Markus Donat, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, told Nature.\nDonat and his team collected data from 1951 to 2010 on extreme precipitation events from 11, 000 weather stations around the world, Nature reported.\nIn that time, the number of days with \"extreme precipitation\" increased 1 percent to 2 percent per decade.\n\"We found a strong relationship between global warming and an increase in rainfall, particularly in areas outside of the tropics,\" Donatsaid in a statement.\n\"Importantly, this research suggests we will see these extreme rainfall events increases at regional levels in dry areas, not just as an average across the globe,\" Donat added.\nPeter Stott, a senior climate scientist at Met Office, told Climate Central that the study's findings are important, because more violent rainfall and flooding will \"challenge our capability to adaptto a rapidly changing climate.\"\nAs Nature reported, the research aligns witha 2015 study that found global warming has led to a sharp increase in record-breaking precipitation events. Donat told Nature that his study should come as a warning to world governments.", "id": "high13157.txt"}
