J. Lo went triple-platinum.\" What does this mean about the album?"], "article": "Coming from the Bronx, Jennifer Lopez knew from an early age it would be tough to achieve her dream. In an interview in 2002 she remembered, \"I had such a will in me. I had such a passion in me. I could overcome my situation. But a lot of people will get beaten down and be held back by that.\" Lopez was not beaten by her situation. She worked hard dancing, singing, and acting in theaters and her hard work paid off with small roles in television and films.\nLopez's big breakthrough came in 1996 when she played the main role in the movie Selena. For this movie, Lopez got paid $1 million and became the highest paid Latin actress of all time. Since then, she has had starring roles in several successful movies, including Out of Slight(1998) with George Clooney.\nThen, Lopez turned her attention toward music. In 1999, she released first album, On the 6. Two songs from the album, \"If You Had My Love\" and \"Waiting for Tonight,\" both reached number one on the Billboard music charts. The album sold more than three million copies around the world.\nAfter starring in The Cell (2000), Lopez released her second album, J. Lo, in 2001. The album went straight to the top of the Billboard chart. At the same time that her album came out, Lopez's new movie, The Wedding Planner, opened in theaters. It became the number one movie at the box office. This meant that Lopez was the first entertainer to ever have a number one album and a number one movie at the same time! Like her first album, J. Lo went tripe-platinum.\nBut her entertainment career was not the only thing Lopez focused on that year. 2001 was also the year Lopez started her own line of clothing, called J.Lo, and she married Cris Judd, a dancer who performed in her videos. The marriage did not last long, and Lopez and Judd divorced nine months later.\nIn 2002, Lopez starred in the films Enough and Maid in Manhattan. Maid in Manhattan became Lopez's biggest movie yet, earning $19 million during its first weekend in theaters. Lopez also put her third album, This Is Me... Then, and the single \"Jenny from the Block\" hit number one for a week. To go with her line of clothing, Lopez introduced her own perfume.\nIn an interview, Lopez was asked if she planned to do more acting, singing, designing, or something new. She answered, \"Yes, yes, yes, and yes! All of those things. I love making music, I love doing movies and all the other things. I think that everyone should do everything that they have a passion for.\"", "id": "high20502.txt"}
