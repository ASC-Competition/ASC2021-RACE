He found himself in trouble about half-a-mile from the shore and dangerously close to rocks. Surfers Graig Evans, 31, Robert Miles, 19, and Owain Daviees, 23, were risking their own safety to keep him floating for 30 minutes. Luckily a passer-by noticed what was going on and raised the alarm. Porthcawl Coastguard, Porthcaw Lifeboat and an RAF helicopter all took part in the rescue. \n\"The man who got into trouble was a body boarder-there was a big tide where he was,\" said Joe Missen. \"Three other surfers spotted he was in difficulty and he was going down. They kept him afloat because he was in a state of shock and out of energy. If Mr. Popple was closer to the rocks, it could have been a lot worse, but they managed to keep him from harm\".\nMr. Missen's mum Alison, also part of the rescue team, said, \"That part of the water is notorious for taking people out to nowhere\".\nThe three men had clocked off a night shift at Ford Motor Company shortly before the incident. \n\"I headed straight down to the beach for a surf, when I saw him flailing . We just swam straight out to him and kept him calm while the help came\".\nThe four men were taken to the life boat house to recover, without injuries.", "id": "high22253.txt"}
