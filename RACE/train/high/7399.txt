According to a pioneer in nonverbal communication, only 30 to 35 percent of our communication is verbal. When people don't know the language, the most common way to communicate is through gestures. However, many gestures have different meanings, or no meaning at all, in different parts of the world.\nIn the United States, for example, nodding your head up and down means \"yes\". In some parts of Greece and Turkey, however, this motion can mean \"no\". In Southeast Asia, nodding your head is a polite way of saying \"I've heard you\".\nIn ancient Rome, when the emperor wanted to spare someone's life, he would put his thumb up. Today in the United States, when someone puts his / her thumb up, it means \"Everything is all right\". However, in Sardinia and Greece, the gesture is insulting and should not be used there.\nIn the United States, raising your clasped hands above your head means \"I'm the champion\" or \"I'm the winner\". It is the sign prizefighters make when they win a fight. When a leading Russian statesman  made this gesture after a White House meeting, Americans misunderstood and thought he meant he was a winner. In Russia, however, it is a sign of friendship.\nIn the United States, holding your hand up with the thumb and index finger in a circle and the other three fingers spread out means \"Everything is O.K.\" and is frequently used by astronauts and politicians. In France and Belgium, it can mean \"You're worth nothing.\"\nThere are other nonverbal signals that people should be aware of when they go to another country, such as the distance to maintain between speakers. Americans usually feel comfortable when speaking with someone if the distance between them is about eighteen inches to arm's length. Anything closer makes them feel uncomfortable.\nWhen talking to Americans, it is also important to make eye contact. If you look down when talking to an American, he / she may feel that you are embarrassed, afraid, or trying to hide something.\nIn addition to knowing how to communicate nonverbally in a country, it is important to know what you and he cannot discuss. In the United States, there are certain topics to avoid when you first meet someone, For example, don't ask people their age, weight, religion, marital status , how much money they earn, or how much something costs. You can talk about work, the weather, traffic problems, sports, food, news of the day, where one lives, consumer subjects (computers, car repairs, and so forth), and travel or vacation plans.\nThese few examples illustrate that your actions can speak louder than your words. In a particular cultural contest, what you say and what you don't say are equally important.", "id": "high7399.txt"}
