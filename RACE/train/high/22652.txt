Parents are more likely to give us our freedom if they trust us. If you want your parents to trust you more, you have to show them through your actions.\n   Let your parents know what's going on at school and with your friends. If you truly can be trusted, then you have nothing to hide, right? Keep your bedroom door open when you are back. Do not be crazy when they see what you are looking at on the Internet. Invite your friends to your house to meet your parents.\n   When you do something wrong, it can break trust. Broken trust takes a long time to rebuild.\n   It's not easy dealing with your parents when you've broken their trust. But, it can be done. It's not talking about groveling and sweet-talking them into trust. I'm talking about getting them to respect you again.\n   I find it easy to make the mistake of no telling my parents things I've done wrong, hoping they won't find out. There are lots of reasons:\n   I don't want to get into trouble;\n   I don't want them to be disappointed or get mad at me;\n   I don't want to lose their trust;\n   I don't think they will ever find out.\n   And the list goes on and on. But they find out somehow, and then you're in hot water. Of course, even if Mom and Dad never find out, you still know about.\n   Most parents will respect you more for coming to them and telling them yourself. Doing so shows honesty, responsibility and maturity . If you can't tell them face to face, you can try writing a note.\n   Trust can't be built in a day or even a week, but you can gradually do things to help your parents build trust in you.", "id": "high22652.txt"}
