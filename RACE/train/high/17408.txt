At this location,another group of children is focusing on the diary of a woman who lived in the region during the war.Student director John Ashley says the experience has made him think more about the human aspect of the war.Filmmaker Ghil Hong donated his time to help the students, who have understood it quickly.\"They are trying to convey the emotions during the Civil War.They really focus on wanting the story to be accurate,''Hong added.\n    With help from advisors,the children also research,write,and edit the videos.Alexis Albert got a chance to try out directing and learned a lot about Civil War history in the process. \"It helps me more as a student understand it more than reading a book and looking at words,\"he said.\n    The project is sponsored by the Journey Through Hallowed Ground,which raises  awareness of historical sites from Pennsylvania to Virginia,  including many Civil War battlegrounds.", "id": "high17408.txt"}
