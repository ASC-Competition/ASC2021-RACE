But the researchers say there may be an easy way to stop unhealthy snacking   in front of the television: put healthier food within easy reach.\n  Leah Lipsky and Ronal Iannotti are the scientists who worked on the study, which was reported this week in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine. The report says that for every hour of television children watch, they are 8% less likely to eat fruit every day, 18% more likely to eat candy, and 16% more likely to eat fast food.\n  The reasons for the link   between watching TV and eating junk food aren't surprising: young people watching TV are exposed to more advertising for unhealthy food-such as fast food-than commercials   for fresh fruit and vegetables. Studies show that children who watch a lot of TV are more likely to prefer eating things that are high in sugar, salt and fat, even when they aren't watching TV.\n  The researchers also found that some children who snacked in front of the television, however, increased the amount of fruit that they ate.
