Holiday eaters were urged to \"clean their plates\" and were asked to take leftover food home in \"doggy bags.\"\nThe impetus behind the campaign was the startling government statistic that over 200 billion yuan is spent every year on food that ends up in the garbage bin. And in the midst of all this waste, statistics show that 128 million people are living below the poverty line and going hungry.\nThe \"clean your plate\" campaign is part of a worldwide effort to stop precious food from being wasted. The United Nations estimates that $1trillion (yes, that's a very big number) worth of food is wasted each year. Most of that is lost during food production and transportation, but a significant percentage is attributed to waste by consumers. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has launched a campaign called \"Think. Eat. Save.\" to make people aware of the problem.\nChinese actress Fan Bingbing is an ambassador for UNEP and she encouraged people to upload pictures of their \"clean plates\" to show their support for the program. Thousands of people responded and demonstrated that they had a clear conscience to go along with their full stomachs.\nXi Jinping, the incoming Chinese president, is also urging people to be less wasteful and he told Party members to cut back on extravagant holiday banquets and to be more careful when spending the people's money.\nFor some, though, Xi Jinping's and Fan Bingbing's admonitions don't go far enough. Yuan Longping, an agricultural scientist, caused a stir by saying that wasting food should be treated as a crime. (Jail time for leftover chicken feet!?)\nIf not a crime, wasting food is certainly a sin and it goes against what Xi Jinping calls, \"the Chinese tradition of being diligent and thrifty.\" Having a \"clean plate\" is just a traditional and responsible thing to do.", "id": "high2692.txt"}
