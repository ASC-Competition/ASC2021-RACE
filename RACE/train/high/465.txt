For weeks my mother had helped me practice my lines. But once on stage, every word disappeared from my head. Then my teacher told me she had written a narrator's part for the play, and asked me to change roles. Though I didn't tell my mother what had happened that day, she sensed my unhappiness and asked if I wanted to take a walk in the yard. It was a lovely spring day. We could see dandelions popping through the grass in bunches, as if a painter had touched our landscape with bits of gold. I watched my mother carelessly bend down by one of the bunches. \"I think I am going to dig up all these weeds,\" she said. \"From now on, we'll have only roses in this garden.\" \"But I like dandelions,\" I protested. \"All flowers are beautiful-even dandelions!\" My mother looked at me seriously. \"Yes, every flower gives pleasure in its own way, doesn't it?\" she asked thoughtfully. I nodded. \"And that is true of people, too,\" she added. When I realized that she had guessed my pain, I started to cry and told her the fact. \"But you will be a beautiful narrator,\" she said, reminding me of how much I loved to read stories aloud to her. Over the next few weeks, with her continuous encouragement, I learned to take pride in the role. The big day finally came. A few minutes before the play, my teacher came over to me. \"Your mother asked me to give this to you,\" she said, handing me a dandelion. After the play, I took home the flower, laughing that I was perhaps the only person who would keep such a weed.", "id": "high465.txt"}
