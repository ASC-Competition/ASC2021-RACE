All of us are cutting math. Who wants to take that quiz? We're going to take a walk and get lunch instead. Let's go!\" says the coolest kid in your class. Do you do what you know is right and go to math class, take the quiz? Or do you give in and go with them?\nPeople who are at your age, like your classmates, are called peers. When they try to influence you how to act, to get you to do something, it's called peer pressure. It's something everyone has to deal with--even adults.\nPeers influence your life, even if you don't realize _ , just by spending time with you. You learn from them, and they learn from you. It's only human nature to listen to and learn from other people in your age group.\nPeers can have a positive influence on each other. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in the solar system. Or you got others excited about your new favorite book, and now everyone is reading it. Sometimes peers influence each other in negative ways. For example, a few kids in school might try to get you to cut class with them.\nIt's difficult to say \"no\" to peer pressure, but you can do it. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do.\nIt can really help to have at least one other peer, or friend, who is willing to say \"no\" too. If you continue to face peer pressure and you're finding it difficult to handle, talk to someone you trust, a parent, or a teacher. They can help you feel much better and prepare you for the next time you face peer pressure.", "id": "high8728.txt"}
