It has been designed to encourage more people to cycle in and around central London.\nSo how does it work?First you have to sign up to the scheme to be sent a key. The key will unlock one of the bikes, which are kept at docking stations   in and around central London. You have to pay an access fee for the key and then you pay as you go, for the length of time you use the bike.\nTransport for London, which runs the scheme, are hoping to have 6,000 bikes and 400 docking stations in place by the end of the year. The new hire system is hoping to ease traffic jams in London and is expected to create up to 40,000 extra cycle trips a day into the city centre. London Mayor Boris Johnston launched the scheme and said London has been \"filled with thousands of gleaming   machines that will transform the look and feel of our street and become as commonplace on our roads as black cabs and red buses\".\n                However, there have been a few problems since the scheme was launched last Friday. On the first day some people found they couldn't dock their bike properly and their usage of the bike had not registered.\nTransport for London did admit they had been expecting a few \"teething problems\" and have said they would not charge for the first day as a \"gesture of goodwill\". Some other people have criticized the lack of docking stations and locks for the bikes as well as the price it costs to hire the bicycles.\nDespite the comments, the green-thinking London Mayor still says with certainty, \"My crusade for the capital to become the greatest big cycling city in the world has taken a great pedal-powered push forwards.\"", "id": "high18805.txt"}
