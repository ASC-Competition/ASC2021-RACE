On May 17, she attended the 2015 Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas, US, with pink hair and a blue coat. She looked like a model, but won big as a rapper. The 24-year-old Australian beat out big names like Nicki Minaj and Drake to win the award for Top Rap Artist.  \nIt's a great achievement in many people's eyes, but Azalea knew what she wanted from the beginning. At 15 she dropped out of high school because she was only interested in art class. She worked as a house cleaner to save money for her dream the following year. Before her 16th birthday, Azalea left her home, a tiny town in Australia, for the US, making up her mind to become a rapper. Moving from Miami to Houston to Atlanta, she started rapping in the Southern-style accent of her surroundings and her single \"Ignorant Art\" came out in 2011. From then on, she has never looked back.\nHowever, her style has caused lots of discussions. She might be one of the most polarizing artists. She raps with a southern American accent, even though she speaks with an Australian one. Many people comment that she overuses black culture in her music.\nHer supporters are against it. Female American rapper MC Lyte defended Azalea in an interview, saying she should not be judged because of where she's from. \"Hip hop is universal, no color1 lines.\" MC Lyte said. Azalea herself is proud of her music. \"I really want to be focused on what I'm doing,\" she said in an interview.\"That's really dangerous when you're trying to figure out ways to entertain people and make them happy. I don't want to be a part of that.\"", "id": "high18870.txt"}
