After China officially confirmed that it is planning an aircraft carrier program by announcing a refitting  project of an imported aircraft carrier for the purposes of scientific research and training, some voices overseas expressed concern that China's possession of an aircraft carrier could upset the regional and global strategic balance.\n   At present, China is only making use of an old aircraft carrier platform for scientific research, experiments and training, and it still will take a long time before the country actually has an operational carrier, said the commentary signed by Peng Guangqian.\n    Even when China has a carrier, it will stick to the defensive nature of its defense policy, the commentary said, adding that China has plenty of reasons and legitimacy   to have an aircraft carrier. China is currently the only country without an operational aircraft carrier among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. Other countries, including Spain, Italy, India, Brazil and Thailand also have carriers. This situation does not  _ China's international status, the commentary said. Another article said a carrier will help promote Chinese citizens' awareness of maritime   affairs, increase the capability  to safeguard the country's maritime interests as well as the capability to participate in international maritime joint   operations, such as salvage, counterterrorism and piracy crackdowns, it said.", "id": "high21518.txt"}
