There is a distance of about 100 feet between the boat and the workers on the bridge overhead. The rest of Terry's fellow workers are up on the bridge working. Terry's job is to rescue anyone who falls off the bridge into the water. So far, no one has given him anything to do .Although he's delighted that none of his companions has fallen into the water, he also admits that the job is very boring because there is nothing to do.\nNo one on the work crew really wants duty on the boat. But the job is a union requirement, and it must be filled. To quality for the job, a person must be an excellent swimmer and have training in lifesaving skills. Only a few men on the work crew meet those standards. Before Terry took the boat job, several others had it and gave up because they found it so tedious. \nWhat does Terry do in his little boat all day? He spends a good bit of time making sure that his suntan lotion is adequate for the job of protecting his skin. He reads and listens to the radio .Each day he looks forward to lunch and then to quitting time.", "id": "high22205.txt"}
