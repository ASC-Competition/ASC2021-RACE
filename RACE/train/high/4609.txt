The bank clerk nodded and I sat in front of him.  He was busy filling up entries in his register.\nI put my form and booklet in front of him.After waiting for a few more minutes, in which I showed all signs of being impatient, I asked him if my work was done. He shouted, \"Nothing is done, and it will take time ! \"\nJust then I saw his morning cup of tea, which had been lying there for the last ten minutes, untoucheD.The tea had turned almost cold while he was doing his work.Suddenly I felt what this man must be feeling  when customers like me come always in a hurry to get their work done.
