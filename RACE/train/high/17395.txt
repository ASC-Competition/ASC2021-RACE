The young chef with Belle-Vue, the European restaurant at the Grand Hyatt Shenzhen, believes a chef has to be honest and true to his food. \n\"If you look at the plate, it says exactly what I have done. You cannot cheat. If you try to take a shortcut, you will affect the taste,\" he says. \"It is also what I appreciate in my job ---- direct communication with my customers.\" \nAt just 23, Briol was appointed chef of Belle-Vue in September, when his enthusiasm and inspiration won recognition. \n\"I am so pleased to welcome Marc to lead the culinary   team at Belle-Vue. His creativity and passion will bring new inspiration to the restaurant, and create exciting dining experiences that are approachable and fun,\" says Martin Riehl, executive chef of the hotel. \nBriol creates and combines classic dishes with his own understanding and his signature dishes are featured in the Best of Belle-Vue selection. Most of the dishes are presented in two color1s ---- green and red. \n\"It is a nice contrast with the white plate at the moment. And it reminds me of something happy and merry.\" \nThe color1s are updated according to season, and also on request from regular customers. \nAlthough Briol has only been in Shenzhen about three months, he has fallen in love with Cantonese food. \n\"I love dim sum ---- all the steamed vegetables, chicken soup and black tea.\" \nOne interesting thing about Shenzhen is how people treat food, he says. \"If you go to the local market, you will see things such as snakes, which would belong to the zoo back in my country.\" \nHe says that in China, everything has a reason. People respect food, which is not always done in Europe. \n\"In China, if you eat something, it is because it is healthy for your body.\" \nAs for the cooking, he says, it is not easy to get raw materials for a European restaurant in Shenzhen. \n\"It took me about a month to get the fish I want for my cooking. We had to call Shanghai or Hong Kong to ship the food here,\" he says. \"When I worked in London, the process was much easier.\" \nHe gets much of his inspiration from food blogs and friends. \n\"About 80 percent of my friends come from restaurants, and they are bakers, chefs. We will meet and talk to get new ideas for food.\" Other sources of inspiration are traveling and cookbooks. \nDuring his day off, he will also try to explore new restaurants in Shenzhen. \n\"Food is all my life. You have to pay lots of effort to get it done, to improve yourself.\"", "id": "high17395.txt"}
