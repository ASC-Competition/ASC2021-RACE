Having a smiling face will help your coworkers and supervisors feel better being around you, and you may well end up harvesting the rewards by laughing more in the workplace. But you need to know how to apply humor in your work environment.\nOne of the main rules with humor in the workplace is to avoid argument when you are joking. Stay well away from joking about political affairs , race and religion. Never make fun of other people within your organization, as you are trying to win friends with the people you work with, and not set against them. If you can't help yourself, please be extremely careful.\nMaking jokes about the ups and downs of your trade is a safe way to add wit  to the place of work. You will have the benefit of knowing precisely what your coworkers have to face each and every day, and it's much better as it helps to let go of tensions and lower stress levels by getting them to chuckle  about the situations they come across frequently.\nThe very best time for some humor is when you are not working, but still in the region of the people you work with, such as a coffee or lunch break. You can also make an effort to be funny on the job, but when you are working, it's a good idea to use jokes much more discreetly than you would normally do.\nIn general, humor in the workplace can flex your creative muscles and be a great help to your job.", "id": "high19469.txt"}
