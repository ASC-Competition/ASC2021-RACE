Some work, others join the army and an increasing number worldwide are taking a \"gap year\" to travel or do community service in their own countries or abroad. They are studying sharks off the Australian coast, building schools in Mexico and learning Spanish or Italian.\nThe concept of a gap year may not be new, but the recent surge   of interest certainly is.  Some students are putting off admissions. Others, who don't get into the college of their choice, are taking a year to explore new frontiers before reapplying.\nStudents are choosing to take a breather; they are thinking. They are not sure what they are going to do. They are going and exploring some of their interests.
