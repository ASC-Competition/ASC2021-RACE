They have radio, television, and newspapers. In times of confusion (  ), however, rumor appears and becomes widespread. At such times the different kinds of news are in competition: the press, television, and radio against the\n.\nEspecially do rumors spread when war requires control on many important matters. The normal news sources no longer give out enough information. Since the people can not learn through legal channels all that they are anxious to learn, they pick up \"news\" wherever they can and when this happens, rumor grows.\nRumors are often repeated even by those who do not believe the tales.
