Seeing the children's happy faces, I'm happy, too.\" Said Carlos Domingo, an old woman of 62. \"I often played computer games in my spare time before. Now I help older people learn how to use computers.\" said another volunteer at the age of 18.\nIf everyone helps out a bit, we'll have a better world to live in. Interested?
