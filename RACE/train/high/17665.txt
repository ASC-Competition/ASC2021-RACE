At the same time the number of mew physics teachers has dropped sharply while the shortage is likely to worsen as older teachers retire.\n prefix = st1 /Britain's leading scientists and engineers expressed alarm over the findings, which they say are part of the problems in science education generally. Lord May of Oxford, president of the Royal Society, theUK's National Academy of Science, said, \"The problems facing science at A-level are well beyond physics. We have over and over again noted the general downward trend of students studying the sciences beside biology and math at A-level. If we fail to deal with this then we may lose the ability to train the next generation of scientists, technologists and engineers.\"\n      Alan Smithers and Pamela Robinson, who did the research in 432 schools and colleges inEnglandandWales, said that since 1990, the number of physics students had fallen by 38%, from 45,334 to 28,119. Nearly 10% of state schools now do not offer A-level physics, and of those that do 39.5% had five students or fewer taking it this year.\n     Over the same period, the research discovered,  the number of people who are allowed to become physics teachers dropped from about a third of the science total to 12.8%. The supply of physics teachers is not _ itself, with nearly twice as many aged over 50 as 30 or younger. Another danger is the redefinition of science subjects to \"general science\".\n     Professor Smithers and Dr Robinson warn that the subject is in danger of dying out in schools.\" Physics in schools and colleges is at risk through redefinition and lack of teachers with expertise in the subject,\" they said. \"If physics is to survive in schools, both as basic education and as a platform for higher level study and research, there is a need for immediate action.\"", "id": "high17665.txt"}
