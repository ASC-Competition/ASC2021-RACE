Gradually, I began to envy my wife Julie's teaching career, which was full of passion and challenges. However, I admitted that leaving a secure(, ) position and going to school needed courage.\nOne winter evening I heard Julie complaining about a student's bad academic performance. She said, \"Baxter used to do his homework very well, but it has dropped recently.\" The next evening when I arrived home, Julie asked, \"Will you drive me to Baxter's house? I want to talk with his family about his homework.\" After an hour, a hut  stood before us. Baxter was busy gathering firewood in the front yard. Seeing us, Baxter was surprised, but greeted us happily. Julie asked, \"Where are your parents?\" Baxter said they were not in. We found that it was dark in the hut. On our way home, Julie cried, \"His work was good in the early autumn when the days were longer. But now, in the dark, he can't do his homework.\" Then she decided to help him so that he could focus on his studies.\nI was moved by her kindness and I wanted to help poor students.
