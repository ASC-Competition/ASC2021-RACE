He lived near the edge of the polar sea. He was a bright thirteen-year-old boy with a strong, healthy body. His father was a brave man who had died during a food shortage in the village. His father tried to save the lives of his people by fighting a giant polar bear. Keesh's father was crushed to death during the struggle. But he killed the bear, and the meat from the bear kept the people from starving.\nKeesh was his only son, and he lived alone with his mother. But people are forgetful, and they soon forgot how Keesh's father had saved their lives. And since Keesh was only a boy and his mother was a woman and not a warrior , they were forced to live in the smallest and poorest igloo in the village.\nOne night there was a council meeting in the large igloo of Klosh-Kwan, who was the chief. At that meeting Keesh showed how much courage he possessed. He rose to his feet and waited for silence. Then, with the dignity of an older man, he said, \" It is true that my mother and I are given meat to eat. But the meat is always old and tough, filled with bones, and difficult to eat.\"\nThe hunters--both the young and the old--were shocked to hear a child speak to them that way. But Keesh went on steadily, \"Because my father, Bok, was a great hunter, I can speak these words. You know that Bok brought home more meat than any hunter in the village. The oldest woman, the weakest old man, received a fair share.\"\nKeesh waited calmly until the shouting died down. \"My mother has no one except me, and therefore I must speak. My father put his life in danger and died, to provide food for this village. It is only right that I, his son and his wife should have enough good meat as long as there is plenty of good meat in this village. I, Keesh, the son of Bok, have spoken.\"\nHe sat down. He could hear angry murmuring all around him. Some men began to shout at Keesh. They ordered him to leave. They threatened to punish him by not giving him any food at all. Keesh's eyes flashed and the blood pounded under his skin. In the midst of the noise and the uproar, he jumped to his feet. \n \"Listen to me, you men!\" he shouted. \"I shall never speak in this council again--not until you come to invite me to speak. My father was a great hunter, and so will I be.\"\nThey laughed at Keesh and followed him out of the igloo, shouting at him. But Keesh said nothing more. He walked away with his head raised, looking neither to the left nor the right....\n                                       ---Based on a story by Jack London", "id": "high23298.txt"}
