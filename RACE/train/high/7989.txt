She loved them very much, but two girls would fight with each other from their earliest years. As they grew older, they became total strangers. They had no contact with each other when they were adults.\nThis caused the mother great pain. Then, later, she had an idea. She decided to write a letter to them. In this letter, she told them how much she loved them, and how she wanted them to love each other in this way. She also gave them news of herself and some guidance on how to live happier lives.\nWhen the letter was ready, she wrote out one copy for each daughter, but these copies were special. Each copy contained only every second sentence of the original letter: the copy for one daughter had only the even   sentences, and the other daughter's copy contained only the odd sentences. Neither contained the fullness of the mother's message.\nWhen the two daughters received their letters, they were puzzled. To understand the half-letter, they would have to put the two letters together and read them as one, which meant they must approach one another again in love and respect. But they each blamed the other for not helping them when trying to read the half-letter.\nFor a long time, the mother waited in vain. Then one day, when the mother had almost given up hope, there was a knock at the door. There they stood, together. \"We've come home,\" they said at the same time. \"We've finally put our letters together, and we've come to say how much we love you, Mum.\" Then she hugged them both, tears of joy streaming down her cheeks, and welcomed them back home.", "id": "high7989.txt"}
