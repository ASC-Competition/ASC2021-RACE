Going to Starbucks, for example, is a status symbol. It not only says, \"I'm rich enough to buy this overpriced coffee,\" but also, \"I'm cosmopolitan   enough to be part of globalization.\"\nWhere I come from in the UK, however, chains are neither fashionable nor gourmet . Chains are where you go on New Year's Day when nowhere else is open, or when you are 5 years old and your parents can't stand hearing, \"I'm huuuuuungry!\" any longer. In my own case (with regards to McDonald's), a chain is where you are taken on your first \"date\". Even at the age of 13, I knew to give the guy the \"let's just be friends\" phone call the next day.\nIn the UK, independent cafes and restaurants are making a comeback on the fashion scene. Nowadays, a Londoner who says \"let's meet for a coffee at Monmouth\" (an independent cafe) is much cooler than one who says \"let's go to Starbucks\". Even if Monmouth's coffee is a little more expensive, there's a satisfaction in knowing your pounds aren't going straight to the big corporations.\nOf course, there are chain stores all over the UK; you can't go five minutes without spotting a Costa Coffee. But numbers do not add up to good taste.\nI do, however, have a confession  . After moving to China I had moments when all the rice and Kung Pao Chicken became too much. I, too, have retreated to McDonald's.", "id": "high19488.txt"}
