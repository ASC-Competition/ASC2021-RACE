After many tries, she still failed add was very unhappy \"Maybe I can't reach the ocean in the end,\" she said sadly to herself,\n    At this lime, a deep voice came, \"If a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river .\" It was the voice of the desert. But the little stream replied, \"That's because a breeze can fly, but I cannot.\"\n    \"That's because you can't give up what you are. If you like to do it, and left yourself evaporate into the breeze, it can take you across, and you can reach the ocean .\"said the desert,                                                               \n    \"Give up what I am now and disappear into the breeze?
