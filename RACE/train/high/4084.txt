Scientists say the results suggest that the heart is able to influence how the brain responds to a fearful event, depending on which point it is at in its regular cycle of contraction and relaxation.\nSarah Garfinkel at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School said: \"Our study shows for the first time that the way in which we deal with fear is different depending on when we see fearful pictures in relation to our heart.\"\nThe study tested 20 healthy volunteers on their reactions to fear as they were shown pictures of fearful faces. Dr Garfinkel said, \"The study showed that fearful faces are better noticed when the heart is pumping than when it is relaxed. Thus our hearts can also affect what we see and what we don't see - and guide whether we see fear.\"\nTo further understand this relationship, the scientists also used a brain scanner  to show how the brain influences the way the heart changes a person's feeling of fear. \"We have found an important _ by which the heart and brain 'speak'to each other to change our feelings and reduce fear,\" Dr Garfinkel said.\n\"We hope that by increasing our understanding about how fear is dealt with and ways that it could be reduced, we may be able to develop more successful treatments for anxiety disorders, and also for those for those who may be suffering from serious stress disorder.\"", "id": "high4084.txt"}
