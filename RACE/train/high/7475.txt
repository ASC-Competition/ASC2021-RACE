The government is co-operating with a US-based environmental protection agency to update existing buses and trucks with clean fuel technology. The new technology could reduce air pollutants in existing diesel vehicles   by 40 per cent. The programme will begin by testing buses in Beijing to see if the technology can be applied to them.\n\"We encourage the development of public transportation. But at the same time we need to reduce pollution from them,\" said an official.\nEfforts are being made to improve the capital's environment with tighter controls on emissions  . Some heavily polluting factories and construction sites, such as those owned by the steel giant Shougang Group, have been asked to cut production in November and December or be closed.\nBeijing was the third polluted city in the world at the end of last century, according to the UN.
