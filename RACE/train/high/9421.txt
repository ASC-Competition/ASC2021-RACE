About one-third of companies froze raises altogether.\nFor 2010, World at Work's survey projects an average salary increase budget of 2.7 percent, a figure that shows the situation has improved but the job market is still weak. Between 10 percent and 15 percent of companies said they would freeze raises--far fewer than in 2009, but still more than in most years.\nHow can you get a raise? Avalos and others offer the following tips:\n* Do your job well. This means producing high-quality work, of course, but also keeping the big picture in mind.\n\"It really comes down to positioning yourself as a high performer, somebody who is aware of business goals and helps the company meet their goals as an organization\", Avalos said\n* Be visible. When times are tough, some workers think. \"I'm going to hunker down and hope that nobody notices me, because I don't want to be on a layoff list,\" said Richard Phillips, owner of Advantage Career Solutions. This is a mistake, because you're unlikely to get a raise if no one knows what you have accomplished. \"If anything, what you want to do is be more visible.\"\n* Make your boss's life easier. This means everything from having a good attitude to taking on extra tasks. If you don't know how you can help your boss, ask.\n* Ask for a raise. Talk to your boss and present your case: Here's what I've done, here's how it fits with the company's goals, and here is why I think it's worth a salary increase. In some cases, even if your company has an official raise freeze, you can get a raise if you make good case.\nIf the answer is no -- or if you're not ready to ask directly -- Phillips suggests asking, \"What would you like to see from me that would put me in line for a raise?\"\nA question like this can improve your standing. \"Just asking the question says to the boss, 'I'm thinking about where I fit in here, what I can do,\" Phillips said, \"That in and of itself has value.\"", "id": "high9421.txt"}
