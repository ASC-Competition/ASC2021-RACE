During the hours when you labor (work) through your work, you may say that you are \"hot\". That is true, the time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak  . For some people the peak comes during the forenoon  . For others it comes in the afternoon or evening. No one has discovered why this is so.\nMuch family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what this energy cycle means and which cycle each member of the family has.\nYou cannot change your cycle, but you can learn to make your life fit it better. \"Habits can help,\" Dr. Cleiman believes. If your energy cycle is low in the morning but you have an important job early in the day, rise before your usual hour, and then you will work better at your low point.\nGet off to a slow start which saves your energy. Get up with a lazy yawn  and stretch . Sit on the edge of bed before putting your feet on the floor. Avoid the troublesome searching for clean clothes by laying them out the night before.", "id": "high15663.txt"}
