She is preparing to enjoy bluegrass music the old-fashioned way: with friends, at home, for free.\n\" To be able to play with other people face to face and have that sort of connection, it is spiritual,\" Ms Noelke-Olson said of the weekly house concerts in Chicago she participates in. \" It's like a good conversation with instruments---something that doesn't seem to happen much any more because everyone is chatting on their cellphones.\"\nShe is among a growing group of Americans who are finding it pleasant to get away from the digital grid , at least temporarily. While there is no exact data to track how many people are forming knitting groups, hosting house concerts, or organizing family game nights, it is possible to connect the dots between the rising price of entertainment and the rising sales of board games and craft supplies.\nIn the past two years, the prices for restaurant meals, concert tickets, and movie tickets all increased. At the same time, board games sales rose 6 percent, while total toy sales decreased 3 percent.\nThese trends are expected to continue because of the struggling economy. Instead of equipping their homes with expensive home entertainment systems, consumers are more likely to pick up the old-fashioned way: eye-to-eye. Families are rediscovering ways to come together that have nothing to do with high technology.\n\"People are turning inward to build an enjoyment time for family and home,\" said Linda Bettencourt, an interior designer in San Francisco whose customers typically live in million-dollar homes. Over the past six months, Ms Bettencourt has been hired to redesign living space to promote the kind of connectivity that doesn't involve wires. \" The big game table is back,\" she says. \"People want to sit around and see each other's face rather than facing a flat-screen TV.\"", "id": "high23637.txt"}
