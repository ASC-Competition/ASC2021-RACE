A patient with major depression has a smaller hippocampus. The brain changes in the hamsters might arise from fluctuations   in the production of the hormone melatonin  . Melatonin signals to the body that it's nighttime,but a light at night dampens its production. The hormone has been shown to affect mood,and so a decrease in melatonin might prompt depression,Bedrosian says.\nIf the same mechanism is at work in people,then \"people might want to try to avoid falling asleep with their TVs on at night,or to try to minimize light exposure during the night,\" she adds.", "id": "high21767.txt"}
