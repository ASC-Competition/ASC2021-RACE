And on E days I'd go to another elective class,such as First aid or Art.\nSo I explained our new system to the children.\"Jolee,you were born first,\"I said. \"Is one an odd number or all even one?\"\n\"It's odd,Mom.\"    \n\"And A1,you arrived second.Is two odd or even?\"\n\"It's even,Mom.\"\n\"Ok,so Jolee,from now on,every odd day is automatically your own special day.That means you get to pick what to watch,or which board game to play.Al,the same applies to you on even days.\"    \nHe thought about it a minute,then said,\"But there are more odd days than even ones in some months.Jolee will get'her day'two times in a row when a month ends in 31,and the next one begins with a one.\"\n\"True,\" I said,\"but that also means she'11 be taking the smelly,disgusting rubbish out,washing the dishes,and doing other less-enjoyable things two more days in a row,and you won't.It's part of life's give-and-take.\"\nFor the first few days after that,whenever one kid shouted,\"Mom!\"I'd just call out,\"Whose day is it?\"That settled it.Soon.the quarrelling ended.\nAh,the complete joy of peace and quiet !", "id": "high18273.txt"}
