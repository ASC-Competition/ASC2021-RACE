Suddenly, it started raining heavily. I hurried to pay for my locker, but I was disappointed when they informed me they only accepted cash. I was $ 7.00 short, which meant I had to carry the books back home. It would be an exhausting   two-hour journey back home with all those books.\nAn elderly gentleman nearby noticed my problem. He asked how much cash I needed. When I told him I was $7 short, he quickly took out the money from his wallet .\"You don't have to pay me back ,\"he said. I was speechless; I didn't know whether to take the money or come back with the books the next day. A young student who was working there noticed my hesitation. \"He's really nice ,\"said the student. I was starving this morning and he bought breakfast for me. He always helps people in different ways.\nThe next day, I went to him and thanked him for trusting me and lending me the money. He said he forgot about it and didn't expect I would give it back. \"I'm very happy,\" he said,\"not because I'm getting my money back, but because this is the right way to go---whatever you get from this world, give it back as much as you possibly can. Spread kindness around the world with the smallest things you can do.\"\nLater, I found out he wasn't involved with any charity organizations. He has been performing these types of acts for years. Earlier, someone had done something incredibly kind for him and he has been spreading the kindness ever since.\nHe taught me a very important lesson in life. We come to this world with nothing and we will leave with nothing. Whatever we own, it will become somebody else's and whatever we leave, it will become somebody else's.", "id": "high2953.txt"}
