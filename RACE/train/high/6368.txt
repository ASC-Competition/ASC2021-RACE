Many of us use a lift several times during the day without really thinking about it. But Lee Gray, PhD of the University of North Carolina, US, has made it his business to examine this overlooked form of public transport. He is known as the \"Elevator Guy\".\n\"The lift becomes this interesting social space where etiquette   is sort of odd  ,\" Gray told the BBC. \"Elevators are socially very interesting but often very awkward   places.\"\nWe walk in and usually turn around to face the door. If someone else comes in, we may have to move. And here, according to Gray, lift users unthinkingly go through a set pattern of movements. He told the BBC what he had observed.\nHe explained that when you are the only one inside a lift, you can do whatever you want - it's your own little box.\nIf there are two of you, you go into different corners, standing diagonally   across from each other to create distance.\nWhen a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle . And when there is a fourth person it becomes a square, with someone in every corner. A fifth person is probably going to have to stand in the middle.\nNew entrants to the lift will need to _ the situation when the doors slide open and then act according to their decisions. Once in, for most people the rule is simple - look down, or look at your phone.\nWhy are we so awkward in lifts?\n\"You don't have enough space,\" Professor Babette Renneberg, a clinical psychologist at the Free University of Berlin, told the BBC. \"Usually when we meet other people, we have about an arm's length of distance between us. And that's not possible in most elevators.\"\nIn such a small, enclosed space it becomes very important to act in a way that cannot be understood as threatening or odd. \"The easiest way to do this is to avoid eye contact  ,\" she said.", "id": "high6368.txt"}
