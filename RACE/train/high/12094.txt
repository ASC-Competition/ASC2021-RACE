Still, many child-development experts agree that tying a child's allowance to chores can be a slippery slope. Here's why.\nSusie Walton, master instructor at Peace in Your Home advises to keep chores and allowances totally separate. \"Allowance is one thing. When it comes to chores, life skills, responsibilities-that's a whole different thing.\" says Walton.\nWalton says, \"When kids aren't doing a chore, you don't say, 'well, there goes your allowance.' You're going to sit them down and ask what's going on. 'We are a team. We are a family. We've got to have them done.'\"\nBesides, by paying children for chores with an allowance, you'll also be sending the message that work isn't worth doing unless they're getting paid for it.\nThere are times when it would make sense to pay kids for chores. Most financial and child-development experts agree that it's a fine idea to pay children money for extra jobs that are outside their normal set of chores, such as washing windows, washing the car or helping to clean out the garage-especially if the child is saving for a big item. This may even develop an entrepreneurial   spirit to think outside of the box to earn money.\nFor parents who are concerned that their children won't learn the value of a dollar if the allowance isn't tied to household chores, note that there are still plenty of money management skills to be learned from a straight allowance. Depending on the age, kids can be made responsible for paying for their own toys or snacks. Some parents even require that kids set aside a percentage of their allowance toward savings.\n\"I really like having my own money,\" says Kevin, 9. \"It's up to me if I want to buy the cheap toy now, or save and get the better toy.\" And that's a good lesson to learn at 9 years old.\nNo matter which allowance route you take in parenthood, kids will feel empowered by being able to handle their own money.", "id": "high12094.txt"}
