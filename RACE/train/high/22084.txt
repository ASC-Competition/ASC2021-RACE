We closed the door behind us and we were alone. Margot had come faster on her bicycle and was already waiting for us. All the rooms were full boxes. They lay on the floor and the beds. The little room was filled with bedclothes. We had to start clearing up at once, if we wished to sleep in comfortable beds that night. Mummy and Margot were not able to help. They were tired and lay down on their beds. But Daddy and I, the two \"helpers' of the family, started at once. \nThe whole day we unpacked the boxes, filled the cupboards and tidied, until we were extremely tired. We did sleep in clean beds that night. We hadn't had any warm food to eat all day, but we didn't care. Mummy and Margot were too tired and worried to eat, and Daddy and I were too busy.", "id": "high22084.txt"}
