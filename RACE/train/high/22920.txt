They have discovered that the arrangement  of taste buds  on the tongue varies for different body types. The scientist team examined 1,000 British adults and divided them into three physiologically  recognized body types--ectomorphs, endomorphs mesomorphs. They determined that a person's body type indicated  where they were likely to have the most taste buds - on the sweet, bitter or salty areas of their tongues.\n The study showed that ectomorphs, who make up one in three of the population, usually have a small delicate shape, have a sweet tooth but hate bitter foods. Mesomorphs, who make up 20percent of the population, usually have a muscular shape and prefer salty and bitter foods but dislike sweet foods. Half the British population are endomorphs with soft, rounded bodies, and they like most foods. The findings showed that for two in three people food preference was a physiological rather than a psychological choice.\n  Body shape expert Simon Bradshaw, who takes change of his team, said, \"It appears that simply by looking at a person's body shape we can make sure about their taste preferences.\" But Catherine Collins, of the British Dietetic Association said, \"It is difficult to tell whether our body shape dictates the food we like, or the food we like dictates body shape. _ people who prefer most types of foods will be fatter and people who are the endomorph shape tend to  find it more difficult to lose weight.\"", "id": "high22920.txt"}
