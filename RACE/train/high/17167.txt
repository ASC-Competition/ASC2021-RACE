Mutter is also one of the world's youngest professors.\nBorn in Rheinfelden on June 29, 1963, Anne-Sophie grew up in Wehr, a small town just five kilometers from the Swiss border. Her father, Karl Wilhelm Mutter, and her mother, Gerlinde, considered music lessons part of a good education. Thus, their son, Andreas, began practicing the violin at eight, and his younger brother, Christoph, had piano lessons. It came as no surprise when Anne-Sophie said she wanted a violin for her fifth birthday.\nHer parents thought she was too young for the violin, and persuaded her to start on the piano. But Anne-Sophie has always had a mind of her own. \"I longed to play the violin,\" she says. \"It seemed to me a much more interesting instrument.\" After six months, her parents gave in.\nThe famous violin teacher Erna Honigberger, who lived nearby, became Anne-Sophie's tutor. After only nine months of lessons, she entered the six-year-old in a nationwide competition for young musicians. With Christoph accompanying her on the piano, Anne-Sophie won first prize.\nIn 1974, Erna, Erna Honigberger died. Anne - Sophie's new teacher was Aida Stucki. She taught Anne-Sophie to develop her own ideas on how a piece should be played, not just to imitate others. This is one of the violinist's strongest most distinctive characteristics today.\nThough the Mutters were short of money at time, they limited their daughter's performances to one or two a year. \"We are glad we went the family road,\" says her father. \"No outsider can ever have an effect on our daughter's career or push her into playing more concerts than she wants to.\" Later she was allowed to give six to eight concerts a year and make some recordings. Only when she turned 18 did she begin her professional career.", "id": "high17167.txt"}
