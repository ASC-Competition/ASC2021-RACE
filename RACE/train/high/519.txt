And anyone who watches them regularly knows that each one is different in style . But no two shows are more opposite in content, while at the same time standing out above the rest, than the Jerry Springer and the Oprah Winfrey shows.\nJerry Springer could easily be considered the king of \"rubbish talk\". The contents on his show are as surprising as can be. For example, the show takes the ever-common talk show titles of love, sex, cheating, and hate, to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is about the dark side of society, yet people are willing to eat up the troubles of other people's lives.\nLike Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes TV talk show to its top. But Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show is mainly about the improvement of society and different quality  of life. Contents are from teaching your children lessons, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.\nCompared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being poured into society. Jerry ends every show with a \"final word\". He makes a small speech about the entire idea of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.\nClean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main viewers are middleclass Americans. Most of these people have the time, money, and ability to deal with life's tough problems. Jerry Springer, on the other hand, has more of a connection with the young adults of society. These are 18-to-21-year-olds whose main troubles in life include love, relationship, sex, money and drug. They are the ones who see some value and lessons to be learned through the show's exploitation.", "id": "high519.txt"}
