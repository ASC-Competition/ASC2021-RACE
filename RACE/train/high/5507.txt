After taking them apart and rebuilding them, Dell realized the components   could be bought for one-fourth the price. Soon he was buying components to reduce the cost. A good business decision, but it meant his room was starting to look like a mechanic's shop.\n\"I was quite excited about the possibilities for personal computers and how they could change society. I had this idea to sell the products directly to the users over the phone\", he said. College plans and his parents' expectations bothered him a lot. But Michael Dell was determined. He drove off to the University of Texas at Austin in August 1983 in a car he'd bought with earnings from selling newspapers.
