This may be one of the hardest decisions voters have to make between two appealing candidates. \nThe big question for voters, as they face both an economic downturn and international threats, is: who will they elect? A young first-term senator promising change and new ideas, or a longtime senator with strong military experience and a reputation as a maverick  ?\n    American voters have never seen a candidate quite like Obama. He has a white mother from theprefix = st1 /USand a black father fromKenyawho left the family when Obama was very young. He spent part of his youth inIndonesia.\n    His supporters say Obama's childhood gives him the advantage to repair the recent damage done toAmerica's image abroad.

And perhaps most important of all, will swing   voters be more drawn to Obama's vision   or to McCain's experience? \nWhatever happens, one thing is clear: Whoever walks into the White House on January 20, 2009, will find enormous challenges waiting for him in the Oval Office, both at home and abroad.", "id": "high22546.txt"}
