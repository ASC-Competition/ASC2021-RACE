The trip was for 2 weeks during the March break from school. This trip was probably about 20 years ago so it was before the time of things like portable video games and being able to watch movies in the back seat.2\nSo to pass the many hours of travel my brother and I had to entertain ourselves and each other. My mum would set the back seat up so that it was our own little playroom. She would pack everything up so that we had a big level area to play in. We would play cards and board games.C\nWhen it got to the point where we were at each other's throats we would be sent back to our own side of the seat and would be forced to either nap or read by ourselves until we could be friendly to each other again. I can remember us playing for quite some time when we turned the back seat into a spaceship and traveled around the earth.f\nAnother time we turned it into a kitchen and had a bake-off . But the thing that I remember the most and that gave us many hours of enjoyment was using each other's faces as silly Plasticine  and making funny faces. We would see how far we could stretch each other's mouths open, see how thin we could make the other's eye by pulling on it. We would keep going until one of us begged for mercy because we had to give our faces a rest.7\nSo while I can remember us having a great time on the beach, laughing a lot trying to put the tent up in the rain, what I remember the most of that trip and what always makes me smile the most is remembering the pain that our faces would be in after the trip.g", "id": "high19955.txt"}
