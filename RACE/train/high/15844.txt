Keep these tips in mind:\nDecide how you are going to use your new mountain bike.\nAre you a new rider who simply wants to travel outdoors on the weekend,weather permitting?Do you intend to test yourself on the rough roads,every day,rain or shine?Or are you going to use your new mountain bike to ride to and from school or work?Be honest about your intentions,and you're more than half way toward choosing the right mountain bike for you.\nVisit your local bike shops.\nAny good bike shop will stock a wide range of quality mountain bikes in all price points and sizes. Your local bike shops will carry more than one brand of bicycle. Not only will they sell you a mountain bike that suits your needs,but they will service what they sell. Visit at least a few shops. You'll get one that satisfies you right away.\nDon't be bashful.\nTell your salesperson how you intend to use your new mountain bike,and how much you are willing to spend. Your salesperson will show you a selection of models and brands accordingly. He or she will also help you determine the right size for you. You may ask more without any sense of shyness.\nTake a test ride.\nAll good bike shops let customers take test rides. There's a good reason for this beyond \"trybeforeyoubuy\" salesmanship. Since you already know your price range and find the right size,you now have to find out which brand you ride best. They want you to be happy with your purchase. After only a few test rides from more than one bike shop,the right mountain bike will choose you.", "id": "high15844.txt"}
