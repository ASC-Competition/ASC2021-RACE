By stepping into the Human Race Machine, you can find out. When you sit inside it, the machine creates a digital image of your face. After pushing certain buttons, the machine uses various photos of people of a certain ethnic group mixed with your own facial features. From this, it can  _ an image showing how you would look as a member of a different race.\n    The machine is part of a traveling retrospective   called \" Seeing and Believing: The Art of Nancy Burson.\" Burson is a famous American photographer and inventor. The show of 100 photos and multimedia works was on view at the Grey Art Gallery in New York on April 20.\n    \" It is a strange feeling, just like stepping into someone else's skin.\" said Hathy Zajchenko, a museum visitor from Pennsylvania, US. As soon as she sat down, she tried out a range of ethnic groups. \" The Middle Eastern image worked pretty well for me,\" she said with a smile.\n    According to Burson,  _ It is about seeing through differences to find the things we all share in common. Burson added the database of Middle Eastern faces, both Arab and Jewish, after the terrorist attacks on September 11. \"I have always wanted to allow people to see differently. I am a photographer. I am recording the unseen, because what we can not see is so much more interesting than what we can see,\" Burson said.\nFor those who missed the show, the Human Race machine will be on view at the New York Hall of Science in the Queens district full-time as of June.", "id": "high20085.txt"}
