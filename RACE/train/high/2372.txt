The social connections may help in the future.\"\nThe latest report from the US-based institute of International Education said China, for the first time, has become the top country of origin for international students in the United States.\nFor Yang Fan, a journalism student, said studying in the United States is a way to escape the competition for places in China's top universities.\n\"Due to limited education resources, only about 60 percent of high school graduates in China enter college, and a much lower rate enters the top-level ones. \"A foreign degree will definitely help when I seek a job in China,\" Yang said.\nBoth Yang's and Luo's parents are supportive of them studying abroad.
