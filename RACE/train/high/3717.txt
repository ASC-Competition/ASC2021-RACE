But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias  much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological  . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\"scaredy cat\". Handling the fears is essential.\nChildren can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog. But you can approach it yourself, show them there is nothing to be afraid of, stroke( ) it, and talk about the dog being friendly. Once your child dares to stroke a dog-one that's good with children, of course---then you should encourage them to carry on until they feel calmer, and reward them for'being brave'.\"", "id": "high3717.txt"}
