Please let Benjerman come home,\" the notice said.\nIt is not known whether the thief showed any pity, but almost 30 hours after the 1 pm theft Friday, Kimberly Atkins of Dover and Benjerman, a 12-year-old black retriever  , were reunited after police located them in Barrington.\n\"He's hungry, he's dirty, but he's very happy to be home,\" Atkins said.\nThe car was found at about 5 pm Saturday off Route 125 in a swampy   area frequented by off-the-road cars and dirt bikes. However, the police couldn't control Benjerman, and they had to call Atkins to come and get him.\nAtkins said the thief cared for Benjerman a little by providing him with some dry cat food. She believed Benjerman ended up drinking some muddy water in the area. She said they have been together for nearly 11 years after she took him back from a society shelter in Dallas, Texas.\nBefore Benjelman was found, Atkins and several friends put up notices all over the city and in Somersworth. They also contacted animal shelters,throughout southern New Hampshire and Massachusetts.\nThe notice stated there was a reward, and also that the dog needed medication. Any caller could remain anonymous  .\nAtkins had parked the car outside a hardware store with the keys inside and gone in to rent a carpet cleaner. \"It was l0 minutes and I came out and my car was gone along with Benjerman in broad daylight,\" Atkins said. The car thief threw Atkins' wallet and other personal items out of the car before escaping from the scene.", "id": "high283.txt"}
