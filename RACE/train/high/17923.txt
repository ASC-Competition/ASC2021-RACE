The number of Internet hours in the West is increasing each month, but online addiction is still not attracting a great deal of attention.\nPerhaps one reason Internet addiction has not  _ in the West is that there are too many other vices   available. In a society  ly open to sex, gambling, alcohol and drugs, computer games are not always appealing to young people. In fact, there is almost a shame attached to playing online games. Many consider it an \"uncool\" thing to do. They would rather spend their free time meeting friends.\nBut this is not to say that people don't do it. One website, wowdetox.com, still offers support to recovering \"addicts\". One user posted on the website: \"I would play all night and spend all day sleeping. I just quit a month ago. Best decision ever.\" This is just one example from around 1,660 pages of confessions  . Still, computer game addiction is not officially recognized in the West. Just last years, the American Medical Association refused calls to have computer game addiction classified   as a disease, saying that, \"Nothing suggests it is a complex disease similar to alcoholism.\"\nOnline gaming is more personal in the West. It is rare for people to visit Internet cafes or play with friends at home. After all, the majority of households have their own fast Internet connection. This removes the social joy with friends. And this choice of playing alone is not very appealing to many people.", "id": "high17923.txt"}
