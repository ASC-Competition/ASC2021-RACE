I am taking a nurse course called \"Urban Community \". We were asked to do a major project on problems in urban communities. I chose the topic \"Homeless\".\nEach day I would walk down the streets of the homeless and offer them something to drink and to eat. I know it's tough to survive on the streets. Last night I ran into a group of 30 kids who were living on the streets in New York. _ and I just wanted to cry. But I had to be strong.\nI asked about their families and if they contacted them to let them know they were alive. Most of them said, \"NO!\" They all looked like a happy family and they took care of one another. I tried to persuade them to get help and to contact their families but they did not want to. I did not want to make them to do it as they had their own reasons.\nAll these kids were very respectful. None of them was high on drugs nor were they drinking. Some of them enjoyed reading and writing. Some of them enjoyed skateboarding, dancing and playing music.\nOne girl asked me if I could give her a hug and I did so. She started to cry and said, \"Thank you for not treating us as freaks like everyone else does. People don't realize that we all have our own problems and some are worse than others.\" She told me that her stepfather   was extremely mean to her and her mother did not believe her. She ran away. Her street name was Little Mary.\nThey were good kids just trying to make ends meet. I told them that I didn't have much to offer because I was a single mother just making ends meet. I had offered them sandwiches and drinks. They were so happy to have something to eat and told me that I couldn't change the world but at least there was someone who really cared.", "id": "high9560.txt"}
