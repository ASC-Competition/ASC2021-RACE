The public relations reason was that health-conscious consumers associated the word \"fried\" with \"unhealthy\", causing some of them to completely avoid the wide variety of \"healthy\" menu items. The new title and image were designed to attract customers to a restaurant now offering foods branded as \"better for you\".\nIt sounded good, but the real reason behind the shift to KFC had nothing to do with critical consumers. In 1990, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, trapped in debt, took the unusual step of trade marking its name. Therefore, anyone using the word \"Kentucky\" for business reasons would have to obtain permission and pay licensing fees to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. It was an unusual and brilliant scheme to lighten government debt, but it was also one that alienated  one of the most famous companies ever associated with Kentucky. The Kentucky Fried Chicken chain refused as a matter of principle to pay royalties on a name they had been using for four decades. After a year of fruitless talks, Kentucky Fried Chicken changed their name instead, introducing new packaging and products to hide the real reasons behind the change of the name.\nKentucky fried Chicken was not the only one who bravely refused to give in. The name of the most famous horse race in North America, held every year at Churchill Downs, was changed to \"The Run for the Roses\" for similar reasons.\nIn November 2006, KFC and the State of Kentucky finally reached a settlement over the use of the trademarked word \"Kentucky\", and the restaurant chain announced it would be reusing its former name of \"Kentucky Fried Chicken\".", "id": "high3634.txt"}
