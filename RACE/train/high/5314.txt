You have a second to make a dangerous decision. One peck  ? Two pecks? Three? No kisses at all? Why, I think, as I crash into the other person's face, why can't it be as simple as a handshake?\nA survey by the soap company Radox in May showed one in five Brits now feels a handshake is \"too formal\", according to the Daily Mail. Some 42 percent said they never shook hands when greeting friends. For one third of people the alternative was a hug, for 16 percent a kiss on the cheek.\nBritish people are known to be reserved   - unfriendly, some would say. Handshakes used to work for us because we didn't have to get too close. But the super-British handshake is no longer fashionable. We want to be more like our easygoing Mediterranean neighbors who greet each other with kisses and hugs.\nThe trouble is, we still find it a bit awkward. What does a married man do when greeting a married female friend, for example? How should someone younger greet someone older?\nGuys don't tend to kiss one another; my male friends in Britain go for the \"manly hug\", taking each other stiffly   in one arm and giving a few thumps on the back with words like \"Take it easy, yeah?\".\nThe biggest questions, if you do decide to kiss, are how many times and which cheek first. Unlike the French, who comfortably deliver three, our cheek-pecks usually end in embarrassed giggling  : \"Oh, gosh, sorry, I didn't mean to kiss you on the lips, I never know where to aim for first!\"\nBut then it's never been easy for us poor, uncomfortable Brits. Even the handshake had its problems: don't shake too hard, but don't hold the other person's hand too limply   either, and definitely don't go in with sweaty hands.\nMaybe it's better to leave it at a smile and a nod.", "id": "high5314.txt"}
