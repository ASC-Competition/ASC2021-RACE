I'm not a football commentator , though-just an English teacher in Japan.\nI come to Japan two years ago, and didn't think I would stay, but Japan has that effect on you. _ . I think it's best to teach in a bigger city where there are other foreigners to mix with, rather than a small town where English teachers often complain of feeling like a goldfish in a bowl. Many people choose to live in Tokyo, of course, which is good for the nightlife factor. But I'd say that for general quality of living, cities of neither too large nor too small, like Sapporo where I live, are better choices.\nI teach English privately, which means I'm my own boss. If you want to devote yourself to private teaching, it's well worth doing a TEFL course first, because your lessons will be much better for it. The problem with private teaching is finding students; it took me a year to build up a full schedule  of private lessons, so I started out teaching in schools part-time.\nMost of my foreign friends here work full-time for big English conversation schools. The salary is fine to live on, but whether you can save money depends on how much going out and traveling you do here.\nThe schools are unwilling to take time off -even teachers with tickets for the England-Argentina game had trouble getting the day off.", "id": "high3919.txt"}
