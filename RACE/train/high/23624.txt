After checking the couple out, the doctor told them that they were physically okay but might want to start writing things down and make notes to help them remember things. The couple thanked the doctor and left.\nLater that night, while watching TV, the man got up from his chair and his wife asked, \"Where are you going?\"\nHe replied, \"To the kitchen.\"\nShe asked, \"Will you get me a cup of ice cream?\"\nHe replied, \"Sure.\"\nShe then asked him, \"Don't you think you should write it down so you can remember it?\"\nHe said, \"No, I can remember that.\"\nShe then said, \"Well, I would also like some strawberries on top. You had better write that down because I know you'll forget that.\"\nHe said, \"I can remember that. You want a cup of ice cream with strawberries.\"\nShe replied, \"Well, I also would like some whipped cream on top. I know you will forget that so you'd better write it down.\"\nWith anger in his voice, he said, \"I don't need to write that down! I can remember that.\" He then went into the kitchen.\nAfter about 20 minutes he returned from the kitchen and handed her a plate of bacon and eggs. She stared at the plate for a moment and said angrily, \"I told you to write it down! You forgot my bread!\"", "id": "high23624.txt"}
