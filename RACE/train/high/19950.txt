The ancient Greeks turned it into a science, \"physiognomy\". As early as 500 BC, the mathematician Pythagoras would look carefully at young men's faces to determine if they'd make a good student, not long after Aristotle wrote how large-headed people were mean. It was widely believed at the time that the animal a person resembled was a good judge of character.\nBy the Middle Ages it was well and truly mainstream. Professionals coined the phrase \"stuck-up\" to refer from the belief that those with upturned noses had an air of superiority, \"high-brow\" to refer to the high foreheads of nobles and \"low-brow\" to the less educated foreheads of the lower classes.\nBack in 2016, we're still doing it. We view those who resemble Labradors   as warm, while those who resemble lions as more of a ruler. We think of those with \"resting moody face\" as more aggressive, those who are less attractive as sick and expect people who look familiar to share our values. Many of these judgments occur in as little as 50 milliseconds.\nTo get to understand and find out why having a babyface is so great, first we need to know what happens when we recognize an actual baby.\nIn fact, the features of babies and those universally considered \"cute\" are nothing more than a series of developmental accidents. Our eyes are already fully grown by the time we're born but our heads aren't. Similarly, our bodies do a lot more growing later on than our heads. Babies have more body fat than adults, chubby  cheeks, for example. The list goes on.\nAnd regardless of whether you're very maternal   or find babies really annoying, we're unconditionally to respond to their features by turning into gentle baby-talking fools. Most importantly, gazing into their innocent faces makes us less aggressive and more generous and helpful.\nSo there you have it. Next time you find yourself staring affectionately into the eyes of a baby-faced friend, colleague or date, just remember, you may be the latest victim in a long-running systematic evolutionary trick.", "id": "high19950.txt"}
