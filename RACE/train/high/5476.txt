If it couldn't be free, then they wanted it \"new\" or at least at a low price. It seems that 70 percent of people aged 16 to 24 download music online but only 1 in 40 tracks are bought legally.\nThus, some companies are planning to give all of their music away for free. The music will be totally free except that you will have to pay with your time by watching advertisements. This will be perfect for those who have lots of time but little money.\nThe Web has encouraged a belief that things can be free, or at least very cheap. It seems that everyone is looking for a good deal on the Web. The desire for free objects is part of the nature of the Web because the Web is about self-service and self-service is all about being free, cheap, fast and convenient. It's interesting how words change their meaning. Stealing has now become file sharing, but it's not really stealing, is it?\nFree is a funny word. We all know that very little is really for free. If we go searching on the Web for free music, we know--or should know--that there are risks involved. However, it doesn't matter. We still want free things, or at least the sense that we're getting a real bargain and that at a minimum we're saving time.\nWhat can be the worst experience on the Web? A site that charges us high prices and wastes our time.", "id": "high5476.txt"}
