Instead, , I found myself standing in a queue that went all the way into the hallway.I had never seen so many people there on a weekday. The queue moved very slowly.My patience ran out and I got angry. When I got to the counter finally, I finished my business quickly and briefly, and then walked past the queue that was now extending past the front door.\nThinking I was going to be late for my dentist  appointment, I was scowling   as I headed into the parking lot.\nA woman was coming across the lot in my direction.She was walking with determination, and each step sounded very heavy.I noticed that she had a scowling on her face. Her body language said that she was having a really terrible day.My anger disappeared.I wished I could wrap her in a hug but I was a stranger. So I did what I could in a minute before she hurried past me-I smiled.In a second everything changed.She was surprised. Then her face softened and her shoulders relaxed.I saw her take a deep breath.Her pace slowed and she smiled back at me as we passed each other.\nI continued to smile all the way to my car. Wow, it's amazing what a simple smile can do.From then on, I became aware of people's expressions and my own, the way we show our feelings.Now I use that awareness in my everyday life to let it remind me that when facing the world, I can try a smile.", "id": "high18452.txt"}
