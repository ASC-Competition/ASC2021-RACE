You would feel upset if, when you got there, you were the only person in ordinary clothes.\nDinner is generally served at about half past seven. All the members of the family sit down together and are on their best behavior. The guest of honor will sit on the right of the lady of the house. There are two schools of thought as to the seating of the hostess. One is that she sits at the foot of the table but this may mess up the man-woman-man setting order. The other way is for the guest of honor to sit at the foot and the hostess to sit on his right. The wife of the guest of honor will sit on the right of the host.
