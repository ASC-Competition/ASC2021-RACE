Unfortunately, It is also a place where a lot of natural resources start to fall behind. Take a look around next time you're at work. See how many lights are left on when people leave. See how much paper is being wasted. How much electricity is being used to run computers that are left on. Look at how much water is being wasted in the rest-rooms. And how much solid waste is being thrown out in the rubbish cans. We bet it's a lot.\nNow, here are some simple ways you can produce less waste at work. When you are at the copier, only make the copies you need. Use both sides of the paper when writing something less important. Turn off your lights when you leave. Use a lower watt bulb in your lamp. Drink your coffee or tea out of your _ instead of single-use cups. Set up a recycling box for cans and one for bottles. And when you're in the bathroom brushing your teeth or washing your face, don't let the tap run. Remember, if we use fewer resources today, we'll save more for tomorrow.", "id": "high3708.txt"}
