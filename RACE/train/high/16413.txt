Who decides what you buy in the supermarket? Do you decide? Does the supermarket decide?\nWhen you enter the supermarket, you see shelves full of food. You walk in the aisles   between the shelves. You push a shopping cart and put your food in it.\nYou probably hear soft, slow music as you walk along the aisles. This may be an attempt to please you, so you will enjoy shopping. Some supermarkets want to increase their profits by playing soft and slow music, because the slow music makes you walk slowly and you have more time to buy things.\nFresh fruit and vegetables are usually put near the entrance. When you arrive at the supermarket, you think about the kinds of fruit and vegetables you need first. Once you've got that out of the way, you can relax and do the rest of the shopping without any hurry. Besides, if you see fresh goods first, it gives you a \"feel good\" impression of freshness, so you can not help spending your money.\nMaybe you go to the meat department then. There is some meat on sale, and you want to find it. The manager of the supermarket knows where customers enter the meat department. The cheaper meat is at the other end of the meat department, away from where the customers enter. You have to walk past all the expensive meat before you find the cheaper meat. Maybe you will buy some of the expensive meat instead of the meat on sale.\nMost of the food in supermarkets is very attractive. It all says \"Buy me quickly!\" to the customers. The fresh fruit and vegetables say \"Buy me quickly!\" as you walk by. The expensive meat says \"Buy me quickly!\" The supermarket tells you what to buy.", "id": "high16413.txt"}
