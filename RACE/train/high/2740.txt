Usually I would have gotten annoyed because I know I don't steal, so why does my bag need to be tagged? I'd just witnessed someone ahead of me being not so nice, and treating the lady like she was a nobody. I could see this lady looked to be at retirement age, trying to make ends meet. The look on her face and the energy she gave was that of someone afraid and not knowing where they stood in life. Not to mention the person ahead of me who'd just snatched  a bag back from her and stormed off without even saying thank you. I could tell this woman was hurt by that, and no one knows how many people had been treating her that way all day long.\nWhat if she was a grandmother who'd recently taken care of her grandchildren for whatever season? What if her husband she had to support recently fell sick and they couldn't afford the medical expenses, so she had to go back to work? What if she just lost everything she had in her retirement and now she had to go back to work?\nAll she wants is to do her job and do it well. All she wants is to serve customers the way she was trained. All she needs is to be appreciated. Can I be that someone she needs, just for the moment?\nI looked her in her eyes as she scanned my bag, smiled and said, \"Your hair is beautiful and fits you well!\" Her face lit up and she smiled back and began to tell me how much easier it is to manage. It was salt-and-pepper hair and was cut in the prettiest style. She handed my bag back, smiled and told me the service desk was straight down to my left. I said \"Thank you!\"", "id": "high2740.txt"}
