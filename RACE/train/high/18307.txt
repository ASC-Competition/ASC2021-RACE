The captain then addressed me as if I was his equal, which was very pleasing to a young fellow like me.\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"Mr. Balfour tells me great things of you, and I like your looks. I wish I was staying here longer so that we might become friends. But we'll make the most of the short time that we have. You must come on board my brig   for half an hour and have a drink with me.\"\nNow, I cannot describe how eager I was to see the inside of a ship. But I was not going to put myself in danger, and I told him my uncle and I had an appointment with a lawyer.\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"he told me of that. But, you see, the boat will set you on shore farther along, near Rankeillor's house.\" And here he suddenly leaned down and whispered in my ear: \"Take care; the old devil   has evil plans. Come on board till I can have a word with you.\"\nThen, passing his arm through mine, he continued aloud, as he set off towards his boat: \"Now what can I bring you from Carolina? Any friend of Mr. Balfour can ask for what he likes. A roll of tobacco? Indian feather work? A wild beast's skin? A stone pipe? A mocking-bird that cries just like a cat? Make your choice and give your order.\"\nBy this time we were beside his boat and he was helping me in. I did not dream of refusing. I thought (like a fool) that I had found a friend and helper, and I was looking forward to seeing the ship. As soon as we were all in our places the boat was pushed off and began to move over the water. I was so delighted with this new experience that I hardly understood what the captain said, and must have answered him without thinking.\nAs soon as we were alongside, Hoseason ordered a rope and chair to be sent down, declaring that he and I must be the first to go on board. I was lifted into the air and set down again on the deck  , where the captain stood waiting for me and immediately slipped his arm under mine. I stood there, rather confused and perhaps a little afraid, but delighted with the strange things all around me, while the captain pointed out some of the strangest and told me their names and uses.\nAnd then I saw that my uncle was not with us.\nI felt I was lost. With all my strength, I tore myself out of the captain's grasp and ran to the side of the ship. Yes, there was the boat being rowed back to the shore, with my uncle sitting in it. I gave a wild cry-so loud that it rang out over the harbor, and my uncle turned around and showed me a face full of cruelty and terror.\nThat was the last thing I saw. Already strong hands had been pulling me back from the ship's side, and now lightning seemed to strike me. I saw a great flash of fire, and fell unconscious.", "id": "high18307.txt"}
