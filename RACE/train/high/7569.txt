However,there is no clear structure and effective ways to address midlevel behavior,which may cause a sense of failure in some teachers.\nTeachers also felt that the laws to protect pupils have resulted in a sense of teachers having fewer rights to manage behavior.In case they deal with or be seen to deal with behavior wrongly or improperly,the results could be very serious:damage the child or teacher,especially their career.", "id": "high7569.txt"}
