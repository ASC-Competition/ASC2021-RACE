He wanted nice things and he wanted to get them by himself.He never depended upon us to provide for him.He gladly accepted the room and other different necessities we gave him,but when it came to the luxuries  ,or the extra things of life,he knew he would have to make his own way.\nAt the age of 13,he started talking to me about working.His sister had worked at a local amusement park for several years as her first job so he gave that some thought. He had us drive him to the park and he went in and applied. Within two days he was called back to go to work. His sister had been a model employee and the park didn't even ask what he was able to do.\nHe worked at least 20 hours a week at the local amusement park. With his first week check he came home with a big smile. He had made something like $60 for his four days of afterschool efforts,and he wanted to thank us for our\nhis wealth. He needed transportation both to and from work so we would take him there and back;no matter when the park closed,we would be there.\nWith his very first check,he insisted on treating me and his dad. He took us and his sister to an expensive restaurant. We had a wonderful time there and we spent his entire check. He didn't care;he knew he had to take care of those who had made it possible for him to have the check in the first place. He had always been a generous boy,perhaps too generous sometimes,but very loving.", "id": "high16309.txt"}
