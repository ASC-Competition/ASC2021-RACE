They needed the quiet.So I went there to find peace with the cows, goats, horses, pigs and yes, the turkeys.You'd think being this close to \"Thanksgiving\", they'd be a little scared, but they were not.\nIt was in the dairy barn where I found peace this time.I so admired the young folks who tended to farm animals.I thought they had a greater appreciation for life.They participated in it firsthand.I once watched a young farmer help bring a baby cow into the world.\nMy favorite scene was to come across a young cowboy lying in the hay asleep among the cows that had settled down for a rest.There, with his heads in a small soft spot alongside his favorite cow,    I had seen him in a much deserved sleep.Perhaps better at rest there than in his own bed.\nI had the pleasure of speaking with a young teenage farm girl that day.\n\"You look so comfortable,\" I said to her.\n\"Oh I am,\" she said.\"Life makes it comfortable for me.\"\n\"You mean being a farm girl?\"\n\"No, Life! That's the name of my cow,\" she said, smiling as she gently patted the cow's side.\n\"I thought they called cows Betsy and Elsie.Why did you call her Life?\"\n\"I discovered life again here.It was the only meaningful name that came to mind.I had been raised in the big city and really hated _ .Then we moved to the country, running away from it.I think my parents called it a mid-life crisis,\" she said, laughing.\n\"Oh, I can understand that.I've been in one since birth,\" I said.\n\"It was on the farm that I learned to love life again.I was there when Life was born.It was so exciting.My whole outlook on the world changed.So I named her Life.Now, I can say I really love 'Life',\" she said.\n\"How amazing! I write stories and J am always trying to get people to enjoy life, to wake up each day expecting the best from it.But they all too often go to bed with so much bad stuff in their soul, and on their mind, that they wake up feeling bad and expect it to only get worse from there. All too often it does, just because that's all they choose to see in that otherwise perfectly beautiful day,\" I told her.\n\"That's too bad.They need to see a cow born, a chicken hatch.I guess they need to wake up early and hug Life!\" she said, laughing.\n\"When was the last time you hugged Life\" she asked me.\n\"I am sorry to say even I have had trouble doing that lately,\" I said.\n\"Come here!\" she said.\nThen standing up and stepping aside, she said, \"Go ahead...hug Life!\"\nI paused for a moment and dropping all thoughts of looking silly, I did.I hugged a cow.", "id": "high9166.txt"}
