And yet the way we behave in lifts, or elevators as they are known in the US, reveals a hidden anxiety.\nPassengers seem to know instinctively  how to arrange themselves in an elevator, like the dots on a die. With each additional passenger, the bodies shift, going into the open spaces.\nOn your own, you can do whatever you want--it's your own little box. If there are two of you, you take different corners, creating the greatest distance. When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle. And when there is a square, with someone in every corner, a fifth person is probable going to have to stand in the middle.\nWhy are we so awkward in lifts?\n\"You don't have enough space,\" says Professor Babette Renneberg, a clinical psychologist at the Free University of Berlin. \"Usually when we meet other people we have about an arm's length of distance between us. And that's not possible in most elevators, so it's a very unusual setting. It's unnatural.\"\nBut perhaps there is more to it than just social awkwardness.\n\"In the back of our minds we are a little anxious,\" says Nick White, an officer in New York who was unfortunate enough to be trapped in a lift for 41 hours. \"We don't like to be locked into a place. We want to get out of the elevator as soon as possible, you know, it's a frightening place to be.\"\nDuring his terrible experience, he began to think of another enclosed space--a tomb.\nDr. Lee Gray agrees that a sense of powerlessness is the main cause of lift anxiety.\n\"You're in a machine that's moving, over which you have no control. You cannot see the elevator engine, you don't know how it's working.\" he says.", "id": "high24030.txt"}
