I always put their needs before my own.They took advantage of that.\n    The next day,when the kids were at school, I headed for the movie theater--alone.I'd never been to the movies alone before.Would I look pitiful going to the theater by myself? Was I being silly by seeing a movie when so much work awaited me at home? I forced myself to take back these thoughts.And then I walked into the theater with my head held high and enjoyed every minute of the movie.For a couple of hours, I was nobody's wife or mother.I was just myself.\n    From that point on,I decided that Fridays would be mine,at least for a couple of hours.Some Fridays, I head for the beach with a good book.Other Fridays, I go shopping.I really look forward to my Fridays after a long week of caring for my family.\n    By forcing myself to slow down and put the needs of my family out of my mind, I feel closer to myself.I'm not completely responsible for caring for my family.I don't need to do it all myself. I just need to remember to spare some time to be with myself.", "id": "high23806.txt"}
