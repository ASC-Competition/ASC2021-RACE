But it may take a long time .After, more than 200 yeas separated Einstein from his nearest rival , Isaac Newton. Many physicists say the next Einstein hasn't been yet, or is a baby now.\n      And researchers say there are many factors working against another Einstein emerging anytime soon. For one thing, physics is a much different field today. In Einstein's day, there were only a few thousand physicists worldwide, and the theoreticians who could intellectually rival Einstein probably would fit into a streetcar with seats to spare. Education is different, too. One essential aspect of Einstein's training that is overlooked is the years of philosophy he read as a teenager--Kant, Schopenhauer and Spinoza, among others, It taught him how to think independently and abstractly about space and time. Einstein was also an accomplished musician. The interplay between music and math is well known. Einstein would furiously play his violin as a way to think through a knotty physics problem. Today, universities have produced millions of physicists. There aren't many jobs in science for them, so they go to Wall Street and Silicon Valley to apply their analytical skills to more practical and rewarding efforts.\n      \"Maybe there is an Einstein out there today,\" said Columbia University physicist Brian Greene, \"but it would be a lot harder for him to be heard.\" Especially considering what Einstein was promoting. \"The actual structure of space and time bending? My God, what an idea!\" Greene said at a recent gathering at the Aspen Institute. \"It takes a certain type of person who will knock his head against the wall because you believe you'll find the solution.\" Perhaps the best examples are the five scientific papers Einstein wrote in his \"miracle year\" of 1905. These\" thought experiments\" were pages of calculations signed and submitted to the prestigious   journal Annalen der Physik by an unknown.What might happen to such a submission today? \"We all get papers like those in the mail,\" Greene said. \"We put them in the junk file.\"", "id": "high22031.txt"}
