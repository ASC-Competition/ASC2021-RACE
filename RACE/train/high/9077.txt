He has a good heart,but always afraid to apply for a new job.\nOne day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appoint--ment was at 10 a.m. and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tyre of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man askedhim how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said,\"Well, Icould take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist.\"Jimmy agreed.\nUpon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked,\"Do you really need to be interviewed?\"Jimmy's heart sank.\"With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?\"He thought to himself.\nThen the interviewer turned the chair and to Jimmy's surprise, it was the old man he helped earlier in the morning.\n\"Sorry I had to keep you waiting, but I was pretty sure I made the right decision to have you as part of our workforce before you even stepped into this office. I just know you'd be a trustworthy worker. Congratulations!\"Jimmy sat down and they shared a cup of well-deserved coffee .", "id": "high9077.txt"}
