If so, please take a moment and glance around you. Are there photos of your last vacation hung on the wall? One of your kid's drawings? A yellowed print of a favorite cartoon?\nIf so, you are doing something good for both yourself and your organization. Newly published research suggests working in an environment that offers little privacy can lead to emotional exhaustion and burnout . But personalizing one's workplace is an effective protection against such unwanted outcomes.\n\"Individuals may take comfort from the items with which they surround themselves at work, and these items may help employees to keep emotional energy high in the face of stresses that come from their work,\" writes a research team led by Gregory Laurence of the University of Michigan-Flint, Michigan, in north central U.S.\nIn the Journal of Environmental Psychology, Laurence and his colleagues describe a study featuring 87 white-collar employees at a large, urban university in the Midwestern United States.\nResearch assistants noted whether they worked in a private office (with a door that can be closed) or a cubicle. They also counted the number of items each worker had brought from home to decorate his or her workspace - a list that included photographs, posters, artworks.\nNot surprisingly, Laurence and his colleagues found a connection between the amount of privacy an employee enjoys and his or her rate of burnout. \"High privacy conditions tend to serve as strong protectors against unwelcome interferences and distractions ,\" they noted, \"contributing to a work environment supporting reduced emotional exhaustion.\"\nBut this link disappeared when those employees had personalized their cubicles. Employees who had turned their workspaces into areas that reflect their interests and personalities reported the same (relatively low) level of emotional exhaustion, no matter whether they worked in an office or a cubicle.\nThe research confirms \"the calming effect\" of having your own stuff around you. So if you're feeling exhausted at work, relief could be as simple as hanging a few of your kindergartener's colorful creations on your cubicle wall.", "id": "high16265.txt"}
