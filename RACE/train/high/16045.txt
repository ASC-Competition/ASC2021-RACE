Two of the rescuers, Liu Ye and Hao Longbiao, also died of cold and tiredness.\nThe body of Hao who took the lead in jumping into the lake was not found until the next day.\nA student who was unwilling to tell his name said he and his classmates from the local college were taking photos at the lake. When they heard the children's cries for help, they went to the ice hole hand in hand to rescue the children.
