They used to manage the home and look after children. They were free of the responsibility of earning money to support the family, which was left to men.\nWith the coming of industrialization   and technological development, the lifestyles of human beings started to change. The needs of human beings started to grow. In this process, women slowly started to move outside the home. Women received the same education as men. Gradually, women slowly started to think independently and participated equally with men in all fields of life, including politics, sports and even military.\nWith changing environments, the role of women has become more important in society. To match today's standard of living, it is necessary for both men and women to support the family.\nToday, women have been given bigger roles to play in society.
