One can imagine villages in India and Africa soon purchasing an affordable basic power system based on this technology.\"\nThe leaf is like the shape of a poker card but thinner.Placed in water in a bright sunlight,it could produce enough electricity to supply a house in a developing country with electricity for a day by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, which are stored in a fuel cell to produce electricity.\nThe\"artificial leaf\"is not a new concept.The first artificial leaf was developed more than a decade ago by John Ttlrner.However, it was impractical for wider use,as it was composed of rare,expensive metals and was highly unstable with a lifespan of barely one day.\nNocera's new leaf overcomes these problems.It is made of inexpensive materials that are widely available,works under simple conditions and is highly stable.Laboratory studies showed that it could operate continuously for at least 45 hours without a drop in activity.\nThe key to this breakthrough is Nocera's recent discovery of several new powerful, inexpensive catalysts,which are able to accelerate the chemical reaction under simple conditions.Right now, Nocera's leaf is about 10 times more efficient at carrying out photosynthesis than a natural leaf.Yet he is optimistic that he can boost the efficiency of the device much higher in the future.", "id": "high18659.txt"}
