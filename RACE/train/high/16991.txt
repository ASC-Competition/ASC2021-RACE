Later she got into some kind of audient and lost her entire left arm. She was depressed for a few years.Then someone asked her to coach a children's dancing group. From that point on, she realized she could not forget dancing.\nShe still loved to dance.She wanted to dance again.So she started to do some of her old routines. But by her losing an arm,She also lost her balance.\nIt took a while before she could even make simple turns without falling.\nEventually she got it.\nThen she heard some guy in his 20s had lost a 1eg in an accident.This guy also fell into depression and anger. She looked him up and persuaded him to dance with her. He had never danced! \"And to dance with one leg ? Are you joking with me?\n\"No way,\" he replied.\nBut she didn't give up. He reluctantly agreed, \"I have nothing else to do anyway.\"She started to teach him dancing.The two fell down a few times because the guy had no concept of using muscle, controlling his body,and a few other basic things about dancing.When she became frustrated and lost patience with him,he would walk out.\nLater they got back together again and started training. They hired a choreographer to design routines for them.She would fly high,held by him with both arms, flying in the air. He could bend,supported by one leg and she was leaning on him,etc.They danced beautifully and they beat other students in the competition.\nI would like to share with you the most magnificent an touching performance I have ever seen! It is a living proof that strong spirit can conquer physical limitations!", "id": "high16991.txt"}
