Only two people in the world still speak it, and they won't talk to each other.\nSpoken in Mexico for centuries, Ayapaneco is one of 68 surviving languages in the mainly Spanish-speaking nation. The two speakers are Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez. Though they live only 500 meters from each other in the village, the two men seldom talk to each other. Daniel, an American expert, who is working to make a dictionary of Ayapaneco, says the two men \"don't have a lot in common,\" and that Segovia can be \"active\" while Velasquez tends to mind his own business and stay at home.\nWhile Segovia still speaks to his wife and son in Ayapaneco, neither of them can manage more than a few words. Velasquez hardly speaks his native tongue any more. Daniel is working to preserve the language in dictionary form before its last surviving speakers pass away. According to Daniel, Ayapaneco and the other languages began dying out with the introduction of public Spanish education in the mid-20thcentury. For decades, local children weren't allowed to speak anything else. Many people to cities, starting in the 1970s, also helped the dying out of native languages.\nAyapaneco is the name given to the language; Segovia and Velazquez call it \"Nuumte Oote\", which means \"true voice\". Neither man, however, speaks the same language. The dictionary will contain two versions  of the language when it comes out later this year. Those behind the dictionary aren't the only ones trying to save Ayapaneco. The National Language Institute plans to hold classes so that Segovia and Velasquez can pass on what they know to children.\nIt is thought that there are about 6,000 languages spoken on earth and that about half will disappear over the next 100 years. Let's hope the \"true voice\" isn't one of them.", "id": "high5723.txt"}
