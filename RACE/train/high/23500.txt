The most domestic activities are the most popular: watching TV, listening to the radio, reading, DIY (Do It Yourself) and gardening. Even when the English are being sociable, the survey findings show that most of them would much rather entertain a few close friends or  s in the safety of their own homes than venture out among strangers.\nIn the latest rational census survey  , over half of the entire adult male population had been DIYing in the four weeks before the census date. Nearly a third of the female population had also been busily improving their homes, and their work with their gardens was equally obvious: 52 percent of all English males and 45 percent of females had been out there, cutting branches and weeding grass.\nEven among people claiming to belong to a particular religion, only two percent attend services every week. The rest of the population can be found every Sunday at their local garden center or DIY superstore. And when they want a break from caring about their own homes and gardens, they go on trips to visit bigger and better houses and gardens, such as the stately homes and gardens opened to the public by the National Trust and the Royal Horticulture Society. Visiting grand country houses always ranks as one of the most popular national pastimes.", "id": "high23500.txt"}
