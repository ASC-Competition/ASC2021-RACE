But psychologists say it could lead to later emotional and behavioral problems.\n     Even children who were only spanked some of time are more likely to show signs of sadness or have less confidence.\n   \"The key is to be fair and do the same thing each time. Doing something like hitting a child that seems cruel at best doesn't help and can put a child at risk for problems,\" said Dr Paul Frick, of theprefix = st1 /UniversityofNew Orleansin Louisians.\n   \"It is better to use other punishments,\" he added.\n   The use of physical punishment to teach children has long been debated. In countries such asAustria,Finland,GermanyandSweden, it is illegal to use physical punishment at home or in schools.\n   Frick and his team, who studied the effects of physical punishment on 98 children, said they couldn't find any positive effects. Some children learned more from the hitting than what the parent was trying to teach them.\n   \"The key is to have a lot of different forms of punishment depending on the age of the child,\" said Frick, who reported his findings in the Journal of Applied Child Psychology.\n   He recommended time out for younger children and taking away television and electronic toys for older children. Giving extra chores can also get the message across.\n   Other measures are at least as effective as physical punishment and have less harmful potential consequences.\n   The researchers kept children whom they thought were at risk of later conduct problems out of the test and an equal number of other children who acted as a control group, to study what measures would be most helpful.\n   They questioned the parents and the children about positive and negative parenting behavior including the use of physical punishment.\n   \"We got it from both viewpoints,\" said Frick.\n   He added that children on the receiving end of a hit can learn that when they are upset and angry they hit, rather than understanding their behavior was wrong and that they need to do better.", "id": "high24156.txt"}
