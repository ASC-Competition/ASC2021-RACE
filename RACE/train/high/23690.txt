Just recently, a man was arrested for doing just that. At that time, he was sitting in the street with a laptop  and using an unsecured  wireless connection to surf the Net. What do you think about this topic? Listen to the following different views on it.\nFor a start, if someone is using your Internet service or downloading, this will affect your speed of access or download limit. Also, it's bad for Internet service providers. They will suffer in the long run because fewer people will pay for an Internet service if they know they can get it for free. And finally, just imagine this: what if the person who is stealing your Internet connection is involved in an illegal activity? I think the police are totally right to arrest these criminals.\n                                      -- by Sandra Wilkins\nBasically, if the person who paid for the service still has everything they paid for, what's the problem? It's just like using the light from streetlamps to read your book, or watching someone else's firework display. It's not stealing.\nAlso, if you leave your wireless connection unsecured, then it is your own fault  if someone else uses it. Just as you wouldn't leave your front door unlocked, or your car door open, neither should you leave your wireless connection open. By leaving your wireless connection open, you are inviting people to use it. Securing your wireless connection is as easy as clicking a few settings on your router . And finally, haven't the police got more important crimes to solve? They're always saying how they haven't got the manpower to solve real issues. But this is just ridiculous .\n                                      -- by James Hoarley", "id": "high23690.txt"}
