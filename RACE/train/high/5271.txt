Many colleges and universities are offering online courses and degree programs now.\nOnline Learning Programs\nWith a computer and an Internet connection, you can earn a degree from home, work, or anywhere else for that matter. Online degree programs follow much the same routines as traditional learning, with a few twists. There are lectures, but they won't be in person. There are assignments   , but you won't hand them to your instructor. In most situations, you are free to \"go to class\" when it fits your\"schedule. If you get a phone call during class, you don't have to miss anything. If you get sick, you don't have to ask for someone's notes, and you just visit the lecture later.\nYou'll communicate with your instructor by e-mail, chat room and instant messaging. Your  classroom will live in a special software program. Contrary to popular belief, you will have close  contact with other students and the instructor.\nEvaluating the Program\nThere are a lot of questions to ask before you make your selection, such as:\nHow do students interact with each other?\nOnline programs can use chat rooms, instant messaging, teleconferencing, and video conferencing to communicate. The key is to find a program that has this interaction built into it and even requires it.\nWhat kind of reputation does the school have?\nIt may seem simple-a good school will have a good online program. This reputation,however, may not be as straightforward as you think. It's not uncommon for a great school to have a weak program or two. So you'd better look at the overall quality of the school and make a judgment.\nThe Employers' View\nAs more and more employees get online degrees and use them in the workforce  ,  hiring managers will begin to feel more secure about the quality of education these people have.", "id": "high5271.txt"}
