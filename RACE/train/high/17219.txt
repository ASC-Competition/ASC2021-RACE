Anita Kelly, study author and professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame, recruited 110 adults for her study. She divided them into two groups and asked one group to stop lying for 10 weeks. Lies included big ones and tiny ones--any false statement--but participants were still allowed to leave out the truth, keep secrets and avoid questions they didn't want to answer, etc. The other group wasn't given any special instructions about lying. \nIt turns out that both groups reduced their lying, but those who were specifically told to tell the truth improved their health more. \"We found that the participants could purposefully and dramatically reduce their everyday lies, and that in turn was associated with significantly improved health,\" said Kelly.\nWhen participants in the no-lie group told three fewer white lies than they did in other weeks, they experienced, on average, fewer mental-health complaints and physical complaints. They were less likely to feel tense or sad and also experienced fewer sore throats and headaches. They also reported that personal relationships improved. Additionally, participants found themselves being honest about their daily accomplishments, and they stopped making up excuses for being late or failing to complete a task, for example. \n\"It's certainly a worthy goal to have people be more honest and interact with others in a more honest way,\" says psychologist Robert Feldman. \"That would be beneficial. I'm a little doubtful that it makes us all healthier, but it may make us healthier in a psychological way.\"", "id": "high17219.txt"}
