Andrew McAfee explains his view in his new book Race Against the Machine.\" Advances in self-driving car by Google represent the next wave of job-eliminating technology.Many skills (such as driving) may eventually become worthless, at least in the job market.\"\nAnd as for those thinking that driverless cars might appeal to most motorists, there is the uncomfortable fact that the car has peaked.We are driving less year on year.Traffic jams reduce the romance from driving.And young people no longer have the desire to own cars like they used to.", "id": "high17499.txt"}
