Two other women quit after a single day with injured muscles. \"Now they're going to have to change the word from gripman to grip person, just because of me,\" Barnes said earlier, \"I'm so excited.\"\nAfter almost a year of serious workouts, Barns can pull more than 61 kilos, only 23 kilos less than her body weight. And she'll need the muscle, for this is no modern, push-button technology. Every time a car starts up again after making a stop, the gripman must haul back on a lever controlling a device that grips the cable, which runs continuously at 14 kilometers per hour. If the grip slips, so does the car. A second person operates the brakes.\nIn addition to having to throw her weight around on the job, she's got to throw out some attitude to men who were hard to convince. The city employs 76 men in the job.\n\"A lot of men said mean things to me and didn't want to help train me. But I would like to thank the guys who were against me because they gave me even more inspiration to do it.\" she said.\nNot all the men were against her. Many of the male colleagues yelled out support as she did her training runs. One of her biggest tests was drizzly December morning. She first went down the Hyde Street Hill, considered the most dangerous incline on the cable car routes. \"I had to have the will and I had to believe I could do it,\" she said. \"It was scary, but as I started going down full grip and felt that I was in control, I knew I was on my way,\" Barnes already is a pioneer of sorts. She started working as a cable car conductor six years ago, collecting fares and assisting on the back brake. She is one of only three women to have that job. But she said she always wanted the job up front on the car. (400)", "id": "high16218.txt"}
