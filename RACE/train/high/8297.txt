Once I had a beautiful watch. And it had kept perfect time. But one night it happened that I forgot to _ it _  . Next morning I went to a watchmaker as I wanted my perfect watch to be set by the exact time. He examined it and said, \"The regulator   must be pushed up as your watch is four minutes slow.\nI tried to stop him from doing so, but he didn't listen and pushed the regulator.\nMy beautiful watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. By the end of the second month it had left all the clocks and watches of the town far behind.\nI could do nothing but take it to another watchmaker to be regulated. I expected him to regulate the watch at once, but he asked me to come in a week's time. When at last I got my watch back from him, it began to slow down. And I failed to be in time for trains, business affairs, and even missed my dinners.\nNow I went to a third watchmaker. When I was waiting for him to repair my poor watch, he took it to pieces and said that he would try to finish this work in three or four days. What I could do was to nod my head. After that, my watch went for half a day, and then stopped. So I kept taking my watch from one watchmaker to another. But each watchmaker disappointed me.\nMy watch had cost me two hundred dollars, but I paid for repairs more than two hundred. At last I decided to buy another watch, which I did.", "id": "high8297.txt"}
