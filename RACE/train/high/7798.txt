When we think of the first thing on land, we probably think of strange animals coming out of the oceans, but in fact no animals could have been living if plants had not been on land first. Plants had to be on land before animals arrived. They supplied the first land animals with the surrounding and food necessity, since they, the plants, are the only form of life that is able to get and store energy.\nThe first plants to exist out of the water were probably certain kinds of algae which were followed by other plants that grew close to the ground and needed water in which to reproduce. Once the move to land had been made, however, evolution took place quickly. By the end of 100 million years, plants had developed their roots ,and some had got tree -like forms since height was very important in gaining sunlight. About 300 million years ago, much of the world was covered with forests of huge trees. In most ways they were like modern trees. They had roots, leaves, wood, but mostly they had not developed seeds.", "id": "high7798.txt"}
