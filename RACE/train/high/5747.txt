Those four flights together held over 1000 passengers and there were only 266 aboard.\nHe was on 4 commercial flights giving frightened passengers the ability to stay calm. Not one of the family members who were called by a loved one on one of the hijacked  planes said that passengers were screaming in the background. On one of the flights he was giving strength to passengers to try to overtake the hijackers.\nHe was busy trying to create obstacles  for employees at the World Trade Center. After all, only around 20,000 were at the towers when the first jet hit. Since the buildings held over 50,000 workers, this was a _ in itself. How many of the people who were employed at the World Trade Center told the media that they were late for work or they had traffic delays.\nHe was holding up 2-110 story buildings so that 2/3 of the workers could get out. I was so amazed that the top of the towers didn't fall when the jets crashed. And when they did fall, GOD made them fall inward, as many more lives would have been lost.\nSo when anyone asks, \"Where was your GOD on September 11,\" you can say \"everywhere\"! And yes, although this is without a doubt the worst thing I have seen in my life, I see God's miracles in every bit of it. I can't imagine going through such a difficult time and not believing in GOD - life would be hopeless. So shines a good deed in a weary world!", "id": "high5747.txt"}
