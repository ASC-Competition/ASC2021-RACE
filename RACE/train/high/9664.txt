Since that ground-breaking moment, more than four million babies have been born through IVF and in 2010 his great contribution to science was finally recognized as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine.\nThe prize for Dr Edwards, who was given a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award in 2008, includes a PS900,000 cheque. The Nobel Assembly described IVF as a \"milestone in modern medicine\".\nWith the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, the Manchester-born physiologist developed IVF -- leading to the birth of the world's first test tube baby. Dr Steptoe died 10 years later but their work has transformed fertility treatment and given hope to millions of couples.\nIt was a scientific breakthrough that transformed the lives of millions of couples. They said: \"His achievements have made it possible to treat infertility, a disease which makes human unable to have a baby. This condition has been afflicting a large percentage of mankind including more than 10% of all couples worldwide.\"\nLouise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, made international headlines when she was born in Oldham, Gtr Manchester, in 1978 to parents Lesley and John who had been fruitlessly trying for a baby since 1969.\nIvf-in-vitro fertilisation is the process whereby egg cells are fertilised outside the body before being implanted in the womb. After a cycle of IVF, the probability of a couple with infertility problems having a baby is one in five -- the same as healthy couples who conceive naturally.\nProfessor Edwards, who has five daughters and 11 grandchildren, began his research at Cambridge University in 1963, after receiving his PhD in 1955.He once said: \"The most important thing in life is having a child. Nothing is more special than a child.\" With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, Prof. Edwards founded the Bourn Hall clinic in Cambridge shire, which now treats more than 900 women a year. Each year, more than 30,000 women in Britain now undergo IVF and 11,000 babies are born as a result of the treatment.\nBut his work attracted widespread criticism from some scientists and the Catholic Church who said it was \"unethical and immoral\".\nMartin Johnson, professor of reproductive  sciences at the University of Cambridge, said the award was \"long overdue\". He said: \"We couldn't understand why the Nobel has come so late but he is delighted -- this is the cherry on the cake for him.\"\nProfessor Edwards was too ill to give interviews but a statement released by his family said he was \"thrilled and delighted\".", "id": "high9664.txt"}
