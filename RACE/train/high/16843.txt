This meaning of the word is  ly new in English,but not as new as you might think.The earliest record found so far is from 1884 in the phrase\"Dat's  cool!\"\nKick the Bucket\n   This means\"to die\".Many people consider the term to have come from a guilty man standing on an upturned bucket which was then kicked out from under his feet leaving him to hang,but there is no written evidence that this is the case.In fact,it is more likely from a different type of bucket entirely.In butchery ,when a pig was killed it would be hung from a pole.It is mostly likely that in his death throes ,the pig's  feet would bang against the rail to which they were tied.Therefore,kicking the bucket was a term referring to the last actions of the pig before he finally died.\nBob's  Your Uncle\n    Bob's your uncle generally means that something is simple or easy or a\"job done\".It is most likely that this phrase came about as a result of nepotism .In the late 1800s, Lord Salisbury(first name Robert)was prime-minister of Great Britain.After his third term he was  _ by his nephew Arthur.Arthur had been made Chief Secretary of Ireland in 1886. Suspicions arose that Robert was favoring his nephew Arthur.The term\"Bob's  your uncle\"could be used at the time as a reference to this charge of nepotism.", "id": "high16843.txt"}
