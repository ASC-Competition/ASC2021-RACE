Dai's new home costs him 6,400 yuan and he has been living in it for nearly two months in a courtyard at Chengfu Road, Haidian district.\n     Dai, who is one of the millions of migrants who moved to the capital from other parts of China seeking a better life and better job, said he realized his financial burden had become too great. The Hunan native said he simply could not make ends meet  when he became an intern at a Beijing-based construction design company in 2009.\n   \"I rented a home at the very beginning--a small room in an apartment that cost me about 900 yuan per month,\" said Dai in an interview with local media. \"It was too expensive for me.\" \nDai's father works on a construction site in his hometown and his mother is a cleaner. \n     Dai, who ended up becoming a formal employee of the company, figured out his own way to solve the problem---with inspiration from a housing design project at his company's exhibition early this year. The project, named \"An egg given birth to by the city\", included a series of egg-like movable houses, with a karaoke house, chair house and trader's house in it. \n   Dai, who borrowed 6,400 yuan from an older cousin and who got additional help from several friends, decided to make one of his own. He spent nearly two months building his \"egg house\" in his hometown, a village in southeast Hunan that is around 1, 700 kilometers from Beijing.", "id": "high17470.txt"}
