But when women expressed anger , they were viewed as more emotional and , thus , less convincing . In other words , a man could benefit from using anger in power and persuasion . A woman , however , could be ignored or hurt by her group if she expressed anger .\nThe study was based on the responses of 210 students . They were shown evidence and photographs online from a real murder trial . A man had supposedly murdered his wife . The students were asked to decide if the man was guilty or not .\nBefore making their decision , the students discussed the case online with five jurors . But these were not real jurors ; they were computers generating responses and comments back to the students . Some of the fake jurors had male identities . Others had female identities .\nSome male jurors were angry about the judgement . When this happened , the students reacted by doubting their own decisions about the case . Confidence in their responses on the judgement \" dropped significantly \" . But when female jurors seemed angry , the student participants \" became significantly more confident in their original judgments \" .\nThe study could have wider importance .\nThe results have effects for any woman who is trying to exert influence on a decision in their workplace and everyday lives . This includes governing bodies , task forces and committees . In a political debate , a female candidate might have less influence if she shows anger .\nAn example is the 2016 Democratic presidential race . This might explain why Bernie Sanders is able to freely express his passion and conviction , while Hillary Clinton clearly regulates her emotions more carefully .", "id": "high19466.txt"}
