It is a holiday paradise . The self-styled 'Ultimate Island' certainly has plenty for everyone.\nWhere in the world ?\nBali is located just off the eastern edge of the main Indonesian island of Java. To the east is the neighboring island of Lombok. To the south of Bali lies the expanse of the Indian Ocean, while to the north is the Bali Sea. The most popular resort with holidaymakers is Ubud north of Sanur.\nWhen to go?\nBali has a tropical climate year round with an average daily temperature of 31degC(87degCF). The wet season is between October and April. The dry season is between May and September, and is the busiest time to visit the island as travelers take advantage of the long hot days and little rain.\nBeach\nBali has a string of beaches, mainly in the south of the island. Head away from Bali's beaches and a totally different world awaits you. Ubud is an easily accessible  jungle resort town with a good range of hotels, shops and restaurants. The active volcano of Mount Batur is a highlight and so are the mountain lakes.\nFamily fun\nAll of the resorts have plenty of facilities  for families. In Ubud there is a monkey park, where young ones can see monkeys that are not kept in tiny cages and an elephant park where holidaymakers can ride an elephant.\nEating out\nAll of Bali's holiday resorts offer international cooking to suit every tourist's taste, with most of the better hotels having excellent restaurants. Indonesian Bintang beer is very popular.\nGetting around\nThere are a limited number of local buses. The other public transport is to take the local \"bemo\" minibuses. These colourful little minibuses speed around the winding roads with fares negotiated  on board, so it helps to speak a little of the local language. There are also taxis and both electric bikes and cars can be hired.", "id": "high624.txt"}
