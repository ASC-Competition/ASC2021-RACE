I can keep and share memories of my high school on the Internet.\"You may often hear this from many American high school students now. Instead of buying a book, more and more students choose to sign up at My Yearbook.com.\nMy Yearbook.com was created by two teenagers, Catherine Cook and her brother, 18-year-old David Cook, in 2005. They built it up to about 950,000 members in a year. The site allows people to create a profile with separate sections for high school, college, graduate school and professional life. Students who sign up are linked to other people at their school. Acting as their own editors, they can select friends from their classmates. The site also connects students through clubs and spprts pages. Like other so-called social-networking sites, it allows members to show photos and post messages. Students can do lots of things that old-fashioned yearbooks can't offer, including hearing music and watching videos.\nCatherine and David developed the idea because they thought that their own yearbooks weren't good enough and were too expensive. \"We just think yearbooks are obsolete,\" said Catherine Cook, 16.\"If you think about it, all you're going to do with it is put it on the shelf and never really look at it.\" Many American teenagers want different things out of their yearbooks than their parents did. They like the idea of creating an online yearbook. That is the reason why My Yearbook.com is becoming more and more popular.\nSome people, however, still wonder if this free website can ever truly replace the traditional printed book of high-school memories-even for the generation that have grown up with the Internet. Some students would like to be the users of the My Yearbook.com as well as buy a traditional yearbook. The\"war\" between the tradition and the new technology will never end. Everyone is free to choose what he prefers and even has both.", "id": "high23148.txt"}
