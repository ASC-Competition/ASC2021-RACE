They make the teaching or training activities more interesting. They are useful in all fields of teaching and training.\nHelp your child discover just how much more is going on in the world around them with this listening game. It will also provide a few minutes of peace and quiet in what is probably a very noisy and busy day. A discussion of the sounds you each hear will also assist in language development and an ability to articulate that which was heard. The sit-and-listen game is especially helpful if your child is at the stage of developing language skills: listening, speaking and so on.\nMethod: This is a very relaxing activity in which you both need to sit still and silent for about 30 seconds and just listen to the world around you. You are both trying to hear as many different things as you can, whether they are cars, people, airplanes, water running, the wind in the trees or any other kinds of daily sounds.\nAfter the given time is up, having a chat about what you both could hear. It is a good idea to ask your little one some open ended questions to promote their language development, such as: \"What were the loudest sounds you heard?\" \"What were the closest sounds you heard?\" \"How many cars did you hear?\" \"How far away do you think that barking dog might live?\" \"What sounds did you hear which you did not expect to hear?\"\nNote: As an extension activity you may wish to draw a picture of all the things you could hear.", "id": "high19046.txt"}
