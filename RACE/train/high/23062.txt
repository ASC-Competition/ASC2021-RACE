In old plays of long ago,evil characters usually wore black. In cowboy movies the\"bad guys\"usually wear black hats while the\"good guys\"wear lighter color1s.Something else about their appearance makes an unfavorable impression.  In their practical,protective clothing they look very much like the men on military motorcycles in the movies of World War II--cruel enemies who roared into peaceful villages filling people's hearts with fear.\nProbably the machine itself also produces anger and fear. Motorcycles are noisy,though some big trucks are even noisier.But trucks are big and carry heavy loads;they are accepted(if not really welcomed)because they perform a needed service,making America move.Motorcycles,on the other hand,make all unpleasant noise just to give their riders pleasure.That is what is commonly thought.In the woods motorcycles,frighten animals.Roaring along quiet streets, they wake sleeping families and make babies cry.\nOf course the danger of motorcycling,also helps account for many people's low opinion of the sport.Its defenders, however,claim that careful cyclists are in less danger than commonly behaved.\nA cyclist must drive as if everybody around him wanted to kill him.He must pay careful attention to his driving.From that point of view,a man on a motorcycle is safer than,a man in a car.", "id": "high23062.txt"}
