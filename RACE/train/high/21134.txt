We will also be looking to run other additional services to meet demand as required. At this stage we will run services stopping at all stations which will depart at the same time on the hour, however, this is all subject to the weather conditions and the availability of traincrew.\"\nMr Scurrah encouraged all customers to visit the Translink website for specific departure times for their station, and asked for patience in the event of delays.\n\"Queensland Rail appreciates that reduced services may cause disruptions but it is simply unavoidable. We have a dedicated and experienced team monitoring the situation around the clock and will be working to reopen the network as soon as practicably possible,\" Mr Scurrah said.\nThe latest service disruption information is available on the TransLink website www.translink.com.au.", "id": "high21134.txt"}
