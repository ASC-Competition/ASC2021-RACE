As well as ecological values, they can also offer economical  returns.\nIn recent years,many wetlands have become farmland.Drawing too much underground water,hunting and fishing also ruin their ecological system.\nEvery year,the wetlands in the Sanjiang Plain of  Northeast China provide habitat for birds.Local residents search the area for the birds' eggs. They consider the eggs to be a natural gift. rather than wildlife that should be protected. If they were educated,perhaps this is one activity that could be brought to an end.\nChina is now ready to make a plan to save some of these areas.Some have been restored to raise awareness among the public.But these moves are not enough.There should be laws in place to provide legal support to the fight. Environment protection is a campaign which needs support from everyone in society.Education may be the first step.", "id": "high16988.txt"}
