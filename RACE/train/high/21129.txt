Regular family meals were found to have a protective effect regardless of the age, weight, socioeconomic status, dieting habit or relationship with the family.\nBelinda Dalton, director of the eating disorder clinic The Oak House, said eating with family helped \"normalize\" young people's relationship with food.\n\"When teens are feeling that they are not managing, they turn to something that they can control and food is something available and accessible for them to control. Clearly, if they are sitting with their family on a regular basis, then their family can be more in control of their eating,\" Ms Dalton said.\n\"It's about young people feeling connected within their family, and  _ builds self-esteem and a sense of worth and works very actively against someone developing an eating disorder.\nAn eating disorder expert, Kirsty Greenwood, said meal times were often difficult for sufferers. \"It's typical that they feel very ashamed of their eating habits and often won't eat with other people. Perhaps it's because they haven't experienced the important of the family meal while growing up,\" she said.\nThe study found eating regular family meals made no difference to the future eating habits of boys.", "id": "high21129.txt"}
