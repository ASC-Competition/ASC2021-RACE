But for job seekers,especially those with college educations,researchers say finding a job can be as easy as logging on to a computer.It used to be that looking for a job meant hurrying around,knocking on doors and turning to ads.But that's changing,thanks to the Internet.A new report says,for college graduates,looking for a job is getting easier.More than 80 percent of the jobs are available online.\nAt the height of the depression ,when U.S.unemployment peaked at 10 percent,just a little more than two million jobs were being posted each month.But as the recovery takes hold,the job picture looks increasingly bright.\nThat's great news for Hamilton.Only once has he ever applied in person for a job at a shopping mall. He said,\"I think my generation--the idea of going door to door, out knocking and saying,hey are you hiring? --like that--doesn't exist anymore...those days are gone, Just go online.''\nKim Dancy recently graduated with a master's degree in Public Policy.She found her dream job as an education policy researcher.But she says finding the perfect job online takes a lot of perseverance.He said,\"It can be really frustrating and it takes a long time,but if you applied for enough positions and really do your homework you will get somewhere.\nThe report's findings suggest careers in Science,Technology,Engineering and Math provide the greatest opportunities,with salaries that range between  $30 to  $45 an hour.But for maximum income and satisfaction,workers must be prepared to move and change jobs at least every five years.", "id": "high7277.txt"}
