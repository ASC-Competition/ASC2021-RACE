In winter*the lakes often have no ice in the middle. The seasonal winds from the west pick up the slightly warmer wet air from the lake surface. As the slightly warmer wet air passes over the colder land surface, it often produces heavy snowfall. This is similar to the effect of warmer air passing over mountain ranges, which often leads to dropping snow. During the period of freezing weather, the \"snow belt\",caused by the seasonal winds, receives regular snow fall and this phenomenon along the eastern shore forms the localized weather pattern, especially in Michigan, Ohio and so on.\nThe lakes also  _ seasonal temperatures to some degree, by absorbing heat to cool the air in summer and then slowly giving out that heat in autumn. This function of the lakes protects the autumn against frost, and it also keeps the summer time temperatures cooler than further inland. This temperature buffering produces areas known as \"fruit belts\",where fruits typically grown farther south can be produced. That is why some southern fruits like apples ,cherries and grapes can be found in western Michigan near the lake shore as far north as the Grand Traverse Bay. The eastern shore of Lake Michigan and the southern shore of Lake Erie have many wine makers as a result of this.\nHowever ,the lake effect has been found to be related to the occurrence of bad weather. For example, fogs are often formed over medium-sized areas along the shorelines of the lakes. This is most noticeable along Lake Superior's shores ,due to its coastal climate. A case in point is Hurricane Hazel in 1954,and tornadoes in Michigan and Ontario in 2007. Such evidence shows that the lake effect may help strengthen storms.", "id": "high20938.txt"}
