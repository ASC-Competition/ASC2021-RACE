One day he climbed over some rocks. He was looking for some crabs   for supper. He took off  his shorts and put them on a rock.\nThe afternoon went quickly. Time was flying by. Look! The sea was coming in fast. It was over some of the rocks now.\nCharlie looked up. \"It's getting late. Oh dear! Look at the sea. Where are my shorts now?\" he thought. He saw them on a rock.\nOh dear! The rock was an island! Now he must swim and got them.\nCharlie jumped into the sea and started swimming. He reached the rock and put his shorts on his head. Then he started swimming back. Oh no! The sea was too strong for Charlie. It was pulling him away from the beach.\n\"Help!\" he called. \"I can't get back. \"\nLuckily, a boat was coming by. The people in the boat saw Charlie and heard his call for help.\n\"Are you all right?\" asked the woman in the boat.\n\"No! I can't swim back. The sea is too strong. \"\nThe woman stopped the boat and she and a girl pulled Charlie into the boat. He threw his shorts into the boat too. Then they turned the boat Bound and took Charlie back to the beach.\n\"That was lucky,\" said the woman.\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Charlie.\n\"Be careful next time,\" said the woman. \"The sea is usually very strong near these rocks. \"\n\"Next time, I'm going to keep my shorts in my bag,\" said Charlie. \"Better safe than sorry!\"", "id": "high187.txt"}
