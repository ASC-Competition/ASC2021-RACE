And, it has made the word \"me\" one of the most frequently used words. Everything seems to be about \"me\". This generation has a greater awareness of itself. \nSome people do not seem to agree that all this is self-centred. When Cai Fuchao, prefix = st1 /Beijing's publicity head, was asked to comment on the lack of responsibility of university students during the SARS period, his reply was: \"Modern university students are ambitious, knowledgeable and have a very strong sense of responsibility to the society.\" \nAs news analyst from sina.com, Pan Fengliang, echoed that, saying that blindly blaming them(for running away during the SARS outbreak)was prejudiced and unfair and not backed with evidence. \nNo doubt, the development of information technology has contributed its bit to broadening, or bending, the minds of the 80s generation. \nSome people even call Gen'80 \"the E-generation\". They get in touch with each other via email, QQ, ICQ and MSN. \nWhile the people of the '60s and '70s swarmed to Shanghai to catch Luo Dayou, Gen'80s were on the BBS saying that it was \"really dumb\". \n\"The internet is so much more to those of the '80s than you can imagine,\" said Wu Junyong, an IT engineer who was born in 1978. \nIn Wu's opinion, it's the Internet that separates the 70s from the 80s, \"Many of the'70s don't see why those from the '80s can spend everyday in front of a computer.\" \nA new weekly Magazine/163.com survey last year found that 40 percent of the 7,000 people surveyed, born in the '80s, thought the computer was the most important article in life; more than 70 percent of their parents preferred the home.", "id": "high24070.txt"}
