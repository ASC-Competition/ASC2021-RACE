Melina Davis,an education professor,said she likes how the book contains a couple of pages that have only pictures on them. \"This allows children to shape the story themselves,\" she said.\nThe book contains a few of larger words that some parents worry may confuse children,but experts say those words help improve children's reading skills and challenge them.\nDavis said the book is well written which helps kids get involved in the story. \"The book talks about what all children go through,like 'I was naughty but my mommy still loves me'\" Davis said.\nThe book also encourages children to face their fears.\"I think it's really good to show that Max is friends with the monsters,\" Davis said.\"Kids can find out monsters aren't always the thing under the bed that's going to scare them.I think this is good because it shows that the children can go to scary places but still have a positive experience.\"\nSince the book has been successful throughout the years,a movie was recently made and many people are excited to see it.Davis said she thinks the movie will be wonderful but it might be a little scary for younger children.\"You don't want bad dreams over a book that's extremely wonderful'\" Davis said.", "id": "high8412.txt"}
