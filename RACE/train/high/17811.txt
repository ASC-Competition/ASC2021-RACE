He looked across the hills at the little Irish fishing village. It did not seem like Christmas Eve. Perhaps this was because it still had not snowed. But Colin knew there was another reason--a reason he did not dare whisper even in his heart. \nHe looked toward the sea. There was no ship. And seven days ago his father's fishing boat hadn't gone home in time. \"I'll bring you a small sheep dog from the Shetland Isles,\" Colin's father told him the morning he left. But now it was Christmas Eve. Colin looked toward the lighthouse, high on the hill. For seven days, there had been no light to guide his father's ship. \nColin pushed open the door of his cottage. \"We'll need more peat   for the fire, Colin,\" said his mother as he entered. \"It has burned itself out. And it's near time to light the Christmas candle. Everybody in Ireland lights a candle on Christmas Eve, even when there's sadness in the house. It shows that your house and heart are open to strangers. I've two candles, one for each of us. If you gather some peat, we'll be ready for supper soon.\" Colin nodded and went outside. \nHe led their donkey up the hill. But while he was staring at the lighthouse, Colin had an idea. He came to the lighthouse and knocked on the door. \nMr. Duffy, the keeper, opened the door. \"What's up, young man?\"\n\"Mr. Duffy,\" said Colin, \"what did you use to light the lighthouse?\"\n\"Well, we used an oil lamp. But we've no oil to burn.\"\n\"Maybe kerosene   would do,\" suggested Colin. \n\"Well, I suppose,\" Mr. Duffy thought. \"But you wouldn't find even a little spare kerosene in this village. Everyone is so poor ...\"\nColin was gone before Mr. Duffy could finish his sentence. \nHe ran back to the cottage. Then he ran out with four buckets. Colin could see candles glowing in nearly every cottage in the valley. A candle on Christmas Eve meant that a stranger would be welcome and given whatever he asked. He didn't stop running until he came to the first house. \n\"Could you spare me just a half cup of kerosene from your lamp?\" he asked. Colin went to every house where a candle was shining . In one hour he had filled two buckets. Slowly and painfully he carried them up to the lighthouse door. \n\"What's this?\" Mr. Duffy asked. \"This won't keep the lamp burning for more than an hour or so.\"\n\"I'll get more!\" Colin shouted as he started down the hill. \nAfter three more long hours, Colin had gathered five more buckets of kerosene. He was on his way with the sixth pail, when the tower suddenly shone with light. The light spread toward the dark heart of the sea like a finger pointing home. Mr. Duffy had lighted the lamp! \nIt was very late when Colin reached home. His mother jumped from her seat near the fire. \n\"Colin, where have you been? You've had no supper, nor lighted your candle!\"\n\"Oh, mom! I've lighted a candle, and it's a big one!\"\nColin slept soundly that night, dreaming of candles. Suddenly, a loud shout aroused him from his sleep. \n\"The boat! The boat was just different in the fog, lost.\" Colin rushed to the window. His mother was running toward the harbor. It was true! There floated his father's boat. Colin ran across the yard and raced to the harbor. He felt a wet wind on his face. It was beginning to snow. \nOh, it was Christmas morning all right, falling right from heaven and into his heart!", "id": "high17811.txt"}
