It has been reported that South Korea will apply to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO ) to make the celebration of the Dragon Boat Festival its own intangible cultural heritage  . If successful, people from other countries may see the Dragon Festival as a Korean creation.\nAs the birthplace of the yearly event more than 2,000 years ago, China is not happy with the situation. \"It would be a shame if another country successfully made a traditional Chinese festival part of its own cultural heritage ahead of China,\" said Zhou Heping, deputy  culture minister. The Ministry of Culture is even thinking of making its own application to UNESCO, covering all traditional Chinese festivals, including the Dragon Boat event.\nIt is thought that the festival is held in memory of the great poet Qu Yuan (340-278 BC), who lived in the State of Chu during the Warring States Period. Qu was known to be a patriot   and admired by ordinary people.\nHe is said to have jumped into Miluo River, because he had lost hope in his country's future. When people heard about Qu's death, they sailed up and down the river searching for his body. They also beat the drums to frighten away the fish and threw Zongzi into the water to stop the fish touching Qu. Dragon boat racing is said to come from this search for the poet's body.\nOver the years, the Dragon Boat Festival has spread throughout the world. In Japan and Viet Nam, as well as South Korea, the festival has mixed with and become part of the local culture.", "id": "high9033.txt"}
