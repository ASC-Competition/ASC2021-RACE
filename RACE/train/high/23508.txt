But how does the message get from the wounded leaf to the rest of the plant ?\n       Most scientists believed the alarm was spread by chemical messengers until a team of researchers headed by David Weldon-- a biologist at the University of East Anglia in Norwich , England -- made a shocking discovery .  An injured leaf , the researchers found , sends an electrical signal to warn neighboring leaves of upcoming danger . It's a \" terribly tiny current \" driven by an electrical potential difference of only 20 millvolts   , says Weldon , who measured the voltage after electrodes were attached to the plant's surface .  \n       \" Right now , all we can say is that there is a correlation , \" Weldon notes . \" If you wound the plant , you'll see an electrical signal accompanied by a biochemical response . \" To learn more about the reaction , Weldon's team plans to insert electrodes within the pant tissue ( rather than on the surface ) to determine what's going on at the cellular level . The findings may help explain other mysteries surrounding plants . For example , many plants start to flower in springtime , as days grow longer , but plants sense the change in the day length through their leaves , while flowers begin to bloom at the buds   .  \" There must be a signal from the leaf to the growing points , \" Weldon says . \" So far , no one has come up with a convincing chemical mechanism . Maybe an electrical signal is involved . \"", "id": "high23508.txt"}
