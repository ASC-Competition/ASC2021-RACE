The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests.\nUnder the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course.\nStudents graduating under the new medical or dental education system are given master's degrees, while those graduates who studied under the previous system have bachelor's degrees.", "id": "high3110.txt"}
