She buys or borrows a print book only when it's not available digitally. Miscioscio says most of her friends and relatives have also switched to e-books for the convenience and lower prices. Last winter, she notes, she vacationed in Costa Rica and says \"at least 75% of those reading were reading electronically. I was shocked to see people taking their e-readers onto the loungers   in the pool.\"\nMeier, 43, a marketing director in Beaver Falls, prefers her books on paper, not screens. After working on a computer all day, she says, \"I want a book in my hand. Turning over its pages is my way of knowing it's time to relax and slow down.\" Meier, who's sticking with physical books, doesn't consider herself any kind of digital \"resister.\" \"I'm comfortable with all forms of technology,\" she says. \"However, when it comes to books, I suppose I'm a traditionalist. My _ will always be the real thing.\"\nTo her, part of the joy of reading is the book itself: \"pulling it from the shelf, inspecting the cover, letting it fall open to a random page.\"\nBoth have lots of company. Statistics show that e-book sales grew 43% last year, but that's a slowdown compared with the triple-digit increases in recent years. E-books remain the fastest-growing part of the book market but account for only about 20% of all sales, reported by publishers.\nMiscioscio and Meier are at opposite ends of a book business in transition. Even though e-book sales have grown more than 4,000% since 2008, it's unlikely that physical books will disappear the way records did in the music industry.", "id": "high9009.txt"}
