Probably the most important is to share what you have learned with your family and friends.\n       Use the family car less. Walk or cycle whenever possible. Take a bus. Try ride sharing.\n       Use less energy in the house by turning down the heat when you are away or sleeping and turning off lights and electrical equipment you aren't using.\n       If your family needs a car,  make sure to buy a fuel-efficient one.   An average car sends out nearly 60 tons of carbon dioxide during its lifetime, compared to between 22 and 30 tons from a fuel-efficient car.\n       Encourage your family to use the car more efficiently  : for example, check the air in the tires. Underinflated tires can increase fuel use by 8%.  Turn the car off instead of letting it run when it is stopped.  Idling uses more gas and sets free carbon dioxide into the air,\n       Reuse, recycle and compost (... ) your waste. It takes much less energy to reuse or recycle a product than to make a new one.  Correctly composting your food and yard waste removes the methane   that they would cause at the landfill site. Buying less is al- ways the best.\n Plant trees. Trees take in carbon dioxide, reduce pollution, provide shade, and look great.", "id": "high23926.txt"}
