The touching documentary reminds some people of their mother, and makes some realize that every grain comes from hard and laborious work. Some people see patriotism  in the documentary, and some consider it a great cultural export.\nHow did this documentary achieve a great influence beyond its subject matter in such a short time?\n\"It is not empty propaganda  about China's splendid food culture. Instead, it shows the techniques used in making food and their production process as well as the lives of ordinary people, thus striking a chord  with the audience,\" an Internet user said. The success of the documentary should be owed to sincerity and reality. Nowadays, many works of art that have high investment, high technology, and magnificent scenes lack nothing but sincerity and reality.\nA Bite of China shows that a commercial documentary promoting patriotism can be full of touching details, that the emotions of ordinary Chinese people should be exhibited even in publicizing  China overseas, and that even a completely commercial program can achieve both artistic and commercial success.\n\"We made this documentary with our respect and love for food,\" said director Chen Xiaoqing. Being sincere is the most important thing for artists because they cannot move others unless they themselves are first moved, and cannot convince others unless they themselves are first convinced. Sincerity is the \"secret\" for making this documentary so popular, and every cultural creator should learn from its success.", "id": "high7963.txt"}
