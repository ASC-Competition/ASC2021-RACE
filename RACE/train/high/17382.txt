Her message was \" Would someone help me? I can't breathe. Help me! I can't feel my left side.\"\n   At first, Sean thought it was a bad joke and he told his mother Sharon Redden. But she asked, \" It's not just some game, is it?\nThe message was not a joke. \" Susan Hicks\" was actually 20-year-old Taija Laitinen, a student working late at night at a college library near Helsinki, Finland---almost 7,000 miles away from Sean's home in Texas. While searching the Internet, she began to feel terrible pain all through her body. The library was empty and the nearest phone was outside in the hallway. She couldn't move that far because any movement caused the pain to get worse. Then as the pain became worse, she began typing her message for help in the chat room.\n\"I don't think it's a joke, mom,\" Sean said. He typed, \" Where are you? The letters appeared, \"Finland.\" Sean and Sharon couldn't believe it. Not knowing what else to do, Sharon called the local police and explained the situation to officer Amy Schmidt. Schmidt told Sharon to try to get the sick girl's phone number and address.\nMeanwhile, the Texas police called the international telephone operator and asked to be connected to the proper agency  in Finland. The Texas police explained the situation and gave Susan's address to the Finnish operator. When Sean heard that, he typed, \"Help is on the way.\"\nIn the few minutes, the library door opened. Doctors and three policemen ran in. Taija turned once more to the computer, \" They are here. Thanks. Bye-bye.\"", "id": "high17382.txt"}
