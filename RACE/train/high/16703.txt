Like thousands of others, she is now living in a tent in the hard-hitting city of Mianyang.\nWe are now sleeping in a tent city.\nThe earthquake happened last Monday and our rooms in school were destroyed. There are four tent cities. Everybody is sleeping under tents. The tents are so wet and we feel so cold. Many students feel uncomfortable but we must live in the tent. Although there are many difficulties after the earthquake, we will do our best to solve them.\nYesterday it rained all day. Today the weather is better. There are no dining halls and supermarkets, so we must cook for ourselves. We have got some food and vegetables to eat.\nAfter the earthquake, many students and I together cleaned all the rubble from our classroom and our dorms. Many of the rooms were destroyed and there was a lot of rubble which we had to clear.\nSome students are helping at hospital. Many people are homeless and many are dead. We carried the injured to hospital. There were no buses so we walked to hospital. Many people tried their best to make sure people could live. With the injured, we first let them calm down and then we took them to hospital.\nToday, I think people have enough food and drinking water. I think things will be better now.", "id": "high16703.txt"}
