And if I have to give him a certain amount of money. What is to prevent me keeping all the money left and claiming that the robber had taken it?\" Just then a tall and strong man walked in, wearing a mask. \"This is a holdup!\" the man said. Roughly, taking a gun from his pocket and stepping over to George's cage. \"All right, hand it over!\" \n\"Yes, sir,\" said George. \"Would you like it in ten-or twenty-dollar bills?\"\n\"Just hand it over!\" said the robber. George took all the bills from the top section close to six thousand dollars. He passed them through the window. The robber snatched them, stuffed them into his pocket, and turned to leave. Then, while everyone was watching the robber, George calmly lifted off the top section of the cashbox and slipped bills from the bottom section into his pockets. The door swung and the robber was gone. George fell down and fainted. When he came to he smiled up at the worried faces looking down at him. \"I'm all right,\" he stated bravely.\n\"You might just as well go home, George.\" Mr. Bell, the chief accountant, said.\nAs soon as he was safely behind his bedroom door, George took the money from his pockets and counted it. Seven thousand dollars!\nThe next morning when George arrived at the bank, it was not open for business, but everyone was there, helping to check the bank's accounts. George was called into Mr. Burrows' office. The bank president seemed strangely cheerful. \"George,\" he said, \"I want you to meet Mr. Charles, who used to be president of our bank.\"\n\"Good morning, George,\" said the former president. \"I was extremely sorry to hear you fainted yesterday. Are you all right now?\"\n\"Yes, sir, just fine, thanks.\"\n\"I was sorry to give you a hard time yesterday, but with all the banks being robbed these days, I played my little game yesterday, just to keep everybody on his toes.\"\n \"I don't understand,\" said George. \"What game?\"\nThe old man laughed and quickly took out a mask. He placed it over his face and said, \"All right. Hand it over!\" Mr. Burrows laughed but George didn't.\n\"And the money?\" George asked in a faint voice.\n\"Don't worry,\" Mr. Charles said. \"I put it all back in your cashbox--- all six thousand. We're just finishing up the check-up now.\" Behind them, the door opened and Mr. Bell put his head into the room. \"Mr. Burrows,\" he said gravely, \"may I see you a moment?\"", "id": "high18982.txt"}
