Eighteen! In spite of the hopeless condition, two of the children had a dream. They both wanted to pursue their talent for art. After many long discussions, the two boys finally worked out an agreement. They would toss a coin. The loser would go down into the nearby mines and, with his earnings, support his brother who attended the academy. Then, when that brother who won the toss completed his studies, in four years, he would support the other brother at the academy.\n               They tossed a coin on a Sunday morning after church. Albrecht Durer won and went off to Nuremberg. Albert went down into the dangerous mines and, for the next four years, financed his brother, whose work at the academy was excellent. By the time he graduated, he had earned considerable fees for his works.\n      When the young artist returned to his village, the Durer family held a festive dinner to celebrate Albrecht's triumphant homecoming, where Albrecht drank a toast to his beloved brother for the years of sacrifice that had enabled him to fulfill his ambition. His closing words were, \"Now you can go to Nuremberg to look for your dream, and I will take care of you.\"\n    Tears streaming down his pale face, shaking his lowered head from side to side, Albert sobbed, \"No... no... no...no. It is too late for me. Look...look at what four years in the mines has done to my hands! I have been suffering from arthritis   so badly in my right hand that I cannot even hold a glass to return your toast, much less draw delicate lines with a pen or a brush... For me, it is too late.\"\n      To show thanks to Albert for all that he had sacrificed, Albrecht Durer painstakingly drew his brother's abused hands with palms together and thin fingers stretched skyward. He called his powerful drawing simply \"Hands\", but the entire world almost immediately opened their hearts to his great masterpiece and renamed it \"The Praying Hands\".\nThe next time you see a copy of that touching creation, take a second look. Let it be your reminder, if you still need one, that no one - no one - no one ever makes it alone!", "id": "high17437.txt"}
