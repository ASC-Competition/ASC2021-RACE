Yale, Princeton, Columbia and Dartmouth were opened soon after Harvard.\nIn the early years, these schools were much alike. Only young men went to college. All the students studied the same subjects, and everyone learned Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Little was known about science then, and one kind of school could teach everything that was known about the world. When the students graduated, most of them became ministers or teachers.\nIn 1782, Harvard started a medical school for young men who wanted to become doctors. Later, lawyers could receive their training in Harvard's law school. In 1825, besides Latin and Greek, Harvard began teaching modern languages, such as French and German. Soon it began teaching American history.\nAs knowledge increased, Harvard and other colleges began to teach many new subjects. Students were allowed to choose the subjects that interested them.\nToday, there are many different kinds of colleges and universities. Most of them are made up of smaller schools that deal with special fields of learning. There's so much to learn that one kind of school can't offer it all.", "id": "high1911.txt"}
