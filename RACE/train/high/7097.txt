Advertising agencies have raised the art of creating an image to a state of near perfection. But if the product or service doesn't live up to it, customers will be very dissatisfied. The recent scandal   about the Arthur Andersen accounting firm showed that behind that image, it had unfair business practices under the table. Despite the previous positive image, the firm is being accused of criminal actions. Although the image had been nearly perfect, the reality behind the image has led to its downfall.\nSimilarly, personal consultants  can build up a very positive public image for politicians and movie stars in the view of the general commons. But once again, history is filled with examples of both that fell from grace   like the story of the Hollywood actor giving in to the pressures of fame and fortune. With people, just as with products and services, image is certainly important, but without positive substance behind it, failure is close.\nTo conclude, it's clear that an appealing image is extremely important to success, whether that image is related to selling a product or service or to the \"selling\" of a person. But image is only half of the equation . What lies behind that image is every bit as important as the image itself -- the person or product must live up to that image or there's little chance for long-term success.", "id": "high7097.txt"}
