So they set up a different kind of classroom, which you might see in the future. \nInstead of desks, the Elton Hills Elementary students had adjustable work stations where they could stand, kneel on mats or sit on big exercise balls. Students were given laptops and iPods that allowed them to move and learn at the same time. \nSensors   were attached to the kids' legs to calculate how many calories students burned in their new set-up. \nTheir typical school day was probably not anything like yours. One group of students downloaded an audio file   of their teacher reading a book; they listened to it while walking for exercise. Another group took a spelling test by listening to their iPods. \nSome students liked the freedom, but others missed the traditional classroom. \n\"I don't like standing up,\" Mariah Matrious said. \"My legs get tired, and I like sitting down. \" \nSo, did the experiment work? Researchers still are studying the data, but early results indicate that the kids did move around more in the new classroom. \"It showed us that, given the opportunity to move, kids will move,\" said researcher Lorraine Lanningham-Foster. \nThat's important because studies have shown that even simple movement - climbing stairs instead of taking an elevator , for example, or washing dishes by hand instead of loading the dishwasher - can be as important as formal exercise when it comes to controlling one's weight.", "id": "high18983.txt"}
