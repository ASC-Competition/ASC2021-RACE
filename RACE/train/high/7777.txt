But the \"chalk and talk\" method helped them achieve better exam results. Modern classroom techniques may make school days a good deal happier, but contentment  is not the road to success in examinations, according to university researchers.\nTheir three-year study, monitoring the progress of 2000 teenagers, tried to measure the influence of the \"boredom factor\" in 17 selected schools in the north of England. The researchers also found that the old-fashioned approach  of teachers ordering pupils about is still alive and producing results. Their conclusions were welcomed yesterday by educationists who were worried by the shift to less formal lessons.\nThe pupils in the latest study were asked to award teachers marks to measure how frequently they followed or ignored today's fashion for \"child-centred\" education. A five-point scale was given to spot the teachers who always told them what they should know and what to write down. \"It was significant and not anything you would get by chance or accident. Certainly, when you compare the pupil's interest and attitude to school, there is a quite definite and highly significant difference,\" one of the researchers said. But the rankings were turned upside down when the team of four researchers looked at how the children did in examination. The sort of methods now frowned upon  actually improve the final grades.\nThe researchers said,\"There is nothing wrong with old-fashioned, didactic  teaching in the fight place, even if it isn't the flavor at the moment.\" However, he insisted the best teachers had always mixed the two techniques to match the needs of pupils, although certain examinations forced some to concentrate more on dictation and learning by rote .", "id": "high7777.txt"}
