They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight.\nBali was divided into seven small kingdoms. The land around each kingdom was kept empty, and no one lived there. Since the kingdoms did not share the same borders, the people could not fight about them.\nOn Bali, even the young were not allowed to fight. If two children started a fight over a toy, someone stopped them. When two boys argued, they would agree not to speak to each other. Sometimes they did not talk to each other for months. This gave the boys a chance to forget their anger.\nFamilies who were angry with each other also promised not speak to one another. Their promise was written down, and the whole village knew about it. If they broke their promise, they had to offer presents to their gods.", "id": "high19153.txt"}
