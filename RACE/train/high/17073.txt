If you had to ask one of them for help, whom would you pick?\n  Before you give your answer, you should probably know that a new study found that women are better than men at multitasking  , especially if one of those tasks is searching for a lost item. That should help you choose.\n  In the study, a team of UK researchers compared the performances of 120women and 120men in  a computer game involving tasks of counting and shape-recognition \nMen and women were equally capable when tasks were  handled one at a time. But when the tasks started switching quickly , men responded c) much slower than women.\nTo make the experiment more  relevant to everyday life, researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were asked to complete a series of \"everyday challenges\" such as finding restaurants on a map and searching for a lost key in a field.\nOnce again, women outperformed men on the test, particularly in the key-searching task. \"It suggests that- in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them,'' researcher Keith Law of the University of Hertfordshire, UK, told the BBC,[ln contrast,] men had a slight impulsiveness ;they jumped in too quickly\"\nBut where did women get the ability to keep organized under pressure? Researchers believe that it has its roots in evolution ,In early human communities, women had to keep an eye on children while cooking meals. Meanwhile, men only needed to focus on hunting.\nMen might not be happy about this study. After all, many great pilots are men and they have to deal with lots of information at the same time too.\nThis is true, and researchers have their response. \"[We don't mean]that all men can't multitask, or that only women can,\" said Laws.[We are saying that] the average woman is better able to organize her time and switch  between tasks than the average man. There's no point denying these differences exist.\"", "id": "high17073.txt"}
