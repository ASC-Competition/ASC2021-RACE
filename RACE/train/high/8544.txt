The word caught the attention of the dictionary's editing team after BBC's recent program on influential Chinese words.\n\"If its influence continues, it is very likely to appear on our updated list of words,\" said Julie Kleeman, project manager with the editing team. Kleeman told the Beijing Youth Daily that \"tuhao\" has some similarities with the English word \"bling\", which refers to expensive, ostentatious   clothing or jewelry. Both the two words have existed for long but later on took a new meaning.\nIn Chinese, \"tu\" means rude and \"hao\" means rich. It has traditionally been referred to rich people who throw their weight around in China's rural areas. In recent years, people in the ACG (anime, comic and game) circle borrowed the term to describe those who spend money in an unreasonable manner.\nThe word gained acceptance in September with the launch   of Apple's new gold-colored iPhone, an item loved by China's nouveau riche  . The color became known as \"tuhao gold\".The word is now often used by the online community to refer to people who have the cash but lack the class to go with it.\nKleeman also mentioned another Chinese word \"dama\" which may also be taken in the dictionary.\n\"Dama\", meaning middle-aged women, was first used in the Western media by the Wall Street Journal in May when thousands of Chinese women were buying up record number of gold. They were the driving force in the global gold market between April and June when the gold prices had dropped. \"People can have an intuitive  grasp of the meanings if they see pinyin\", Kleeman said adding that people avoided using an English word to keep the original meaning. The new words will be first uploaded on the official website before the dictionaries arrive. The online version is also renewed every three months.", "id": "high8544.txt"}
