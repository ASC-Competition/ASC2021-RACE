Tom looked at the fence, which was long and high, feeling all enthusiasm leaving him. He dipped his brush into the whitewash before moving it along the top board of the fence. He knew other boys would arrive soon with all minds of interesting plans for this day. As walking past him, they would tease him for having to work on a beautiful Saturday--which burnt him like fire.\nHe, putting his hands into his pockets and taking out all he owned with the expectation of letting someone paint, found nothing that could buy half an hour of freedom. At this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea occurred to him, pouring a great bright light into his mind. He took up his brush and continued to work pleasantly with calm and quietness.\nPresently, Ben Rogers came in sight--munching an apple and making joyful noises like the sound of a riverboat as he walked along. Tom went on whitewashing, paying no attention to the steamboat.  \"Hello!\" Ben said, \"I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\"\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush gently along the fence and surveyed the result. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for Ben's apple while he kept painting the fence.\nBen said, \"That's a lot of work, isn't it?\"\nTom turned suddenly saying \"Here you are! Ben! I didn't notice you.\"\n\"I'm going swimming,\" Ben said. \"Don't you wish you could go? Or would you rather work?\" Tom said, \"Work? What do you mean 'work'?\"\n\"Isn't that work?\" Tom continued painting and answered carelessly, \"Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is it suits Tom Sawyer.\"\n\"Do you mean that you enjoy it?\"\n\"I don't see why I oughtn't to enjoy it.\"\n\"Does a boy have a chance to paint a fence frequently\" said Tom.\nBen stopped munching his apple.\nTom moved his brush back and forth--stepped back to note the effect--added a little paint here and there. Ben watched every move, getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed. After a short time, he said, \"Tom, let me whitewash a little.\"\nTom seemed to be thinking for a moment before he said, \"No, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. If it was the back fence, maybe you could do it. But this fence beside the street is where everybody can see it. It has to be done right.\"\n\"Oh, come on, let me try. I'll be careful. Listen, Tom. I'll give you part of my apple if you let me paint.\" \"No, Ben, I'm afraid--\" \"I'll give you all the apple!\"\nTom handed the brush to Ben with unwillingness on his face but _ in his heart. While the riverboat worked and sweated in the hot sun, Tom, an artist sat in the shade close by, munching his apple, and planning how he could trick more of the boys.\nBefore long there were enough boys each of whom came along the street; stopped to laugh but soon begged to be allowed to paint. By the middle of the afternoon, Tom had got many treasures while the fence had had three layers of whitewash on it. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, he would have owned everything belonging to the boys in the village.\nTom said to himself that the world was not so depressing after all. He had discovered a great law of human action: in order to make a man cover a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.", "id": "high9492.txt"}
