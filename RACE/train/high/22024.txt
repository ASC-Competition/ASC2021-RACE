And they probably think it very original and smart.\nThe idea of this language is to prevent the authorities- parents and teachers- from understanding what is said.\nMs. Li, mother of a 15-year-old girl, logged  onto her daughter's online space and found lines of codes, mixed English, Japanese and half-finished Chinese characters, which looked completely meaningless to her. Her daughter told her that it was \"Martian language\" and her  _ all used it.\nThe new language is becoming very popular in online spaces- so much so that even some translating software has been created to translate the normal language into \"Martian language\".\nA 14-year-old netizen, nicknamed \"S. _ Tangguo\", explained that the language could be created by anyone. \"At first, I just copied the language form other people's articles. Later , I began to create some words by myself. I split  some Chinese characters, or use words that have similar pronunciations to interchange with each other, or even add some English, Japanese or Korean words into my article, and that makes the new language. My classmates all chat in 'Martian language'. It's in style and can help us hide our secrets from our parents or teachers.\"\nUnlike the worried parents, some experts have found positive aspects in the spread of this unusual online language. Wang Haiyong, a psychologist ,said that there's no need to be too worried about the phenomenon. This so-called \"Martian language\" is just a little hobby of the post-90s generation. On the other hand, the new language can inspire children's imaginations, which is a good thing. However, Wang also advised teachers and parents to give proper guidance to their children, helping them better distinguish between online language and the normative  language of real life.", "id": "high22024.txt"}
