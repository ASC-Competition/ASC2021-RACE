But now after a childhood spent crafting those notes, the music of gratitude flows naturally from me.\nI hire Brant to build an arbor   around my front door. I drew it exactly as I wanted, and he realized my vision perfectly. Surprised at how the arbor's beauty uplifted me every time I stepped into my house, I called Brant a few weeks after the arbor went up. He answered the phone defensively.\n\"What can I do for you?\" he asked, his voice cold and distant.\n\"You can say, 'You're welcome,' \" I responded.\n\"I don't understand,\" Brant shot back.\n\"I am calling to say 'Thank you.'
