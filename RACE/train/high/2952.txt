He got $10 for each A.\"\nI suddenly became concerned. These payoffs might get parents through grammar school, but what about high school and beyond? What would be left after the electric guitar, the cell-phone, and the DVD player?\nI saw the road ahead: _ I saw my comfortable lifestyle disappear before my eyes---no more of those $5 bags of already-peeled organic carrots. No more organic anything!\nI started to feel surprised and nervous. Would every goal achieved by my two children fetch a reward? A high grade point average? A good class ranking?

Maybe once in a while we went out for pizza, but that's about it.\"\nDon't you just hate that? We're all running around looking for the MP3 player with the most updates, and she's spending a few dollars on pizza. She gets motivation; we get negotiation. And what about the primary grades?
