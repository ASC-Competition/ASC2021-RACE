Women in business were unheard of.  No respectable woman would dream of entering what was strictly a \"man's world\". Even if she would, what could she do? Men were sure that no woman could do a job well outside her home.  This was a widely-accepted idea. When the famous Bronte sisters began writing books in 1846, they had to resort to using men's names as aliases.\nTeaching was the first profession opened to women, soon after 1800. But even that was not easy for women to take because most high schools and colleges were open only to men. Oberlin College in Ohio was the first college in America to take in women.\nNursing was regarded as a respectable profession for women only after Florence Nightingale won high credit for her nursing career and became famous.
