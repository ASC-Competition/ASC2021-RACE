As we were leaving, we found that only minutes earlier an elderly woman had fallen over at the entrance and had hit her head on the concrete. Her husband was with her, but there was blood everywhere and the woman was embarrassed and clearly in shock.\nWalking towards the scene, Tenyson became very upset about what had happened to the couple. He said to me, \"Mum, it's not much fun falling over in front of everyone.\"\nAt the front of the supermarket a charity  group had set up a stand selling cooked sausages and flowers to raise funds. Tenyson suggested that we should buy the lady a flower. \"It will make her feel better,\" he said. I was amazed that he'd come up with such a sweet idea. So we went over to the flower seller and asked her if we could buy a flower for the lady to cheer her up. \"Just take it,\" she replied. \"I can't take your money for such a wonderful gesture.\"\nBy now paramedics had arrived, and were attending the injured woman. As we walked up to her, my son became _ by all the blood and medical equipment. He said he was just too scared to go up to her. ZXXK\nInstead I gave the flower to the woman's husband and told him, \" My son was very upset for your wife and wanted to give her this flower to make her feel better.\"\nAt that, the old man started crying and said, \"Thank you so much, you have a wonderful son. Happy Mother's Day to you.\"\nThe man then bent down and gave his wife the flower, telling her who it was from. Though badly hurt and shaken, the old lady looked up at Tenyson with love in her eyes and gave him a little smile.", "id": "high6807.txt"}
