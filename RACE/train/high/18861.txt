The company has developed a tiny chip  that fits inside a football and determines whether the ball has crossed the goal line, by being able to discover its exact location on the field. The world football organization, FIFA, has shown interest in the technology. It is very possible that the new technology will be used in the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\n\"We've been testing the technology at the main soccer stadium in Nuremberg for some time and more recently in an under-17 FIFA Cup in Peru,\" said Gunter Rohmer, a director of the company. \"The technology has performed well, and we're pretty optimistic that it will be used at the games in Russia.\"\nThe chip only weighs 12 grams, and is placed in the center of the football. It sends 2,000 signals a second to a receiver network of 12 antennas ,placed around the field. The receivers then send information about the ball's location to a central computer, and because it works in real time, it can immediately tell the referee whether a goal has been scored. The chip even can tell when the ball crosses the line in mid-air. Oliver Braun, one of the inventors of the chip, says that feedback from German referees was generally positive. Germany sports-wear giant Adidas is also optimistic about using this kind of chip in other ball sports.\nFIFA aims to test the technology later this year at another game in Japan before deciding whether or not to introduce it in all 12 stadiums in Russia for next World Cup.", "id": "high18861.txt"}
