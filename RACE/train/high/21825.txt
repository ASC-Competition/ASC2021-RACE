In fact, your real education is just beginning.\nI'd like to pass on a few lessons that you didn't necessarily get in school. If you've been out of school for a few years or a lot of years, they could still teach you something.\n*Develop relationships and keep networking. If I had to name a single characteristic shared by all the truly successful people I've met, I'd say it is the ability to create and nurture   networks of contacts. Start strengthening your relationships now, so that they'll be in place when you really need them later. In \nthe classroom it was mostly about individual performance. Success in real life requires relationships.\n *Set goals. Ask any winner what the key to his or her success was, and you'll hear four consistent messages: vision, determination, persistence, and setting goals. If you don't set goals and determine where you're going, how will you know when you get there? Goals give you more than a reason to get up in the morning; they are an incentive  to keep you going all day.\n*Sense of humor. I'm a firm believer in using humor, though not necessarily jokes. A good sense of humor helps one understand the unconventional(  ), tolerate the unpleasant, and overcome the unexpected. There are plenty of times to be serious, but I believe that keeping things light and comfortable encourages better teamwork.\n*Volunteer. It might be hard to do a lot of volunteer work at first, but people who help others on a regular basis have a healthier outlook on life.", "id": "high21825.txt"}
