Not someone you \nknew, but a total stranger? It's happened to me a few times, but two instances really stand out.\nA few years ago, I was dining out with a person who kept going on and on about himself, \ncompletely oblivious to the fact that I was sitting there in misery.It wasn't his company that disappointed me.I was recovering from a broken heart, and just sitting down to dinner reminded me of my last relationship.I could have collapsed in tears right there at the table.\nWhen we picked up the check, the waitress said, \"Your meal was already paid for.\" My friend \nand I didn't have a clue how it happened.Then I remembered a man coming in out of the corner of my eye.He was dressed in mostly white, sat down at the bar, had a glass of wine, stayed for maybe ten minutes, and then left.The waitress said, \"Yes, the gentleman who was in here a while ago paid for you.\" \nJust last year, I was running a half-marathon.With just 0.1 miles to go, I was out of gas.\nRunners call it \"hitting the wall\"; I thought I couldn't move another muscle.Out of nowhere, a teenager jogs up next to me and says, \"What's your name, sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!\" And he ran with me until I picked up my pace.I found him at the finish line to thank him for the encouragement only to learn he wasn't even supposed to be in the race that day.He was running in place of someone else.\nI still shake my head when I think of these momentary angels that came to me at my point of \nneed.Do you have any experiences like this?", "id": "high21287.txt"}
