Their findings are published in Sleep and Biological Rhythms.\nNearly half of the respondents associated their problem with electronic media use before bedtime. Longer electronic media users were also more likely to report insufficient sleep.\n\"Overall, 29% of light users (less than 1.5 hours) listed electronic media use as a possible cause of their insufficient sleep. By comparison, 40% of medium users (1.5 to 3 hours) and 54% of heavy users (more than 3 hours) said the same.\nHowever, longer Internet and television use before bedtime did not _ less actual sleep.\nWhile heavy users averaged about 3 more hours in front of computer or television screens than light users, the heavy users averaged only about 12 minutes less pre-workday sleep time than light users.\nNotably, Suganuma said, \"Internet use affected self-perceived insufficient sleep more than TV watching not only in younger Internet users but also in middle-aged or aged Internet users.\"\nUp to 38% of the respondents listed accessing the Internet far into the night as a possible cause for their sleep disturbance, while about 25% said watching television far into the night caused it.\nThe findings suggest that while heavy computer and television use before bedtime has a small effect on sleep duration, it may have a more significant effect on \"sleep demand and sleep quality,\" Suganuma notes.", "id": "high5421.txt"}
