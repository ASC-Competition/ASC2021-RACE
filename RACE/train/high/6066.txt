I felt restless and very upset. The next morning, while waiting at the bus stop, I hoped to run into him again.But he wasn't there.I thought he may have gone to the sidewalk to sleep for the night.I looked around for him, but he had disappeared.Disappointed, I decided to check for him again on my way back.\nWhile returning from work that day, I came back to the bus stop and resumed my search for him. Thankfully, he was there.I quickly went to a nearby store and got him a blanket, some bread, and biscuits. When I handed them to him, he seemed very grateful.\"Now I will be safe from the cold,\" he smiled. I also gave him some more money and told him to keep it safely.After being able to help him, I felt very at peace.", "id": "high6066.txt"}
