He will leave the earth in the  launching window of June 2052 and set his foot on the surface of Mars in November, together with the other 6 astronauts assigned for the mission to further explore the planet.\nPatrick has now two years of training ahead of him to get ready for the trip. Not only will he spend five months in getting to Mars, but another 600 days there before he can go back home.  Patrick was of course very excited, \" This has been my dream since I was four, and seeing the first man on Mars 20 years ago made me realize that it was possible.\"\nTo be able to pay the $ 1. 3 billion for his ticket for the trip Patrick sold his majority stake   in the company his father had built. \"I know that my father would have been proud of me if he had still been alive today, he knew what this means to me\", says Patrick. _ but it is said that he was paid twice as much for his part of the company.\nSo, how is he going to spend his 600 days on the red planet? \"Well, since I don't have a job when I get back after selling the company, I have plenty of time to come up with a new business idea\", he says and laughs. If he brings a shovel he can start building the first hotel there, but maybe he shouldn't expect too many guests until someone can offer a cheaper ticket.", "id": "high3392.txt"}
