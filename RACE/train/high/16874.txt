Stress can come from work. It can come from family. It can come from the places we live and the lifestyles we choose.\nIn a recent survey, 60 percent of respondents said the city in which they live is noisier now than five years ago. The other 40 percent? They didn't hear the question.\nHow much stress do you feel? Though not all stress should be avoided, too much pressure can cause lasting harm in practically every area of your life. The solution is to take control.\nRobert Reich did just that. As Secretary of Labor in the Clinton cabinet ,Robert B. Reich, told of his decision to resign from the stressful job. He said,\"I have the best job I've ever had and probably ever will. No topping it.\"It was true. He seemed to love his job. But he added, \"I also have the best family I'll ever have, and I can't get enough of them.\"And there was the problem --too much of a good thing. He could not give himself to his family and to this particular career at the same time.\nSo Reich said,\"I had to choose, I told the boss I'll be leaving, and explained why.\" His boss, of course, was the president of the United States. And the country took notice. Some people were surprised. Here was a high government official who made a decision to step out of an important and powerful position in order to spend more time at home. He took control.\nThat is the first step to free ourselves from unnecessary stress: take control. Make the hard decision. It may be a decision for less money, a smaller home, a new location, a different job, less prestige ,or a simpler lifestyle. But one thing I believe: it will be a decision you will never regret.", "id": "high16874.txt"}
