When their living place dries up, they live on the land in logs , said Scott Taylor, a researcher at the Brevard Endangered Lands Program in Florida .\nThe fish, whose scientific name is Rivulus marmoratus, can grow as large as three inches. They group together in logs and breathe air through their skin until they can find water again.\nThe new scientific discovery came after a trip to Belize.\n\"We kicked over a log and the fish just came crowding out,\" Taylor told Reuters in neighboring Guatemala by telephone. He said he will make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year.\nIn lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating.\nSome other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in an inactive state. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and remain active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at Canada's University of Guelph.\nFurther studies of the fish may tell how animals changed over time.\n\"These animals live in conditions similar to those that existed millions of years ago, when animals began making the transition form water onto land, \" Wright said.", "id": "high8084.txt"}
