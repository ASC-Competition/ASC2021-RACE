I happened to be at a local Walmart picking up some stuff for my wife when I laid my eyes on two young ladies. They were walking confidently, with their heads held high, which made me believe that they were involved in some kind of competitive sport. They were wearingT-shirts, at the back of which printed, \"Pain is temporary, but pride is forever.\" Thinking of these words, I automatically said to myself, \"That's right! No pain, no gain.\"\nWhatever is worth having is worth fighting for, and with fight, there comes pain! Fortunately, pain is just temporary. However, it is a necessary step you need to take to get your gain.\nAthletes and their coaches understand this so well. They spend so many hours and so much effort preparing for a competition. Some will think about giving up when the training is so painful, but coaches are there to remind them that \"quitters never win and winners never quit\".. So they know that when victory comes, they will be proud of themselves and that pride can last a lifetime.\nYou've probably heard the saying, \"There's no such thing as a free lunch.\" Well, it is true. Everything in life has a price, whether you agree or not. To want something for free will always lead to deception. Even if you get it, you will not value it or enjoy it, because it is free.\nNo one has told you that life is easy! In fact it is a series of struggles and fights. You will achieve what other people call \"impossible\" only when you are willing to endure pain and overcome fear and doubt. Your achievement in life is in direct proportion to how much sacrifice you are willing to make.\nSuccessful people are usually and wrongly labeled as lucky or highly favored by circumstances. However, if you hear their personal stories, you will realize that they went through a lot of trials, but still kept on going, enduring the pain to make where they are today. If we understand that every effect has its cause, then we will grasp the fact that we do have a chance to influence the outcome we get in life.", "id": "high18322.txt"}
