And yet in a recent survey, 95% of them said they were either very happy or quite happy.\nThey give their city high marks for cleanliness and safety--subways are pristine   and unfailingly arrive on time, and police are seen as helpful and good at their jobs. What's more, they feel they can count on their neighbours--all 5.1 million of them.\nArhus, Denmark\nThe residents of Arhus cheerfully part with 68% of their income in taxes, knowing that in return they will be guaranteed free healthcare, free daycare, and a top-notch   education for their children.\nAn energetic city of 300,000 with a lively cultural scene and a diverse number of religions represented, _ (the range in incomes is narrow), as well as easy access to the nearby sea and surrounding countryside, make Arhus seem more like a small town.\nSan Luis Obispo, CA\nAccording to a 2008 Gallup-Healthways study, people who live in San Luis Obispo are more likely than residents of other U.S. cities to smile and experience joy and are less likely to experience pain or depression. About 64,000 of the 260,000 people in the greater metropolitan area  , located halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, volunteer at over 11,000 non-profit organizations.\nFew journeys to work are longer than 10 minutes (one reason its members rank in the upper third for job satisfaction), so \"it's easy to be involved,\" resident Pierre Rademaker said. Business signs are unobtrusive   by law, fewer than 11% of residents smoke--the lower rate in the U.S.--there are lots of bike lanes, and the city's plaza draws crowds of people for free concerts on summer Fridays. What's not to love?\nMonterrey, Mexico\nThe people of Monterrey don't enjoy high household incomes or access to good healthcare. Instead, there's a profound sense of gratitude for the new political freedom enjoyed since the oppressive Institutional Revolutionary Party lost power in 2000--the first time in nearly a century--as well as an emphasis on social life over work.\nAnother reason Monterrey residents may be so happy is their faith in God and family, and their ability to tough it out through bad times.\n\"We laugh at sickness, poverty and even death,\" says Basanez, a political scientist who lives in Monterrey. \"We even have a holiday to celebrate death. November 2, the Day of the Dead, is one of the biggest holidays of the year.\"", "id": "high5427.txt"}
