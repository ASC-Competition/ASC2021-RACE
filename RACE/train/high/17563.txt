'\n    Scientists are now finding shared relations between models of solar weather interactions and the actual climate over many thousands of years,including the last ice Age.The problem is that the models are predicting that the world should be entering a new Ice Age and it is not.One way of solving this theoretical difficulty is to assume a delay of thousands of years while the solar effects overcome the inertia of the earth's climate.If this is right, the warming effect of carbon dioxide might thus be serving as a useful opposed balance to the sun's fading heat.", "id": "high17563.txt"}
