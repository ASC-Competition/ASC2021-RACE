This part of Brooklyn, in New York City, has a lot of crime. More than half of its 100,000 residents rely on aid from the government. Only 50% of students at Bushwick High School graduate in four years.\nSome people might say, \"We should help these poor kids who have so many challenges.\" But Malaak Compton-Rock looks at the teens in Bushwick and says, \" Go to help kids who have even bigger challenges than you do.\" She believes that once young people see the power they have to make things better, they can handle their own problems more easily. So her service group, the Angel Rock Project, took 30 Bushwick kids to Soweto, in South Africa, to help poor families there. Soweto is a township outside the city of Johannesburg. The effort, called Journey for Change, aims to show that any kid can change the world.\n\"Kids in Bushwick face pressure to drop out of school or become involved in gangs and drugs.\" Says Compton-Rock. \"We want them to live a life of purpose and service.\"\nIn Soweto, many parents have died of AIDS, a deadly disease. When that happens, a grandparent or a child must lead the family. The Bushwick volunteers helped such families. They tended vegetable gardens, cared for babies and bought groceries.\n\"The saddest thing was when we visited an orphanage   and I helped a little boy who had been abandoned because he had HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,\" says Queen Clyde, 12. \"It's been good to be on this trip. But what's also important is what we do when it's finished. That's what counts.\" \" I never appreciated what I had until I saw some people who had nothing,\" says Sadara Lewis, 12 \"It's really changed my attitude. I want to make a difference.\"\nThe trip was two weeks long. But the kids, aged 12 to 15, will spend all year speaking about their experience, fund-raising and more.", "id": "high2665.txt"}
