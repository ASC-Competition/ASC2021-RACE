Many people paid tribute to the former astronaut. But other people feel regret that no human has been back to the moon since 1972, just three years after Armstrong landed on it and gave his famous \"giant leap for mankind\" speech.\nElliot Pulham, Chief Executive of the Space Foundation, thinks that America's space agency NASA should get more money, like in the 1960s, during the moon landings programme, when astronauts went to the moon. \"In this age of limited goals and tiny NASA budgets, Armstrong is a reminder of what our nation was once capable of,\" he said. \nArmstrong died because of heart problems after surgery. His recovery seemed to be going well, and his death was a surprise to many people. His family described him as a \"reluctant American hero\" and said: \"Honour his example of service, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink.\"\nSpeaking from the White House, Barack Obama said Armstrong was \"among the greatest of \nAmerican heroes - not just of his time, but of all time\". He added: \"And when Neil stepped on the \nmoon for the first time, it was a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten.\"\nBuzz Aldrin flew with Armstrong on Apollo 11. He was the second man to walk on the moon. He said he was very sad at the death of his good friend and companion.\n\"When I look at the moon I remember that special moment, over forty years ago, when Neil and I stood on the moon,\" he said. \"Looking back at our brilliant blue planet Earth hanging in the darkness of space, I realized that even though we were farther away from Earth than two humans \nhad ever been, we were not alone. Almost the entire world took that memorable journey with us. I know many millions of people around the world will join me in mourning the death of a true \nAmerican hero and the best pilot I ever knew. My friend Neil took the small step but giant leap that changed the world and will always be remembered as a historic moment in human history.\"\nIn the US, people felt that he represented the achievement of a past age of American greatness. Today, things are very different: NASA has cancelled a number of missions because they don't have enough money.\nFormer astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last man on the moon, said: \"Neil did something that people thought was impossible.\" Others complained about the state of the US. Journalist Andrew Pasternak wrote: \"It will take longer to rebuild lower Manhattan after 9/11 than it took to build an entire space program and send a man to the moon.\"\nOf course, NASA has its modern successes. Its engineers have landed a nuclear-powered robot on Mars. There will also be another Mars mission. It will drill below the planet's surface. But these achievements are not as exciting as Armstrong's. NASA administrator Charles Bolden expressed that in his tribute. \"As we enter this next era of space exploration, we are standing on the shoulders of Neil Armstrong,\" he said. \nArmstrong was disappointed by what NASA has become. Blogger Eric Berger saw an email from Armstrong and other former astronauts. It expressed frustration at the current problems at NASA and quoted Yogi Berra, an American baseball legend: \"If you don't know where you are \ngoing, you might not get there.\"", "id": "high23469.txt"}
