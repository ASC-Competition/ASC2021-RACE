Your cat is able to smell, whether you know it or not, whenever you come home or enter a new space. They can tell who you are, where you were an hour ago and sometimes even what you had for breakfast! Some people believe that cats can smell illnesses not only in themselves and other cats, but in humans as well. \nCats also have an extra sense organ that is unique to cat's family. The \"Jacobsen's organ\" as it is known, can be described as somewhere between smell and taste. It separates tastes particles   from the air, allowing the cat to \"taste\" whatever it can smell. Therefore, you may sometimes have seen a cat with its mouth slightly open and perhaps its tongue just a bit out when it is smelling smells. Whenever my cats do this, they seem to have a look of deep concentration on their faces.\nA cat's smell is so good that it can recognize each ingredient   in foods. Very few smells are dislikable to cats, so mothballs   have always been used to keep cats off gardens, since cats cannot stand the smell of them. \nSmells are also very important to your cat. They can recognize boundaries (,), people, other animals, food, and their environment. Your cat will walk around, checking for new things and will smell the slightest change. A cat can tell not only who you are, but also your general health and attitude, all from smells.", "id": "high21232.txt"}
