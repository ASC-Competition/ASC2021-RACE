Of that number, about one third children suffer head injuries and an estimated 200 die. By wearing a helmet, a child can reduce her risk of injury by as much as 85 percent. But remember ---- a bicycle helmet must fit properly to be safe. Here are five steps to making sure your child's helmet fits properly.\n1) If you haven't bought your child's helmet already, you might want to consider one with a rear stabilizer . A rear stabilizer holds the back of the head gently and helps the helmet stay correctly positioned.\n2) The helmet should fit closely and shouldn't slide from side to side or front to back. If your child can put two fingers on both temples inside the helmet, it's too big. Try a smaller size. But if the next size down is too small, use the fit pads . Fit pads come in different sizes and attach to the helmet with Velcro.\n3) Tell your child to open her mouth widely and ask if she can feel the helmet push down onto the top of her head. If she can't, you need to readjust her helmet.\n4) To prevent strap slippage, wind a rubber band around the strap where it meets the fastener.\n5) Recheck the fit regularly.\nYou should replace the bicycle helmet:\nIf she has been in an accident with it.\nIf the buckle  breaks or if a piece breaks off.\nIf it doesn't have a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, American Society for Testing and Materials, or Snell Memorial Foundation sticker.\nIf it doesn't fit correctly. Even if the helmet fit perfectly two years ago, it might be too small now.", "id": "high5209.txt"}
