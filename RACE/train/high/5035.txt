Or you've got tickets booked for a Caribbean cruise  , but your passport disappeared. Or maybe you've just come back from a grocery store tour and realized...Hey, did I leave my baby in the checkout line?\nOk, you've probably never gone to the extremes of our last example (we hope), but most of us experience slip - ups like these on a daily basis. No matter how smart you may be, it doesn't mean your brain won't turn to Swiss cheese every so often, and no amount of e-mail reminders can help you remember where you left your TV remote or lucky penny.\nBut now, there is a new pair of eyeglasses that can help to find all those little things you know must be around somewhere :  Let's call it Vision 2.0.\nThe new glasses, which are being developed in a Japanese lab under the code name Smart Goggles,are similar to a Google search engine for your eyes. The high - tech glasses come with a camera that records everything you see on a daily basis, and boast built - in object recognition software that allows them to keep track of whatever comes across their field of vision. If you've got a collection of art sculptures that the camera can't recognize immediately, no problem :  Just say the name of each item,  and the glasses will memorize them right away.\nThe Smart Goggles' superb tracking abilities mean that whenever you're looking for your keys, your overdue library book, or yes, even your baby, all you have to do is to say the word and the Goggles' camera will show you the last time your desired object appeared on screen, telling exactly where you'll be able to find it.\nThough the glasses are still too big for general use, the research team in Japan believes that they'll be able to make the modem glasses smaller to the size of normal glasses in the near future, making them the perfect new accessory for yourself or any other absent - minded Professor you know.\nWith these intelligent designs, you'll never lose anything again. Except maybe your glasses.", "id": "high5035.txt"}
