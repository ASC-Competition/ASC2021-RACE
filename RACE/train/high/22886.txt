Images of the capsule landing in Inner Mongolia at 10:05 local time were shown live on television. \n   The astronauts, including China's first woman in space, carried out a successful manual docking  with the Tiangong-1 laboratory module. This is a key step towards China's goal of building a space station by 2020. Premier Wen Jiabao praised it as a \"complete success\". \"This is another outstanding contribution by the Chinese people to humanity's efforts to explore and use space,\" Mr Wen said in Beijing.\n\"It feels so good to stand on Earth, and it feels even better to be home,\" astronaut Liu Wang was quoted by national broadcaster CCTV as saying. \"Tiangong-1, our home in space, was comfortable and pleasant. We're very proud of our nation, \" female astronaut Liu Yang said.\nThe crew of the Shenzhou-9 craft successfully carried out the country's manual docking operation earlier in the week. The delicate procedure, which involved bringing together two orbiting objects travelling at thousands of miles an hour, was mastered by USSR and US space teams in the 1960s. The crew also carried out automatic docking of the two crafts in the process.\nThe three astronauts returned to the Shenzhou-9 spacecraft on Thursday and performed a manual separation from the space laboratory. They touched down in Inner Mongolia's Siziwang county on Friday, with the capsule equipped with a parachute to slow its approach.\nMs Liu, 33, is a major in China's air force from the central province of Henan. On China's Tencent QQ messaging service, she goes by the name \"little Flying knight\". She was selected into China's space programme only two years ago, but she did particularly well, the official news agency Xinhua says. The Shenzhou-9 spacecraft was launched on 16 June.", "id": "high22886.txt"}
