There I found another surprise waiting for me . My room at the hotel had been given to somebody else and they had no room for me. Harkin had known my travel plans and had planned everything . How could he have booked the room only for three days ? There was nothing to be done but to find another hotel. The waiters were happy to find me a new hotel , and when I said that I was happy to stay at the airport , thinking it might be cheaper than staying in the city , they suggested the Holiday Inn at the airport . There was one small matter : the room rate was $ 300 per night . The best hotel in Katoomba had wanted only $ 145 . I asked if there was anything cheaper they might suggest but they warned that most hotels would already be full by this time.\nThe hotel was far from the train station , so I had to take a taxi , at $ 25 . On the way to the Holiday Inn , we passed a hotel just two blocks from the Holiday Inn that advertised a room rate of $ 104 . At the desk I asked if their room rate could go down a lot . \" No , this is a 4-star hotel,\" the waiter told me . \" In that case ,\" I replied , \" I'll just walk the two blocks to the cheap hotel.\" But she warned me that they were probably full and that if I didn't take the room , it might not be available when I came back . Finally , I decided to take the room.\nThe room itself was big , but the air conditioning couldn't keep up with the Australian heat . I couldn't sleep until about 1:00 am.", "id": "high7175.txt"}
