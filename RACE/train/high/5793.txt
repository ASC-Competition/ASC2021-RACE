Inside the cortex of the brain are billions of tiny nerve cells,called neurons. The nerve cells have branches connecting them to other cells in a complicated network. Communication between these brain cells is what allows us to think and solve problems. When you learn new things,these tiny connections in the brain actually multiply and get stronger.The more you challenge your mind to learn,the more your brain cells grow.Then,things that you once found very hard or even impossible to do--like speaking a foreign language or doing algebra --seem to become easy after learning them for a period of time.The result is a stronger,smarter brain.\nScientists started thinking that the human brain could develop and change when they studied animals'brains.They found out that animals that lived in a challenging environment were more _ --they were better at solving problems and learning new things.", "id": "high5793.txt"}
