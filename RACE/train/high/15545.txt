Psychologists at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand are studying the \"shop-till-you-drop\" habit as a behavioral disorder similar to compulsive eating. Compulsive shoppers frequently buy more than they can afford or more than they need, and it causes them distress .\n\"It becomes a problem when you are out of control,\" psychology lecturer Neville Blampied said. \"When you are feeling bad and blue, what do you do? Some people eat chocolate cake and ice cream. Some people take the credit card and go out to the shop.\" Bank managers understand the problem because they have to deal with people who have to be persuaded to stop using their cards drawing money.\nCompulsive shopping was first discovered in 1915, although it was then known as monomania. Few studies have been done on the problem.\nAn advertisement in a Christchurch paper, calling for people to take part in an experimental treatment program designed by Mr. Wilson, attracted 10 replies. But the problem, said Mr. Wilson, is \"clearly not rare\". He thinks that compulsive shopping should be treated with drugs. \"As psychologists we are interested in non-drug treatments for behavioral difficulties,\" Mr. Wilson said.\nCompulsive eaters or shoppers get a kick from their habit. \"Both activities provide an immediate kind of kick and you feel a bit better,\" he said. \"You have long-term problems, but human beings are extremely good at not seeing long-term problems and are very sensitive to short-term benefits,\" he said.\nThe aim of the treatment was to help people find better ways of managing their emotions. The program, consisting of 10 one-hour weekly lessons and two follow-up treatments, is loosely based on teaching stress management.\n\"You often have to start to get people to correctly recognize their emotions. Not being able to know what you really feel weakens your ability to solve the problems connected with what's making you feel that way,\" Mr. Wilson said.", "id": "high15545.txt"}
