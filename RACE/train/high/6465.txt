She led a survey of 2,326 parents who have children 8 and younger.It found that in 80 percent of families, children's media use was not a problem, with 55 percent \"not too\" or\" not at all\"  concerned about it. It also showed parents have more positive than negative feelings about how media consumption affects a child's learning and the development of creativity.The exception is video games, which are viewed more negatively than TV, computers or mobile devices.\"Parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children's school performance, attention time, creativity, social skills, behavior and sleep than any other medium,\" the researchers said in a news conference about the survey.\n The findings exposes a generational shift   in parental attitudes about technology's role in young children's lives,\" said Wartella.\"Today's parents grew up with technology as a central pact of their lives, so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents, instead of a battle with kids on one side and parents on the other, the use of media and technology has become a family affair. \"\nThe researchers identified three media environments created by parents: media-centric (39 percent of families) , media-moderate (45%)and media-light (16%). Children  in media-centric families spend at least three hours more each day watching TV or using computers, video games and tablet PCs don't make parenting easier.And 88 percent of parents say they are most likely to turn to toys or activities to keep their children occupied.Slightly fewer turn to books (79%) and TV(78%).\nThe survey didn't look at how media affects children. That's a topic that the American Academy of Pediatrics has handled a number of times. The AAP says studies have found too much media use can lead to attention- problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders and being fat. In addition, the Internet and cell phones can provide platforms for illegal and risky behaviors. By limiting screen time and offering educational media and non-electronic formats  such as books, newspapers and board games, and watching television with their children, parents can help guide their children's media experience. Putting questionable content into context and teaching kids a700ut advertising contributes to their media literacy   ,\" it says.\nThe pediatricians' group says parents should have \"screen-free zones\"  and TV should be turned off during dinner. At most, it recommends children and teens engage with entertainment media for no more than two hours a day and that should be high-quality content. It is important for kids to spend time on outdoor play, reading, hobbies  and  using their imaginations  in free  play.\" Kids  under 2 should not use television and other entertainment media because their brains are developing quickly and they learn best from direct human interaction,\" the group says.\nAn article on screen time by t.he Mayo Clinic also notes problems linked t.o over screen time, including  being  fat, irregular  sleep , behavioral  problems , weak  school  performance , violence  and  less time for active and creative play.", "id": "high6465.txt"}
