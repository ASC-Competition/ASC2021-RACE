But on Thursday, Viesturs became the only American to climb to the top of the world's 14 highest mountains.\nHis last hike was up Mount Annapurna, in Asia's snowcapped Himalayas. At 26,545 feet, its peak is the 10th highest in the world. It is the mountain that inspired him to start climbing.\n\"It tends to be the trickiest, the most dangerous,\" said Viesturs. \"There's no simple way to climb it. There are threatening avalanches   and ice falls that protect the mountain.\"\nIn high school, Viesturs read French climber Maurice Herzog's tale of climbing the icy Annapurna. Herzog's story was of frostbite   and difficulty and near-death experiences. Viesturs was\nright away.\nViesturs got his start on Washington's Mount Rainier in 1977, guiding hikes in the summer. Fifteen years ago, he set out to walk up to the world's highest peaks. Finally, he's done.\nThe pioneering climber talks about mountains as if they were living creatures that should be treated with respect. \"You have to use all of your senses, all of your abilities to see if the mountain will let you climb it,\" said Viesturs. \"If we have the patience and the respect, and if we're here at the right time, under the right circumstances, they allow us to go up, and allow us to come down.\"\nWhat's next for a man who can't stop climbing? \"I'm going to hug my wife and kids and kind of kick back and enjoy the summer,\" says Viesturs. But for a man who's climbed the world's 14 tallest mountains, he will probably soon set off on yet another adventure.", "id": "high15957.txt"}
