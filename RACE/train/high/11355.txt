Some watch TV or go to the movies; others take part in sports. It depends on _ interests. There are many different ways to spend our spare time.\nAlmost everyone has some kinds of hobbies. It may be anything from collecting stamps to making model airplanes. Some hobbies are very expensive, but others don't cost anything at all. Some collections are worth a lot of money; others are valuable only to their owners.\nI know a man who has a coin collection worth several thousand dollars.
