But also it s romantic and like a fairy tale.\"\nShe then successfully convinced her husband to be to have their wedding photos taken underwater a couple of months after her first try. \"Can you imagine a 1.87-meter-tall man trying out something like a fishtail under the water?\" Zhang says, laughing.\nA commercial underwater photo portrait is perfect for post 80 and post 90 generations who adore taking snapshots, but are looking for new ways to be artistic, says Ai Cheng, owner and photographer of No.55 Underwater Photography in Shanghai.\nAi opened a studio in Shanghai's suburb of Songjiang two years ago, building a 5-meter- deep, fan-shaped pool equipped with heating facilities to start up the business. A 30-minute training on how to smile under the water so that you won't drink too much water and how to open your eyes underwater is offered in his studio for those who don't know how to swim.\nAi says most of his customers are female--half of them coming for an artistic portrait photo and the rest for wedding pictures. \"Some of them drag their boyfriends or husband-to-be, who are unwilling to go down to the water, to shoot as well,\" he says.", "id": "high6102.txt"}
