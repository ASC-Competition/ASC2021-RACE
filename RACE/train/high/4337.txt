Mr.Frankel and Mr.Fox, both 17, are the authors of Breaking the Code, a new book that seeks to bridge the generational divide between parents and adolescents.It is being promoted by its publisher as the first self-help guide by teenagers for their parents, a kind of \"Kids Are From Mars, Parents Are From Venus\" that explains the language and actions of teenagers.The girls dealt with issues including hanging out late, money, school pressures, smoking etc.\nPersonally, I welcome their opinions.The most common missteps in interacting with teenagers arise from the war between parents exercising their rights to know what goes on under their roof and teenagers firmly guarding their privacy.Teenagers can be quick to interpret their parents' remarks and respond with anger that masks their vulnerability  . Ms Fox said, \"What we want above all is your approval.Don't forget, no matter how much we act as if we don't care what you say, we believe the things you say about us.\"\nNancy, a New York child-raising expert said she didn't agree with everything the authors suggested but found their arguments reasonable.\"When your kids are saying, ' _ ' there are lots of ways to respond so that they will listen and that is what the writers point out.\"\n\" My parents helped me see that, \" Mr.Fox told me, \" even though they used to stay out late and ride their bicycles to school, times have changed and the way parents educate children is different.These days there is a major fear factor in bringing up kids.Parents worry about their child crossing the street.\" The writers said they hoped simply to throw light on teenage thinking.", "id": "high4337.txt"}
