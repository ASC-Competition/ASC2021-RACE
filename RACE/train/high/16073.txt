Some see green plants, some see blooming flowers, or just seeds. But one group of Shanghai students saw an opportunity to make money.\nEight students from No 2 Secondary School Attached to East China Normal University started a virtual company selling different seeds and seed products. They successfully sold 28 pictures pasted with different seeds at a campus auction a week ago. The company, which has recruited around 20 student staff members, has earned over 2000 yuan in the past three months.\n\"We donated part of the money to a poor school in the countryside of Anhui Province. It's great to realize our ideal of 'spreading love and culture with seeds' after many tests and lots of hard work,\" said Senior 2 Shi Chen, CEO of the company.\nJust like any other company, Shi's didn't develop smoothly. Shi and her young colleagues used to sell fresh flowers and old books, and later found seeds might be something that their company could engage in. They bought seeds of various plants and flowers at low prices from a local farm and sold them in schools or on streets. The creative students also made accessories and pictures with different seeds.\nWith little business knowledge, the students had to learn new skills as the leaders of different departments, such as public relations (PR), sales and marketing. They persuaded a joint Sino-French company near their school to give them training in business management.\n\"They helped us overcome our shyness. We also learned quite a lot of business theory. I found communication skills and teamwork are very important for my job\" said Senior 1 Qian Yifei.\nThe 16-year-old was elected as PR manager thanks to her talent for speaking. She is also in charge of after sales service, dealing with complaints and providing suggestions.\nAs the head of the company, CEO Shi has a lot more to think about. First of all, she has to learn how to make her colleagues work efficiently  as the company only opens at weekends due to all their studies.\nmakes the company more formal,\" she said.", "id": "high16073.txt"}
