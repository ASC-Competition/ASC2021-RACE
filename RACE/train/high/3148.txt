The garden is a place where people can be outside and yet private.\nIf a house has a front and back garden, the front is likely to be formal  and decorative , with a lawn (an area of grass) or fancy flower borders. The back garden usually also has a lawn and flower beds, and sometimes a vegetable plot  fruit trees. There's often a bird table, on which food is put for birds, and a small simple house in which garden tools are kept.\nMany British people spend quite a lot of money on their gardens and even the smallest may contain different kinds of flowers and plants. For them gardening is a hobby and they take pride in their gardens. Some towns and villages have competitions for the best-kept small garden. People with a small garden, or no garden at all, can rent a piece of land, on which most grow vegetables.\nThere are garden centers near most towns, selling everything a gardener might need, from flower pots to fish ponds as well as many types of plants.\nThe British interest in gardening affects the appearance of whole towns. Public parks and some roads often have bright displays of flowers in summer and public buildings have windows boxes  and hanging baskets. Towns and villages enter for the Britain in Bloom competition every year.", "id": "high3148.txt"}
