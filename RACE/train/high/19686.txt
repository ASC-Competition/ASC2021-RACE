The comprehensive study, which draws on the wisdom, life experience and regrets of almost 2,000 adults between the ages of 16 and 65, also found we should be earning the average wage by the age of 30.\nResearchers also revealed 19 is the best age to start a full-time job, while we should feel free to enjoy the first holiday without mum and dad two years later. Early 20s should also include moving out of home, buying our first car and flying to sunnier places for the first time with a boyfriend or girlfriend.\nA spokeswoman for Amigo Loans, which commissioned the study, said: \"It's normal to want to achieve certain things by certain ages and it's good to be ambitious. \"Borrowing money to achieve life's milestones, such as moving out, buying a car or starting a business is harder than ever for ordinary, hard-working people and our research shows nearly half of 16-34 year-olds expect to turn to their family and friends for financial help to achieve their life goals. Indeed, nearly 80 per cent of our guarantors are family members.\"\nAs we head to late 30s and early 40s, we ought to be aiming to have moved to slightly bigger second home, have earnings of around PS40k a year or more, and even set up our own business.\nThe study also looked into the subject of pressure and the part it plays in helping us achieve our goals. One in three people said they felt there was more pressure on the current generation to reach milestones within specific time frames. But according to the data, a large percentage of us also put the pressure on ourselves to achieve things by certain times.", "id": "high19686.txt"}
