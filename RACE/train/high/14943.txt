Eduardo, 47, and Marcos, 15, stepped onto the balcony  of their two-story home. Immediately, Marcos' s eye was caught by a flame from one of their neighbors' houses.\n\"Dad, the house is on fire!\" Marcos cried. Dressed only in shorts, the barefoot teen\ndashed towards the Mas' home with his dad. Grandmother Yim Ma, mother Suzanne Ma, and son Nathan Ma were gathered on the front grassland shouting for help. When the Ugartes got there, they saw through the open front door that father Alex Ma was falling down the stairs, coughing, his face black with dirt.\n\"Is anyone else in the house?\" Eduardo asked.\n\"My son!\" Alex managed to say, pointing to the second floor.\nEduardo started up the stairs, but thick, black smoke, swirling ash, and extreme heatforced him to his knees. He inched upstairs and down the hall where Alex said he would find Cody, eight, who had locked himself in a bedroom. \"I'd never seen smoke like that,\" says Eduardo. \"My glasses immediately turned black from the ash.\"\nAs the fire spread across the hall, Eduardo banged on the bedroom door and tried to turn the handle. But Cody didn't respond, and Eduardo made his way back downstairs. At the same time, Marcos saw Yim and Suzanne pulling an aluminum  ladder out of the garage. \"Cody was standing at the window, screaming for help,\" says Marcos.\n\"I knew I had to do something.\" He grabbed the ladder, positioned it near the window, and climbed towards the boy. When Marcos reached the window, he pushed the screen into the room and persuaded Cody out. \"It's OK,\" Marcos told him. \"I've got you.\" Holding Cody with one arm, Marcos moved down the ladder. Halfway down, he handed the boy to a neighbor.\nThe day after the fire, Alex visited Marcos. \"Thank you for saving my son,\" Alex said. \"You are his hero forever.\"", "id": "high14943.txt"}
