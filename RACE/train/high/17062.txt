When I asked her where that belief came from, she said her father.\nMost of us spend many of our waking hours at work. How we think about those hours will determine how good or bad we feel about our lives.\nHow would you complete the sentence: \"Work is....\"? How many of us say that work is fulfilling? How many say work is fun?\nChanging Limiting Beliefs\nAlmost everyone I talk to has limiting beliefs about money or work. I worked with my friend using the walking belief change described in Debug Your Mental Software. When it came time to come up with a new belief, she struggled. She even asked me: \"What's the opposite of slavery?\" So strong was the old belief that she couldn't think of the opposite.\nWhat's Your Work Belief?\nIf you think work is bad, you'll end up working in an unfulfilling job regardless of how much it pays. If you think work is freedom, you'll enjoy your work because it fulfills you. I call it \"soul work.\" If you're doing the work you love, it will be energizing, freeing.\nMuch of our work ethic  starts in childhood by watching our parents. How did they talk about work? Did they hate it, or did they love it? The truth is probably somewhere in between. Many of us say we don't want a job \"like my parent had\" or a job where they're stuck inside a small room. But many of us end up with jobs like that. Sometimes it's how we approach the tasks of our jobs that make the difference.\nIt's possible to make even the most ordinary job meaningful and fulfilling. If it isn't possible for you to do that, then it is time to think about \"evolving out of the job\". Sometimes just quitting a job because it's boring is the wrong thing to do, but thinking about where you want to be and if you need more education is a good idea.\nSome young people seem to have trouble starting jobs or finishing college. Has our economy discouraged them? A recent movie I saw had a grown man (over thirty) telling his friends that he's a \"stay-at-home-son.\" Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.  \nI had breakfast at my local Perkins yesterday. Kristin took my order. She was bubbly and full of energy compared to the other waitresses. I watched as she remembered everything a family of four staying at a neighboring hotel had ordered the day before. Kristin loved people and loved her job. She has the kind of attitude and work ethic that employers crave.\nWhat's your work belief? Does it limit you? Could you tune it up to live a better life right now? If most of us are going to spend 30 years working, shouldn't we try to make it enjoyable? Could it be that work is freedom or right work is energizing or something even better?", "id": "high17062.txt"}
