This term, my favorite teacher, Miss Mao, no longer teaches us. I want to see her, but I'm afraid that she no longer likes me and I don't want to trouble her. I really miss her. What should I do? \n                                                                Tian Yan \nDear Tian Yan, \nIt's bad luck that you have lost your favorite teacher. But, if she is still in your school, nothing can stop you going to see her. When she isn't busy, ask her if she minds having a quick chat. You can then tell her she was your favorite teacher--everyone is happy to know that they are liked!\nIf she has left the school, it will be more difficult to meet her. It will be hard, but remember people always come and go in their lives. We can't rely on them to be with us all the time.\nYou may be sad to say goodbye to her, but we can remember and learn from her. Think of her best qualities.\nYou could also try looking for similar qualities in your other teachers. Study hard and give your new teacher a chance. In time, you might start to see that he or she has different qualities to learn from.\nFinally, you can not completely rely on other people to get you through your studies , or even your life.\n                                                                Editor", "id": "high16873.txt"}
