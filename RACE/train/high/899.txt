This one was really working with the sea turtles   and practicing conservation . It just seemed like the perfect science field trip for kids who think they want to get into science to see what it's really like to be out in the field and enjoy themselves.\"\nEmily said her time on the turtle program, which was the focus of the trip, was \"crazy.\" \"We were walking on the beach at night and you can't see anything--just see a big black dot.\" She said with a laugh. \"I was not expecting the turtles to be that big.\" The turtles are leatherback turtles, which are becoming extinct   because their eggs are used as food.\n\"When they would move their legs while laying their eggs they were really hard to control because they were a lot more powerful than you would imagine,\" Emily said.\nOnce the eggs were collected, the students took them back to a hatchery  and dug holes to copy the hole the mother turtle had made and then buried the eggs for the 60 days needed to hatch.\n\"The experience was so cool,\" Emily said. \"You go to another country to see what their culture is like and learn what their everyday lives are like. It made me really want to help out my mom a lot more than I do, and value what I have.\"", "id": "high899.txt"}
