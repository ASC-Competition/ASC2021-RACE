BBC's Sean Coughlan described it in a recent report.\nAccording to Coughlan, at the very beginning it is not hard to spot something familiar to Chinese-a stream of parents arriving with their sons and daughters at the student village. Mothers, fathers and a teenager-now most likely taller than they are - stand together like the three might have done on the first day of primary school.\n\"The approach road to the student village is a long traffic jam of family cars, stuffed full with boxes, pillows and nervous families,\" he writes. \"The door closes on a student's room and parents and children go their separate ways. For many families, if childhood has a final moment, this is it.\"\nBut saying goodbye to parents is not the only similarity between college freshmen in the UK and China. In both cases, new arrivals most want to know about their Internet connections. \"It's their most urgent concern,\" notes Coughlan.\nEven on their first day, university in the UK won't be an entirely lonely experience for some new students. \"Before they arrive they have been using social networking to get to know their future roommates,\" writes Coughlan.\nStill, the first night is something no UK university student ever forgets. There are people they meet and then spend three years avoiding and people who become their friends for the rest of their lives. First week stories are all about over-partying, bad cooking and misguided clothing, Coughlan says.\nAs he concludes: \"These new students are entering their own soap opera of romance, friendship and ambition. It's a huge adventure that they've worked for years to achieve.\"", "id": "high15908.txt"}
