And about 20 percent of health-conscious Australians have eaten the national symbol already. \n \"It's low in fat, it's got high protein levels and it's very clean in the sense that basically it's the free-range animal,\" said Peter Ampt of the University of New South Wales's institute\nof environmental studies.", "id": "high16583.txt"}
