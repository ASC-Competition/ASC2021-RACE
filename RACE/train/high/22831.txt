The BBC has learnt that in 2009 there were l,889 complaints about examiners,of which just 51 were supported.\nComplaints that were rejected included ''Candidate crashed during test--claims examiner distracted \" and \"Candidate says examiner took her on busy roads during rush hour,which was unfair\".\nSomeone else seemingly failed to understand the nature of an emergency stop when the complaint was filed that an emergency stop was conducted without warning.", "id": "high22831.txt"}
