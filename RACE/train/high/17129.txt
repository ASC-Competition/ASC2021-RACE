One day when government officials were rebuilding an office, they found a mouse hole in a corner and used smoke to force the mice inside the hole to come out. A while later they indeed saw mice running out, one after another.\nThen, everyone thought that all the mice had escaped. But just as they were just about to start to clean up, they saw two mice squeezing out at the exit of the hole. After some endeavor, the mice finally got out. The strange thing was that after they came out of the hole, they did not run away immediately. Instead, one chased after the other near the exit of the hole. It seemed that one was trying to bite the tail of the other.\nEveryone was puzzled, so they stepped closer to take a look. They realized that one of the mice was blind and could not see anything, and the other one was trying to allow the blind mouse to bite on his tail so he could pull the blind one with him to escape.\nAfter witnessing what happened, everyone was speechless and lost in thought. During meal time, the group of people sat down in a circle and started to chat about what happened to the two mice.\nOne serious Rome official said: \"I think the relationship between those two mice was that of emperor and minister.\" The others thought for a while and said: \"That was why!\" Thus the Rome official showed his arrogance .\nA smart Israeli said: \"I think the relationship between those two mice was husband and wife.\" Again the others thought for a while, and all felt it made sense; so they expressed agreement. Therefore, the Israeli's countenance (,)showed self-satisfaction.\nA Chinese, who was accustomed to the firm tradition of loyalty to parents, said: \"I think the relationship between those two mice was that of mother and son.\" Once again the others thought for a while, and felt this was more reasonable. So they expressed agreement yet another time. Therefore, the face of the Chinese showed professional modesty.\nAt that moment, one pure-minded Samaritan  who was squatted  on the ground resting his chin in his hands, bewilderedly  looked at other people, and asked: \"Why did those two mice have to have a certain relationship?\"\nSuddenly, the atmosphere froze. Then the group looked back at the Samaritan and remained speechless. The Rome official, the Israeli and the Chinese who had spoken earlier all lowered their heads in shame, and did not dare to respond.\nIn fact, the true love is not established on benefit, friendship and loyalty or blood relationship. Instead, it is based on no relationship.", "id": "high17129.txt"}
