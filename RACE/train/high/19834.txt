Many remember with fear the 2008 milk powder scandal, in which infant formula laced with melamine caused at least six deaths and 300,000 children to fall ill.\nBeijing last month made public an illegal operation in eastern Shandong province in which a hospital pharmacist and her daughter traded $88m in vaccines that may have been compromised because they were expired or improperly stored or transported.\nThe China Food and Drug Administration said, however, that the vaccines posed no greater than the normal risk to patients. \"We don't see that the vaccines' effectiveness has been reduced,\" added the health watchdog in a report.\nNonetheless, health officials fear a backlash against Chinese-manufactured vaccines, which already have a reputation for being more dangerous than those made overseas. \nWang Yuedan, deputy director of Peking University's immunology department, said the key to evaluating risks is to check whether package seals are broken or for pollution with micro-organisms. \"The vaccines in the Shandong case don't have those problems,\" he said.\nThose vaccines had been subject to higher than normal temperatures that could have lowered their effectiveness and reduced their protective value. But the official investigation showed the vaccines \"are still effective\", he said.\nBeijing, which publicized the affair almost a year after it was exposed, and several years after it started, appeared eager to show commitment to crack down on abuses by announcing the action, political analysts said.\nThe CFDA said a system was being set up to track vaccines from production to use.\nThe World Health Organization warned the scandal could endanger China's public health gains if parents become distrustful of vaccines. It also expressed confidence in Chinese vaccines, saying public immunization campaigns had erased polio  and sharply reduced cases of hepatitis B and measles.", "id": "high19834.txt"}
