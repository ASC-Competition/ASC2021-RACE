Do you move your lips  when reading silently?\n2. Do you point to words with your finger as you read?\n3. Do you move your head from side to side as you read?\n4.

Then you will not have a free finger to use in pointing while reading.\nIf you move your head, place your chin in one hand, and hold your head still(,).\nIf you read no more than one or two or three words at a time, you need to work very hard in learning to take in more words at each glance  as your eyes travel across the lines of words.", "id": "high2271.txt"}
