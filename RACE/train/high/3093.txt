The person I was talking to agreed with me that it was, in his words, \"a wonderfully written book.\" However, he then _ to talk about Mr. Obama in a way that suggested he had no idea of his background at all. I sensed that I was talking to a book liar .\nAnd it seems that he is not the only one. Clearly two thirds of people have lied about reading a book which they haven't. In The World Book Day survey, Dreams From My Father is at number 9. The survey lists top ten books, and various authors, which people have lied about reading. As I'm not one to lie too often, I'll admit here and now that I haven't read the entire ten books. But I am pleased to say that I have read the book at number one, George Orwell's 1984. I think it's absolutely outstanding.\nAsked why they lied, the most common reason was to impress someone they were speaking to. This could be difficult if the conversation became more in-depth!\nThe World Book Day survey also has some other interesting information in it. It shows that many people lie about having read classical works by Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, Charles Dickens and so on. But when asked which authors they actually enjoy, they named JK Rowling, Jilly Cooper, and Stephen King. Forty-one percent of people asked admitted they turned to the back of the book to read the end before finishing the story.\nSo which books have you lied about reading --if any -- and which is your favorite?", "id": "high3093.txt"}
