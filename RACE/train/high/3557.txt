These days, however, staying at an eco-hotel doesn't necessarily mean vacationing in a tree house in the Costa Rican jungle, although that is certainly a choice.\nThe majority of eco-hotels fall into several categories: hotels and resorts that conserve ecologically important habitats; \"green\" hotels that reduce, recycle, minimize waste, and protect water; sustainable hotels that harvest food from gardens on the hotel property or get part or all of their power from renewable energy; hotels that encourage community involvement such as guests taking part in trail clearing; and hotels that offer some form of environmental education to their guests.\nAs such, eco-hotels are a various group. Stylish urban hotels like the Willard Inter-Continental Washington focus on energy conservation whereas the Rosario Resort & Spa on Orcas Island in Washington State offers a wildly popular \"green\" vacation package where guests can \"take a hike, clear a trail\".\nNo matter what you call them, eco-hotel, eco-lodge, eco-resort, or green hotel, they're all part of the \"greening\" of the tourism industry.\nPart of what drives this greening of the hotel industry is no doubt competition.
