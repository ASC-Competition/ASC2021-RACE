Most of us have done this in the privacy of our own room when we were kids and as adults, in the privacy of our homes. Me? I love to do that when I drive! I turn on the radio, find a song that I can sing along too and pretty soon my arms are in the air and I am moving along to the rhythm. Most of the time, I do this on my way to work.\nYes, that is true, I will be in my nice work clothes, jamming while driving or stopped at a traffic light I get weird looks from some people and others laugh. Personally, I love to get lost in the rhythm of a song which leads me to share with you the importance of being silly!\nThe definition for the word silly, according to the dictionary is: stupid, foolish and nonsensical. I know many people do not want to look foolish. So they walk around all serious, which in all honesty, is foolish!\nNo one is perfect, I repeat: no one is perfect. I don't care how educated, how thin, how beautiful, how simple, how frugal  , how rich, and so on...No one is perfect! So why pretend to be something you are not?\nLife is so short. You never know when this beautiful journey will be over, so why waste a single second on being so full of rigidity ? Here is a quote by Souza, that I think says it all and is a great recipe for life:\n\"Dance as though no one is watching you,\nLove as though you have never been hurt before,\nSing as though no one can hear you,\nLive as though heaven is on earth.\"\nWhen we were kids, we had no idea of what limitations were and we had no care in the world so we could do things without worrying about how we appeared to others. However, as we grew up, we lost that childlike innocence.\nSo don't lose the child that still lives within you. The next time you feel down, go turn on your favorite song, and sing and dance along like there is no tomorrow or watch something that makes you laugh. Laughter is the best medicine to whatever ails (......) you and nothing is better than laughing so hard that your stomach hurts. Trust me, you will feel a whole lot better, and who doesn't want to feel good?", "id": "high5027.txt"}
