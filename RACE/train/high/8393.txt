But I must accept the consequences. I would rather have a live daughter who I will never see again than a dead daughter.\"\nIt is the first time that Laura's mother, Babs Muller, has spoken out against the trip. Laura's parents are divorced and the girl has lived with her father since she was six. Her father Dick Dekker supports Laura's plans. However, the Dutch Child Protection Board has decided to place the girl under supervision   for two months to ascertain whether she is mentally and physically capable of undertaking the journey.\nMs Muller says she is confident that Laura is technically capable of making the journey. \"She can sail like the devil. That's not the problem.\" However, she is afraid of the problems a 13-year-old girl can encounter in the harbors of Third-World countries and of the psychological   pressure of being alone for such a long period on the ocean. \"The most important thing, in my eyes, is that she is not yet an adult.\"\nMs Muller says she told Laura once before that she was opposed to the idea. Her daughter replied, \"If you forbid me, you will have ruined my entire life. Then I'll never want to see you again.\" However, Laura's mother says that reports that a camera team is planning to follow her around the world could change her opinion about the trip.", "id": "high8393.txt"}
