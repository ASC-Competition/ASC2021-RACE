The more we try to save time, the less time we seem to have. In every area of our lives we are doing things faster. And many of us live in towns and cities which are getting noisier and more stressful as each day passes. But now a worldwide movement, whose aim is to slow life down, has started. Its supporters are people who believe that a happier and healthier way of life is possible.\nThe Slow Food movement was founded the day that an Italian journalist, Carlo Petrini, saw that McDonald's had opened a restaurant in a beautiful square in Rome. He thought it was sad that many people today live too quickly to sit down for a proper meal and only eat much fast food. He decided that he had to try to do something about it and so he started the Slow Food movement. Slow Food has become a global organization ever since and now has more than 80,000 members in 100 countries.\nSlow Food also encourages people to eat local and regional food, to use local shops and markets, to eat out in small family restaurants, and to cook with traditional recipes.\nThe idea of Slow Cities was inspired by the Slow Food movement. The aim of Slow Cities is to improve people's quality of life. Towns which want to become a Slow City have to reduce traffic and noise, increase the number of green areas, plant trees, build pedestrian zones, and promote local businesses and traditions. Now it has spread to other countries all over the world, from the UK to Japan and Australia. There are now 135 Slow Cities in 24 countries across the world that have been named since founding of the organization in 1999. Gao Chun County, in east China's Jiangsu Province, is expected to be named the first \"Slow City\" in China next year.\n\"Slow Cities are about having a community life in the town,\" said a local resident. \"It is not 'slow' as in 'stupid'. It is 'slow' as in the opposite of 'worried' and 'stressful'.\"\nBut not everybody is happy. For teenagers, who have to go 25km to Norwich, the nearest city, to buy CDs, living in a Slow City is not very attractive. \"It's all right here,\" says Lewis Cook, 16. \"But if you want excitement, you have to go to Norwich. We need more things here for young people.\"", "id": "high15479.txt"}
