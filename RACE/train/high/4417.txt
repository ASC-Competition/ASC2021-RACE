Those who drank two or more sweetened soft drinks a week had an 87 percent higher risk of being among those who got pancreatic cancer.\nPereira said he believed the findings would apply elsewhere.\n\"Singapore is a wealthy country with excellent healthcare. Favorite pastimes  are eating and shopping, so the findings should apply to other western countries.\" he said.\nBut Susan Mayne of the Yale Cancer Center at Yale University in Connecticut was cautious.\n\"Although this study found a risk, the finding was based on a relatively small number of cases and it remains unclear whether it was a causal  connection or not.\" Said Mayne, who serves on thee board of the journal, which is published by the American Association for Cancer Research.\nPancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest form of cancer, with 230,000 cases globally. In the United States, 37,680 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in a year and 34, 290 die of it.", "id": "high4417.txt"}
