But to those who are new to it all, sometimes it can be confusing.\nOctober is usually the busiest month in the college calendar. Universities have something called Freshers' Week for their newcomers. It's a great opportunity to make new friends, join lots of clubs and settle into university life.\nHowever, having just left the comfort of home and all your friends behind, the prospect   of meeting lots of strangers in big halls can be nerve-wracking  . Where do you start? Who should you make friends with? Which clubs should you join?\nLuckily, there will be thousands of others in the same boat as you worrying about starting their university social life on the right foot. So just take it all in slowly. Don't rush into anything that you'll regret for the next three years.\nHere are some top advice from past students on how to survive Freshers' Week:\n* Learn rules. Make sure you know British social etiquette  . Have a few wine glasses and snacks handy for your housemates and friends.\n* Be kind. Sometimes cups of tea or even slices of toast can give you a head start in making friends.\n* Be sociable. The more active you are, the more likely you'll be to meet new people than if you're someone who never leaves his room.\n* Bring a doorstop. Keep your door open when you're in and that sends positive messages to your neighbors that you're friendly.\nSo with a bit of clever planning and effort, Freshers' Week can give you a great start to your university life and soon you'll be passing on your experience to next year's freshers.", "id": "high5058.txt"}
