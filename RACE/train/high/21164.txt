Suicide can be contagious ,\" Zhang said.\nThe university reacted promptly to the first suicide on October 23.\nAdvisors and class leaders conducted dorm-to-dorm checks to find students suffering depression. Then psychologists offered one-on-one counseling to them.\nNotice boards publicizing tips for identifying peers' mental problems and offering help were set up in front of dorm buildings. Leaflets  carrying similar information were handed out to each dorm.\nHowever, the second suicide came seven days later.\nBoth students were described as men of few words. Their schoolmates didn't see anything to indicate suicide.\nZhang revealed that the two students had been bothered by mental disorders. But the school didn't know this until the students' close friends outside school and their parents unveiled  the truth after the suicides.\nAccording to Zhang, there are only three full-time counselors  working in the university's counseling center for its 60,000 students. He complained: \"It's unrealistic to rely only on counselors to detect students' mental problems.\"\nSome universities in the US may be able to offer solutions to Zhang's worries. They have established programs to train students to be the bridge between troubled friends and counselors.\nAt Worcester Polytechnic Institute, at Worcester, Massachusetts, US, young people in the Student Support Network role play to learn how to detect SOS signals from their schoolmates.\nThey also practice how to gently persuade emotionally troubled students to go for professional help.\nTo develop such empathy , many universities in China have organized campus events to popularize knowledge about mental health. But these are not that attractive to students.\nKe Juanjuan, 24, is pursuing a master's degree in English translation at HUST. Ke has found that few of her peers will pay attention to activities about mental health when they are not troubled by it.\nRather than bombard students with the words \"mental health\", Ke suggested the school organize lectures and workshops concerning study, job-hunting and relationships. She explained: \"Students care about these topics. They tend to have problems in these areas and may thus get stuck in depression.\n\"By helping students better deal with these problems, the school can effectively prevent self-inflicted injury and suicide among students.\"\nEffective prevention comes from long-term education for life instead of temporary intervention  to meet an emergency, said Hu Yi'an. Hu delivers a course of lectures on life and death at Guangzhou University. He worries that universities have paid little attention to education for life.\n\"Education for life helps students respect and love life so they won't resort  to ending their lives when they have difficulties,\" said Hu.\nAccording to Hu, the principles can be incorporated  into everyday teaching.", "id": "high21164.txt"}
