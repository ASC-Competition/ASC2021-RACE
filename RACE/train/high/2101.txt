Living alone, every day he worked in his garden. In all the countryside there was no garden so lovely as his. All sorts of flowers grew there, blooming in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to see, and pleasant odors to smell.\nHans had many friends, the most devoted being the Miller. So devoted was the rich Miller to Hans that he'd never go by his garden without plucking a large bunch of flowers or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with fruits. The Miller used to talk about noble ideas, and Hans nodded and smiled, feeling proud of having such a friend.\nThe neighbors thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave Hans anything in return, though he had hundreds of sacks of flour, many cows and sheep, but Hans never troubled his head about these, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things about the unselfishness of true friendship.\nIn spring, summer, and autumn Hans was very happy, but when winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to sell, he suffered from cold and hunger. Though extremely lonely, the Miller never came to see him then.\n\"There's no good in going to see Hans while the snow lasts.\" The Miller said to his wife, \"When people are in trouble they shouldn't be bothered. So I'll wait till the spring comes when he's happy to give me flowers.\"\n\"You're certainly very thoughtful,\" answered his wife, \"It's quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship.\"\n\"Couldn't we ask Hans up here?\" said their son. \"I'll give him half my meal, and show him my white rabbits.\"\n\"How silly you are!\" cried the Miller. \"I really don't know what's the use of sending you to school. If Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, our good supper, and our red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature. I am his best friend, and I'll always watch over him, and see that he's not led into any temptation. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me for some flour. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they shouldn't be confused. The words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that.\" He looked seriously at his son, who felt so ashamed that he hung his head down, and grew quite scared, and began to cry into his tea.\nSpring coming, the Miller went down to see Hans. Again he talked about friendship. \"Hans, friendship never forgets. I'm afraid you don't understand the poetry of life. See, how lovely your roses are!\"\nHans said he wanted to sell them in the market to buy back his things which were sold during the hard time of the winter.\n\"I'll give you many good things. I think being generous is the base of friendship.\" said the Miller. \"And now, as I'll give you many good things, I'm sure you'd like to give me some flowers in return. Here's the basket, and fill it quite full.\"\nPoor Hans was afraid to say anything. He ran and plucked all his pretty roses, and filled the Miller's basket, imagining the many good things promised by the Miller.\nThe next day he heard the Miller calling: \"Hans, would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?\"\n\"I'm sorry, but I am really very busy today.\"\n\"Well,\" said the Miller, \"considering that I'm going to give you my things, it's rather unfriendly of you to refuse. Upon my word, you mustn't mind my speaking quite plainly to you.\"\nPoor Hans was driven by his friendship theory to work hard for his best friend, leaving his garden dry and wasted.\nOne evening Hans was sitting by fire when the Miller came.\n\"Hans,\" cried the Miller, \"My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I'm going for the Doctor. But he lives so far away, and it's such a bad windy night. It has just occurred to me that you can go instead of me. You know I'm going to give you my good things, so you should do something for me in return.\"\n\"Certainly,\" cried Hans. He struggled into the stormy night, and got the doctor to ride a horse to the Miller's house in time to save the boy. However, Hans got lost in the darkness, and wandered off into a deep pool, drowned.\nAt Hans' funeral, the Miller said, \"I was his best friend. I should walk at the head of the procession.\" Every now and then he wiped his eyes with a handkerchief.", "id": "high2101.txt"}
