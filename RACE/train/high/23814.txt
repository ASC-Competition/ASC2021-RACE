This year, though, Kelson Poepoe, a conservationist on Hawaii's prefix = st1 /MolokaiIsland, helped publish an unusual version on this model. Poepoe and his colleagues decided to print a calendar telling people when not to fish.\nMany of the Homestead's residents still follow an existence lifestyle, gathering roughly one-third of their food by fishing in nearby Mo'omomi Bay. But, even though overfishing has exhausted fish populations throughout Hawaii, Mo'omomi Bay's fishery is booming, with a higher fish density  than nearly anywhere else in the main islands.\nThe new calendar is based on the ancient fishing practices that have helped keep those populations strong. Hawaiians have long known that carefully tended resources will renew themselves. To make this process easier, fishermen traditionally worked hard to understand and adapt to fish behavior. For example, they closely monitored where and when key species gathered to reproduce, and they prevented fishing during those times. By contrast, most of today's fishermen see spawning  periods as a chance to get large numbers of fish, which can cause population break down.\nWhile these traditional methods have largely died out, they are still practiced by Poepoe and his fellow men at Mo'omomi Bay. \"We have a rule of conduct that basically says, take only what you can eat fresh, don't stock your fridge, and don't take the fish when they spawn,\" Poepoe said.\nIn 1993, Poepoe helped found the conservation group Hui Malama Mo'omomi to teach  _ to new generations, and publishing the calendar is a key part of this move. It follows the lunar cycle, declaring when certain species are not available or \"taboo.\" It also includes helpful hints about fish lifecycles, detailing exactly where in the bay certain kinds of fish like to gather, how to tell males from females, and which fishing methods are least likely to harm fish populations long-term.\nSo far, these methods have helped keep Mo'omomi Bay's fish number totals far higher than elsewhere in the surrounding islands.\nWith hopes of copying this success, a number of local groups are interested in creating similar calendars for other coastal areas. But that's a difficult project, partly because fish habits are highly local, meaning that the information in the calendar applies mainly to Mo'omomi Bay. Still, these groups believe the basic methods are transferable.", "id": "high23814.txt"}
