There are prehistoric drawings which show that bows and arrows were used 20 000 years ago. In early times, animals were always hunted and killed with bows and arrows. Good archers were very important when country fought against country. One of the most famous legends(,) in European history is the story of Wilhelm Tell. He was a Swiss who refused to work for an Austrian, and was ordered to shoot an apple from the head of his son. He hit the apple, and then shot the Austrian. Switzerland has been free since then, so the story goes.\nArchers shoot at targets at 30, 50, 70 or 90 meters' distance from them. The targets are round,80 centimeters across, and have 5 circles painted round the centre. Bows are made of steel, wood and strong plastic, and arrows of wood. The sport is enjoyed in the open air in summer and in a building in winter. Archery is good for the chest, the arms and the back. Men and women can shoot together since being strong is not so important. Women usually use lighter bows. People who can't walk or who have been ill can also enjoy it. For Zen Buddhists  archery is not only a sport but also something deeper. It helps the individual to understand himself and the meaning of life.", "id": "high7775.txt"}
