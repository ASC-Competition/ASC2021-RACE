He was obviously a wealthy man ---- they could tell that from the finely tailored business suit he was wearing and the gold watch chain that decorated his left pocket.\nThe first beggar whispered to the second with excitement, \"He's coming our way!\"\nThe two tried not to look directly at the man as he stepped closer to them, but they couldn't help glaring at him with expectation as he reached into his pocket and took something out.\n\"Thunk\" was the only sound they heard as what looked like a piece of hard candy, wrapped doubly in tissue paper, hit each of their waiting hats. The rich man turned and continued on his way, not making a backward glance.\n\"How disgusting  !\" said the first beggar, as soon as the rich man was out of sound range. \"He could have easily left us a few coins or a spare bill, but he tricks us with a piece of rock candy.\"\nHe looked at the wrapped offering with disgust. \"Who does he think we are ---- children? There's no way we can even eat this ---- we have no teeth.\"\nThe beggar picked up the object with the very tips of his fingers and threw it into the gutter . He watched as it floated a few yards in the stream of smelly water and disappeared at the end of the street. Then, he gathered up his things and walked away.\nThe second beggar looked down at the candy in his hat, then at his departing friend. His first impulse   was to throw the donation in the trashcan under the street light. But his second thought made him change his mind.\n\"I haven't had anything like this for ages,\" he thought. \"I can't chew   it, but I can suck on it for a while, and the sugary juices will stay in my mouth for a long time. How nice of that man to offer me something so sweet.\"\nHe eagerly opened the paper outside, then paused as his hands touched the white tissue paper inside. \"Maybe I should save it for another time,\" he thought. \"It won't spoil, and I could eat it later when I'm really hungry.\"\nThe beggar hesitated for a moment, then declared aloud, \"Who cares? He wanted me to have it anyway. I might as well enjoy it now.\"\nWith that, he unwrapped the white tissue paper, but to his surprise, there was no hard rock candy inside. Instead, into his fingers fell a shiny white pearl worth thousands of dollars.", "id": "high18940.txt"}
