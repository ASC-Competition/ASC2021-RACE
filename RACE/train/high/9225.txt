Then I saw one of the camp _ approaching me. \"Oh great,\" I thought, since counselors were always trying to cheer you up or make you laugh.\n\"Hey,\" he said, \"mind if I have a seat?\" I shrugged . I wasn't going to encourage him, but I couldn't exactly stop him, either. He sat down alongside me and extended a hand. \"I'm Gary,\" he said, \"and you're Erica, right?\" I nodded. \"You don't exactly look like you're having a good time,\" he began.\nI crossed my arms and gritted my teeth. \"Look,\" I said, \"I didn't want to come to camp, I don't like it, I'm not having fun, and it basically stinks.\" I glared at Gary.\n\"So there's nothing here at all for you, huh?\" he asked.\n\"Nothing,\" I answered.\n\"Let me show you something,\" said Gary. He got up, and I followed him along the path until I heard a sound like a roaring freight train.\n\"What's that?\" I asked.\n\"Wait and see,\" he replied, with a small smile.\nWhen we rounded the corner, I couldn't believe what I saw. There was the biggest waterfall I could ever imagine, right in front of me. \"Cool!\" I said, and I could feel my eyes getting bigger and a smile tugging at my mouth.\n\"Still think there's nothing here for you?\" asked Gary. \"Because there's a whole lot more of this kind of 'nothing' around here.\"\nI had to admit, the waterfall was impressive.\n\"Look,\" said Gary, \"camp is what you make it. You can be sullen  and closed-minded and have a rotten four weeks, or you can take a look around you and see some of the incredible sights and appreciate the opportunity. It would be useless for me to try to make you have fun. You can only do that for yourself. But if you loosen up a little, you might actually have a good time.\" With that, he turned and walked away, leaving me on the path.\nThat night, by the campfire, I found myself singing along with everyone else. By the time the four weeks were up, I didn't want to leave. I'd seen some amazing things and made some great friends.\nBeauty is where you find it. Life is what you make it. I think it's going to be a good year this year. I mean, I'm going to work to make it one. Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get to go back to camp next year!", "id": "high9225.txt"}
