She copied their actions and way of life -- eating plants and getting down on her hands and knees to walk the way a gorilla does. It was a new relationship.\nDiane Fossey was murdered in Rwanda in 1985 and her story was made into the popular filmGorillas in the Mist. It was a long way fromKing Kong, which is about a gorilla as a monster (a frightening animal), and helped to show a new idea: the real monster is man, while the gorilla is to be admired.\nToday there are thought to be around 48,000 lowland gorillas and maybe 400--450 mountain gorillas in the wild. From the Congo in West Africa, to Rwanda and Uganda further east, they are endangered by hunting and by the cutting down of their forest homes.\nSome time ago, I found in my letterbox a little magazine from the World Wide Fund for Nature. It had two photos side by side. One was of a young gorilla. \"This is a species of mammal ,\" said the words below it. \"It is being destroyed by man. We must save it for our own good.\" The other photo showed a human baby. The words also read, \"This is a species of mammal,\" but then went on: \"It is the most destructive  on earth. We must retrain it for its own good.\"", "id": "high7709.txt"}
