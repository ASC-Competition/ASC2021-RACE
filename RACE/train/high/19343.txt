There are three important things. These three things are spelling, pronunciation and meaning.\nFirst, a dictionary will tell you the spelling of a word. If you are not sure about the spelling of a word, you can try to find the correct spelling in a dictionary. Words are listed in an alphabetical  order--- a, b, c and so on. For example, on a dictionary page the \"poor\" comes before \"poverty\" and the word \"poverty\" comes before the \"power\". The words are always given in alphabetical order. The second thing, a dictionary will tell you the pronunciation. Most dictionaries give phonetic  , or sound alphabet. The phonetic alphabet  shows pronunciation. The third thing, a dictionary will tell you the meaning of words. You can look up a word and find out what it means. Many words have more than one meaning, and a good dictionary will tell you all of the word's meanings. For example, in English the common word \"get\" has over 20 different meanings.", "id": "high19343.txt"}
