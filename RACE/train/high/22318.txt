Loneliness, anxiety and depression are the most common. \nGrown-up children are to take care of not only their parents, but also to respect their feelings, by having more heart-to-heart conversations with them.

They should undertake the responsibility of visiting aged parents more often and making them feel wanted. \nThere is a lot more communities could do to help make senior citizens' life better. To begin with, they could recruitcommunity volunteers, from warm-hearted university students to helpful and devoted middle-aged citizens.\nSenior citizens, too, should make an effort to release tension and prepare for a happy life in their twilight years. They should change their mentality and try to be less emotionally dependent on their children, develop hobbies, extend their social circle, and set new goals to make the rest of their life more interesting.
