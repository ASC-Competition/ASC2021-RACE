Two experts in music, fashion and social networking give their opinions. \nGeorge Ergatoudis ----Head of Music Radio1\n  \" The key thing is Lady Gaga realized by using all the current social networking sites, and connecting that with her fashion, she has become an all-round star. Every time she goes out the door she looks different. She's getting photographed, she's aware of that and she's using it by updating her look literally on a daily basis.\n  Another key thing wat that quite early on, her record label was showing how gifted she is as a musician. The music she makes, the songs she writes and the production she has are all brilliant contemporary pop music. She literally is turning into a global superstar.\"\nCalum Brannan ---Co-Founder of social Networking support company crowd Control HQ \n  \"Social media is a reflection  of what we love, so people are becoming very good at sharing exactly what they love and the brands and musicians they love.\n   The fact she has 10 million Twitter followers and 30million Facebook fans is a massive reflection on Lady Gaga and the influence she has. Once out there, Twitter and Facebook help keep that person's profile  alive. Her fans are always talking about her and sharing everything she does even when she's not on stage or in concert.\n  I think even if she wasn't on Facebook and Twitter, her fans and followers would put her there anyway. But the most important thing is,she is on there and she's using them.\"", "id": "high17070.txt"}
