A little girl, less than two, was pushing her stroller   across the road. It was Sunday morning and traffic was not heavy.\nI stopped my car at once and ran toward her. This little girl knew enough to run from a stranger. I tried to catch her in order that I could get her out of the road.\nSuddenly her father came running down a hill across the road from where I had parked my car. He ran right to her and caught her up, saying \"bad girl\" to her. I picked up the stroller and gave it to him. The father grabbed the stroller and walked toward where he came from without a word.\nI went back and sat in my car for a few minutes with my son. My hands were shaking and tears were about to run out of my eyes. \"Do you feel cold, Mom?\" asked my son. I just shook my head.\nAfter this happened, I thought about how thankful I am. Even though the father didn't say thank you, I feel that I did something good. Doing something for someone else is pleasing, even when it's only a matter of being in the right place at the right time.\nI didn't really \"save\" her, but I feel like it was important that I happened to be there. It is sad that I was the only one who stopped. It really made me a little disappointed that no one else stopped to help.", "id": "high5077.txt"}
