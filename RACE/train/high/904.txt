Over her bald   head, she wore a pink hat that matched her clothes. But the third grader's cheery dressing didn't mask her pain and weary eyes.\nThen a visitor showed up. \"Do you want to write a song?\" asked Anita Kruse, 49, rolling a cart equipped with an electronic keyboard, a microphone and speakers. Simran stared. \"Have you ever written a poem?\" Anita Kruse continued. \"Well, yes,\" Simran said.\nWithin minutes, Simran was reading her poem into the microphone. \"Some bird soaring through the sky,\" she said softly. \"Imagination in its head...\" Anita Kruse added piano music, a few warbling (, ) birds, and finally the girl's voice. Thirty minutes later, she presented Simran with a CD of her first recorded song.\nThat was the beginning of Anita Kruse's project, Purple Songs Can Fly, one that has helped more than 125 young patients write and record songs. As a composer and pianist who had performed at the hospital, Kruse said that the idea of how she could help \"came in one flash\".\nThe effect on the kids has been great. One teenage girl, curling   in pain in her wheelchair, stood unaided to dance to a hip-hop song she had written. A 12-year-old boy with Hodgkin's disease who rarely spoke surprised his doctors with a song he calledI Can Make It.\n\"My time with the kids is heartbreaking because of the severity of their illnesses,\" says Anita Kruse. \"But they also make you happy, when the children are smiling, excited to share their CD with their families.\"\nSimran is now an active sixth grader and cancer-free. From time to time, she and her mother listen to her song,Always Remembering, and they always remember the \"really sweet and nice and loving\" lady who gave them a shining moment in the dark hour.", "id": "high904.txt"}
