And there is no denying that women must face the greater challenges of unknown environments by themselves on their solo trips in the future.\"\nFor most Chinese women traveling alone,they not only focus on the journey process but also long for changes that travel can bring about in their minds . Among more than 9,000 respondents around the world, a majority spoke highly of independent trips which have caused significant changes in themselves, with 36 percent saying they have learned about different cultures,43 percent expressing that they are more confident than before and 56 percent feeling they become more independent.In addition,45 percent of Chinese female travelers think independent trips have helped reshape their outlook on life,well above the international average of merely 15 percent.", "id": "high19758.txt"}
