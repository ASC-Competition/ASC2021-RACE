Just talking about it or writing it down causes you to make it clear in your own mind. How can you use this to increase your brain power? Start writing.\nBy putting thoughts into words, you are telling yourself the logic behind what you think, feel,or only partly understand. Often,explaining a thought is the process of understanding.In other words, you increase your brain power by exercising your\"explain power\".\nAnother benefit of writing is that it helps you remember. Many,if not most,highly productive people are always taking notes.You can try keeping it all in your head,but if you keep a journal  of your ideas the next time you're working on a big project, you'11 probably have more success.\nWant to understand a topic? Write a book about it.That's an extreme example, but if you are learning something new,write a letter to a friend about it,and you will understand it better. Want to invent something? Write an explanation of the problem---why you want to solve it,and why it is worth solving, and you're half-way there.\nWriters don't always write because they clearly understand something beforehand. Often,they write about something because they want to understand it. You can do the same. Writing will help bring you to all understanding. Give it a try.", "id": "high17883.txt"}
