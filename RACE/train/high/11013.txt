I bought the raft for my family. It worked perfectly. It is a great size for the three of us. We hit many rocks and low tree branches drifting down a river, but the raft came out safety. This is an excellent raft. It's durable and floats like it should. Great for kids or adults. And great for family use.\nContact Information of intex Recreation:  Tel:800-876-0987   E-mail: In texrecreation@hotmail.com", "id": "high11013.txt"}
