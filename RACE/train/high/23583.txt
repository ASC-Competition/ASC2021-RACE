Households use one third of the final energy and produce around two thirds of city waste in the European Union. Besides,housing, food,and private transport make up almost 80% of environmental pressures. Therefore there's no doubt that consumers can make a real difference in fighting climate change.\nTo direct consumers towards more environmentally-friendly decisions,we need clear and simple instructions to guide consumption behavior. Actually, two thirds of consumers find it hard to figure out which products are better for the environment, for 58% Europeans think that many businesses just pretend to be green so as to charge higher prices. Thus industry should work harder to give consumers more information about the carbon footprint of their product. For example, inform customers of products made from materials that are recycled,renewable, and/or less carbon-intensive. \nPeople prefer high-quality products that will last long and won't go out of style, though they might sometimes cost more, especially in time of crisis. Firms that make durable  or recyclable products cause people to behave more responsibly, which may help put an end to our \"throw-way\" culture.\nHowever, it is not enough to remind people of green products. It's more important to direct people to follow a practical lifestyle model. Regulations alone cannot achieve this purpose. We call for good business communities to create a loyal group of \"sustainable consumers\".", "id": "high23583.txt"}
