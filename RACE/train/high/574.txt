My 10-year-old daughter came up with the idea of washing other people's cars as well. It was pretty hot outside. She further wanted to give juice for a low cost but not free. I felt happy and decided to help her.\nShe asked me, \"What if we make this 'a smile car wash', mommy? \"I couldn't hold back my tears and encouraged her and other kids to go inside the house and come up with ideas. While I kept myself busy in drying the car, the kids walked up to me with a board of beautiful signs of smiles. They had \"Free Car Wash\" written on it and the theme of their exercise was \"Smile\". It was pretty natural to see a team of kids 5 to 11 years with the task to do something for others.\nAll that seemed natural and came right from their heart. Nothing seemed to matter to them: their playtime, and then heat outside--they just wanted to help and do something nice in the community!\nI helped them make some fresh juice and brought out some waste materials to help clean cars. Passers-by were amazed and one even shouted at them saying \"Good kids\". One of them even tried giving them 5 dollars, which they refused. A pretty heart-warming scene!\nThe following weekend, I saw the idea of the week, the theme of which was \"Global Kindness\". I was moved by such wonderful and loving souls. They made me smile!\nOne of the slogans   on their flag was: \"Do not fear! Smile retrievers  are here.\"", "id": "high574.txt"}
