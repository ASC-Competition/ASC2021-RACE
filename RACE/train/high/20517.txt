{"answers": ["B"], "options": [["Max's mother.", "Max's father.", "Lucy Brown.", "Michael Beattie."]], "questions": ["Who phoned the police first?"], "article": "Two dogs,  Tank and Muck,  joined the extraordinary   animals in the history of the RSPCA,  along with a donkey who saved an old man in a fire. \n    On a quiet afternoon, Tank, Muck and three-year-old Max were thought to be playing in the yard.  But later, Max's mum, Annie, found they had disappeared. \n\"I searched everywhere for him, \" she said. \"And when I couldn't find him I jumped into the car.  I finally found the dogs.  They were running madly around the dam.  I called Paul. \"\n     Michael Beattie from the RSPCA said Annie's neighbor, Lucy Brown, who lived near the dam, 300 meters away from the Smiths' house, was the first to hear the dogs' barking.  She came out and found Max and the two dogs. All of them were wet.  So she took him inside and gave him a hot shower. \nPaul Smith said, \"When I received my wife's call, I  _ . I couldn't believe it.  I didn't know what I should do!  Then I called the police. \"\n     Meanwhile Annie was worried to death.  \"I was running around trying to find Max,\" she said. \"The lady who found him heard me calling and she brought him out to me.\"\nWhen the police arrived they saw quite clear drag marks --Max was rescued by the two dogs. \n      \"We felt so lucky, especially when so many kids in Australia drowned  every year. \" Said Paul. \n    The RSPCA awarded each dog a medallion,  a certificate  and a very large bone. \nTank and Muck, both were homeless before they were taken home by the Smiths.  It was a great leap , from rescued dogs to heroes.  Maybe it was just their way of saying thanks to the Smiths.", "id": "high20517.txt"}
