They were always getting into trouble and their parents knew that if any trouble occurred in their town their sons were probably involved.\nThe boys' mother heard that a clergyman in the town had been successful in educating children so she asked if he would speak with his boys. The clergyman agreed but asked to see them individually. So the mother sent her 8-year-old first in the morning with the elder boy to see the clergyman in the afternoon.\nThe clergyman, a huge man with a booming  voice, sat the younger boy down and asked him strictly, \"where is God?\"\nThe boy's mouth dropped open but he made no answer, sitting there with his mouth hanging open, wide-eyed. So the clergyman repeated the question in an even stricter tone  \"where is God?\" Again the boy made no attempt to answer. So the clergyman raised his voice even more and shook his finger in the boy's face and shouted \"where is God?\" \nThe boy screamed and escaped from the room, ran directly home and dove into his closet,  _ the door behind him. When his elder brother found him in the closet, he asked \"what happened?\"\nThe younger brother replied out of breath, \"We are in big trouble this time. God is missing, and they think we did it.\"", "id": "high23450.txt"}
