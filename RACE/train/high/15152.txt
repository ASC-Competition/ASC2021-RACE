Perez says, \"The seeds of success spring from failure's ashes. \"Failure is not defeat; it is the pointer to do better than what you just did.

To fail is to understand what not to do. Remember it and don't give up until your goal is achieved.\"\nWhat do you do when you face difficulty? Yeah, life is difficult, but you do not give up.\nHave a positive and calm outlook on your circumstances   and make the best of them. You may learn something new. You can develop mental toughness. Mental toughness means to be able to see the long-term gains rather than be put off by short-term pains.

You will regret when you see the consequences of not seizing the opportunities when they arose. Take chances every day!", "id": "high15152.txt"}
