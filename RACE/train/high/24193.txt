He looked at people sensibly enough but seemed unable to hear any questions put to him. An officer remarked to the captain, \"Those brass   plates on the steps of the bridge-ladder are very dangerous things. \"\n\"Are they?\" replied Captain Johns, \"It takes more than a brass plate to make an able-bodied man fall down in that way. And the weather fine, everything dry, and the ship going on a smooth sea!\"\nOn the fourth day, the chief officer looked better. He could hear and understand and could even speak in a weak voice. \n\"Well, Mr Bunter,\" said Captain Johns, \"Can you tell us what caused the accident!\"\nBunter moved his head slightly and fixed his cold blue stare on the Captain's eyes and said in a whisper, \"You--were--right!\"\n\"Bless my soul!\" cried out Captain Johns, \"Do you mean you had a supernatural experience that night? You saw a ghost on my ship?\"\nUnwillingness, shame, disgust   would have been seen on poor Bunter's face if a good part of it had not been wrapped in bandage   . He tried hard and answered, \"Yes, I have seen.\"\n\"And did it --did it knock you down from the ladder?\"\n\"Come! Am I the sort of man to be knocked down by a ghost?\"\nCaptain Johns pointed a finger at Bunter. \"You've been terrified, \" he said , \"That's what's the matter, even the man at the wheel was frightened, though he couldn't see anything. He felt the supernatural. You've been punished because you wouldn't believe, Mr Bunter. \"\n\"Suppose I have, \" said Bunter, \"You don't know what I saw. And I can't tell you what it was like. Every man has his own ghosts. I stepped back. I don't remember anything else. \"\n\"The man at the wheel said you went backwards as if something had hit you.\"\n\"It was a sort of inward blow, \" Bunter explained, \"Aren't you satisfied now that I believe?\"", "id": "high24193.txt"}
