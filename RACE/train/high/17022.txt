This boy has artistic skills that would be the envy of any serious painter and drawn comparisons(,) to Pablo Picasso, a child prodigy  who became one of the most recognized artists of the 20th century.\nIt all began on a family holiday to Cornwall on the southwest English coast when Kieron was five. Inspired by the beautiful view, he asked his parents for his first sketch-pad  . From that moment on, he became deeply interested. While supportive, Kieron's parents are careful not to push their son. He only paints when and what he wants.\nHe has a waiting list of hundreds and requests for his works have been flooding in. His father said a sale of Kieron's works held in November even drew a buyer from Japan. \"We had people driving down that night, there were people on the door waiting to come in the morning who had been standing outside, the phones were going mad as soon as the door opened at nine o'clock and within 14 minutes all the 16 pictures had gone, \" he said. \nAll this talent, money and high praise could so easily go to a young boy's head, but Kieron said his friends keep him grounded. \"Some of them want to be as good as me and some of them think. . . Umn, 'you are not too special'.\" he said. \nKieron's favourite painter is British artist Edward Seago and he has spent some of his earnings buying a work by his hero. The rest is being invested  by his parents until he reaches 25. Kieron's parents and his younger sister Billi-Jo don't see him as anything but a average seven-year-old boy who likes to tear around the house and who's mad about football. But for now, with so much still to learn, there's only one thing he wants to be when he grows up. He said, \"I think I'll be an artist.\"", "id": "high17022.txt"}
