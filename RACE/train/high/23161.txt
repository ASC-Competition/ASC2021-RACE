The sale of any cup or bottle of sweetened drink larger than 16 ounces would be forbidden under the first-in-the- nation plan.\nThe measure would not apply to diet sodas, fruit juices, zero-calorie Vitamin Waters, dairy-based drinks like milkshakes , or alcoholic drinks; it would not expand to drinks sold in grocery stores or convenience stores.\nStefan Friedman, spokesman for the New York City Beverage Association, criticized the city's plan, saying it turns focus away from the hard work that needs to be done on this front.\nKelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said he believes the ban would be effective. \"It is not right to put all the blame for obesity on sugar drinks, but they are strongly connected with this rise in obesity over the last 30 years.\" Dr. Farley, the health commissioner, said the city had seen higher obesity rates in neighborhoods where soda consumption was more common.\nCity officials said they believe it will finally prove popular and push governments around the U.S. to follow similar rules.\nMr. Bloomberg has introduced a series of rules in his term of office, including bans on smoking in restaurants and parks, a ban on trans fat  in restaurant food and a requirement for health inspection grades to be posted in restaurant windows.\nBecause of the measures, the mayor was laughed at as Nanny Bloomberg, by those who view the bans as threats  to personal freedom. But many of the measures adopted in New York have become models for other cities, including bans on smoking and trans fat, as well as the use of graphic advertising to fight smoking and soda consumption, and the demand that restaurants post calories contents next to prices.", "id": "high23161.txt"}
