But since dogs are so much more olfactory  than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have.\n'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen.\n'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present.\nWhy do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans.\nDolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor\n'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.'\nThe university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them.\nThe scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household.\nThe familiar human scent samples were taken from someone else from the house other than the handlers during the experiment, so that none of the scent donors were physically present.\nThe results showed that all five scents elicited a similar response in parts of the dogs' brains involved in detecting smells. Responses were significantly stronger for the scents of familiar humans, followed by that of familiar dogs.\nThe findings, which were published in the journal Behavioural Processes, showed that dogs reacted strongest to the scent of a familiar human even when they were not there.\nPets trained as help or therapy dogs showed greater brain activity than the other dogs in the test.\nResearchers say the findings could improve the way animals who assist wounded veterans or disabled people are selected.", "id": "high6400.txt"}
