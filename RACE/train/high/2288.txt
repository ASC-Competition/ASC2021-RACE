They build their homes about 4.6m above the river, an important feature   for the safety of the young. It is called the hoatzin.\nIn appearance, the birds of both sexes look very much alike with brown on the back and cream and red on the underside. The head is small, with a large set of feathers on the top, bright red eyes, and blue skin. Its nearest relatives are the common birds, cuckoos. Its most striking feature, though, is only found in the young.\nBaby hoatzins have a claw on the leading edge of each wing and another at the end of each wing tip. Using these four claws, together with the beak  , they can climb about in the bushes, looking very much like primitive birds must have done. When the young hoatzins have learned to fly, they lose their claws.\nDuring the drier months between December and March hoatzins fly about the forest in groups of 20 to 30 birds, but in April, when the rainy season begins, they collect together in smaller living units of two to seven birds for producing purposes.", "id": "high2288.txt"}
