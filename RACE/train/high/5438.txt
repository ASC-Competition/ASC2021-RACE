I happened to see her outside on a -30 degree morning walking a dog. I felt sorry for Mary, out there walking a dog that's not hers in such cold weather. I thought maybe she was saying to herself, \"Yeah, this is why I don't have any pets! I hate walking dogs.\"\nLater that day I saw Mary and said, \"I saw you out there walking a dog this morning. Are you unhappy because you had to walk it on such a cold day?\" To my surprise, she said that she enjoyed getting out there and walking the dog and that she got good exercise because of the dog. She also said she had talked to her brother, the dog's owner, who was on holiday in Orlando, Florida with his family. He said his children were enjoying Disney World and the resorts  . His four-year-old son had breakfast with Mickey Mouse and said it was the best day in his life. Mary said, \"If I can help my brother and his family have a wonderful time relaxing for a week, knowing that their pet is being loved and cared for, what more could I ask for?\" She added, \"It's worth it for me to make the sacrifice   so that they can go and have fun.\"\nI learned a lesson from Mary.", "id": "high5438.txt"}
