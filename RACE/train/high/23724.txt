He said \"Any man who can tell me two lies which can satisfy me can marry my daughter.\" So all the liars in the countryside came to his house. But he said to all of them, \"I am not satisfied with your lies. I would not give my daughter to any of you. One day, however, a young man came and said, \"It will be very hot in summer, so you should go out now and dig a big hole under the street. Then when the hot summer weather comes you will sell the cool air from the hole and get a lot of money.\" Oh, that's a wonderful lie,\" answered the old man. \"What's the next one?\" The young man took out an old paper from his pocket, and said, \"Your father borrowed one million from me before he died. He gave this paper to prove that he owed me the money. I didn't ask him to pay that to me.\" Now the old man did not know what to do. \"If I say it's a lie, I must give my daughter, but if I say it's not a lie, I must pay him all the money.\" He said to himself. In the end he said, It's a lie.\" And the young man married his daughter.", "id": "high23724.txt"}
