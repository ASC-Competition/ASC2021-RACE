A college counselor tells you not to lock into plans? What's that all about? Actually, Nancy isn't the only counselor advising students to take their time in discovering who they are and what they want to do when they get out of college.\n\"Preparing broadly makes sense to me,\"she explains,\"that the best preparation for a future that's still unfolding is a broad preparation. It shouldn't prevent you from following areas that light you up, but a broad preparation will prepare you for multiple careers. That's important because jobs change more frequently due to changes in technology and business competition. Some jobs that are available today may be on their way out in 10 years. The best thing about preparing broadly is that you get to live in a big world. You avoid getting typecast in a job or business area, and if your job becomes out of date, you can move on.\"\nStudents let the\"next-step mind\"interfere with their learning as well. Many students don't take courses outside their comfort zone for fear it will ruin their GPA (grade point average) and their chances of getting into a certain college.\"You may be reluctant to go outside your areas of strength for fear you'll get a low grade,\"says Nancy.\"But if you think one grade in one class will ruin your chances of admission, you're doing yourself a disservice. Colleges look at a number of factors in addition to grades. Students often think of requirements for colleges as much tighter and narrower than they really are.\"\nSince colleges work to admit a diverse group of students, the best thing to do is be yourself and explore your options.\"I know of many people in their late 20s who are unhappy in their careers and who regret that they didn't pursue a wider range of interests while in college.\"\nHer advice to students:\"Think about who you are right now. You have certain preferences. You have areas you like to study. You have certain skills.\"She suggests using interest surveys to help you gain a sense of where your interests and skills can lead you.\n\"Follow your nose and find a college that will support and encourage you academically and socially. Have faith in yourself and the things you like to do,\"she adds.", "id": "high19570.txt"}
