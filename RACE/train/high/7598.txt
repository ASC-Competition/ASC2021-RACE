It came from a neighboring state, where the family's only surviving relative lived. It was Sally's relative -- a distant relative by the name of Tilbury Foster, seventy and single. Tilbury now wrote to Sally, saying he should shortly die, and should leave him thirty thousand dollars, cash; not for love, but because money had given him most of his troubles, and he wished to place it where there was good hope that it would continue its evil work. The _ would be found in his will, and would be officially handed over provided that Sally should be able to prove to the executors  .\nAs soon as Aleck had partially recovered from the strong emotions created by the letter, she sent someone to the relative's home and subscribed for the local paper.\nFor the rest of the day Sally made confusion with his books, and Aleck could not keep her mind on her affairs, not even take up a flower-pot or book or a stick of wood without forgetting what she had intended to do with it. For both were dreaming.\n\"Thirty thousand dollars!\"\nAll day long Aleck was absorbed in planning how to invest it, Sally in planning how to spend it.\nThere was no romance-reading that night. The children took themselves away early, for their parents were silent, disturbed, and strangely unentertaining. Two pencils had been busy during that hour -- note-making; in the way of plans. It was Sally who broke the stillness at last. He said, with excitement, \"Ah, it'll be grand, Aleck! Out of the first thousand we'll have a horse and a buggy for summer, and a cutter and a skin lap-robe for winter.\"\nAleck responded with decision and calmness.\n\"You can spend a part of it. But the whole of the capital must be put right to work.\n\"Why, yes. Yes, of course. Have you got it invested yet?\"\n\"No, there's no hurry about that; I must look around first, and think, er..., I've turned it over twice; once in oil and once in wheat.\"\n\"Why, Aleck, it's splendid! What does it amount to?\"\n\"I think -- well, to be on the safe side, about a hundred and eighty thousand clear, though it will probably be more.\"\n\"My! Isn't it wonderful? Good heaven! Luck has come our way at last, Aleck!\"\nThen they went up to bed, but they left the candle burning in the sitting room. They did not remember until they were undressed; then Sally was for letting it burn; he said they could afford it, if it was a thousand. But Aleck went down and put it out.\nA good job, too; for on her way back she hit on a scheme that would turn the hundred and eighty thousand into half a million before it had had time to get cold.", "id": "high7598.txt"}
