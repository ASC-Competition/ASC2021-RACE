Organize a blank drive for your local homeless, and ask around for donations!\nPractice random acts of kindness\nI'll never forget the time when I went to pay for my Dr. Pepper, but the sever resisted, saying my bill was paid by an anonymous  guest. It's this random act of kindness that restores my faith in humanity. Bless someone by paying for their drink at Starbucks, or praising them! If you live somewhere where it snows, shovel your neighbour's snow out of their driveway for them! Whether it is as simple as praise or as complex as paying the bill, you'll never know how far your impact will reach.\nSay thank you\nJust a simple thank-you can _ , especially if they feel like their work is never noticed. Cultivate  a smile on their face by being sincere and grateful for all that they do.\nUse your talents to help the community\nThe best way to show your appreciation for people is by using the talents and skills you have to bless others. For me, I love to coordinate  events and write , and so my way of reaching out to the community is through writing articles and creating awareness about problems we face today. If you can bake, make some delicious cookies for people to enjoy! If you can knit, put your talents to use by making clothes for children in foster care. Any talent can be used to help the community in meaningful ways.\nWish you a happy, healthy and helpful holiday season.", "id": "high8152.txt"}
