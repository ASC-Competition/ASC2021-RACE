It is held in order to help all those who are 20 or over realize that they have become independent members of society.\n Coming of age ceremonies have been held since the ancient times in Japan. In the past, boys marked their change to adulthood when they were around 15, and girls celebrated their coming of age when they turned 13 or so. It wasn't until 1876 that 20 became the legal age of adulthood.\nThese days, many women choose to wear traditional clothing---a kind of kimono  with special designs. For unmarried women, this type of kimono is the most formal thing they can wear. However, such a full set of formal clothing is expensive, so it is usually either passed down or rented rather than being bought specially for the occasion. Men may also wear traditional clothing.\nLocal city governments host special coming of age ceremonies for 20-year-olds. They gain the right to vote on their twentieth birthday and have new responsibilities as well. So the age of 20 is a big turning point for the Japanese. All young adults who turned or will turn 20 between April 1 of the previous year and March 31 of the current one and who maintain residency  in the area are invited to attend. Government officials give speeches, and small presents are handed out to the new adults during the ceremonies.\nAfter the ceremonies, the young adults often gather in groups and go to parties.", "id": "high17416.txt"}
