I was a bit nervous, but I knew some of our friends were already into it, and they said it was fine and that I should relax because everyone was doing it.\"OK,\" I agreed, convinced it would be harmless.\n _ B _ \nBefore long, we were using it once a week. Then it became twice a week. We went from using it after work to using it in the mornings, and then at lunchtime, too.\nSuddenly we reached a point where we were using it every day. Even when I wasn't using it, I was thinking about using it.  _ C _ \nThat's when I realized the terrible truth. We couldn't stop.\nDear readers, it shames me to admit it, but I am an addict of online shopping site Taobao.\nAnd I don't think I'm the only one.  _ D _ \nI see the telltale signs every where: People with bags under their eyes, clearly exhausted after staying up late browsing items they might one day need (but probably won't),like the 1940s leather aviator cap I bought in the event I ever need to become an aviator in the 1940s.

Resist buying adult-sized, Star Wars Stormtrooper outfit on Taobao. You don't really need it.\nStep two: Try not to feel guilty about buying adult-sized, Star Wars Stormtrooper outfit on Taobao.\nStep three: Put the computer and smartphone away, get back to nature, and take a walk in the park.\nStep four: Try not to feel guilty about buying a new outfit for your walk in the park. I mean, it was  on sale, right?\nStep five: Buying a book on how to quit Taobao...from Taobao.\nOn second thoughts, maybe don't listen to me, after all.", "id": "high19253.txt"}
