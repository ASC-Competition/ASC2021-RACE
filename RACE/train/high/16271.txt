It is something far less pleasant, like being called in your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you did not do this or that. Terrible music, indeed, but it has to be faced. At some time or another, every one of us has had to \"face the music\", especially as children. We can remember father's angry voice: \"I want to talk to you!\" And only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was!\nThe phrase \"face the music\" is known to every American, old and young. It is at least one hundred years old. Where did the expression come from?\nThe first explanation came from the American novelist James Fenimore Cooper. He said, in 1851, that expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings   to go on stage. After they got their clue  to go on , they often said, \"It's time to go to face the music.\" And that is exactly what they did face the orchestra   which was just below the stage.

So \"face the music\" came to mean: having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice.", "id": "high16271.txt"}
