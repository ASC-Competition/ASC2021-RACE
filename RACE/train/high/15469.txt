Driven by the hatred of slavery, she found time to write Uncle Tom's Cabin, which became the most influential novel in American history and caused great change, both at home and abroad.\nToday, however, the book has a different reputation, owing to the popular image of its character, Uncle Tom, whose name has become a saying for a cowardly black man who betrays his race.\nBut this view is wrong: the original Uncle Tom was physically and morally strong, an inspiration for black people and other oppressed people worldwide. Indeed, that was why, in the mid-19th century, Southerners attacked Uncle Tom's Cabin as a dangerously destructive book, while Northern reformers--especially black people--often praised it.\nThe book was influential overseas too. In Russia it inspired Vladimir Lenin, who recalled it as his favorite book in childhood. It was the first American novel to be translated and published in China, and it fueled anti-slavery movements in Cuba and Brazil.\nThe book's progressive appeal was the character of Uncle Tom himself: a strong man who is notable because he does not betray his race; one reason he gives up escaping from his plantation is that he doesn't want to put his fellow slaves in danger. And he is finally killed because he refuses to tell his master where two runaway slaves are hiding.\nUnfortunately, these themes were lost in many of the stage versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin.\nThe play, seen by more people than those who read the book, remained popular up to the 1950s and still appears occasionally. But in the play, Stowe's revolutionary themes were drowned.\nBut it doesn't have to be that way; indeed; during the civil rights era it was those who most closely resembled Uncle Tom--Stowe's Uncle Tom, not the embarrassed one of popular myth--that proved most effective in promoting progress. Both Stowe and Uncle Tom deserve our reconsideration and our respect.", "id": "high15469.txt"}
