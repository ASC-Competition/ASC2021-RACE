Some of these people made a great impact on my life, my views and personal philosophy. Others I met had the opposite effect because they represented attitudes, behavior and beliefs that were directly opposed to my views on life and my feelings about the value of all people.\nOne such person I met was a woman in her late seventies. She had been an active woman, raised a family and had engaged in helping others, and developed her own crafts to sell at selected craft shows throughout the year.\nWhen I met her for the first time, I couldn't believe that she was in her late seventies -- I would have placed her age more in her early sixties. After speaking with her for a short period, it was only then that the conversation seemed to turn to age. And, it wasn't a conversation about thefrailty  of age, or the aches and pains, or about pleasures lost.\nThe conversation, instead, focused on her _ for life and all the things that she was in the planning stages of doing. And, what she was planning to do wasn't about going to a seniors group so she and her husband could go on a bus tour. What she was planning was an excursion  to Europe, unaccompanied by any tour operator or taken around the usual sights by a local guide.\nShe really impressed me a lot because of her zest for life; for an uncompromising view of the future not in the least affected by her age; for the undying faith in knowing that there was a great deal of life yet to be discovered and experienced and yearning for each new image, discussion, smell, cultural uniqueness or experience.", "id": "high444.txt"}
