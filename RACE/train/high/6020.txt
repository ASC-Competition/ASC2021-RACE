Does that number surprise you? These students already know the benefits of studying abroad. You may be wondering why you should study abroad. Here are some answers for you.\n* Timing\nThe absolutely best time in your life to study abroad is when you are in college. If you miss this opportunity, it's almost impossible for you to do it later in life.\n* To gain cross-cultural experience\nLife overseas makes you see your everyday world in a whole new light. You don't even realize it, but our culture shapes the way we view the world and affects us every minute of the day. Differences in culture are more than just differences in language, food, clothing and art.\n* To improve your communication skills and your self-confidence\nPeople who study abroad tend to be willing to take risks, willing to put themselves in unusual situations, and able to solve problems.\n* To become more fluent in a language or to learn a new language\nThe world market is becoming smaller, and many companies require a second language. Foreign languages are not only valuable in the job market but also valuable in the real world.\n* For the adventure\nTravel to other cities within your host country and around neighboring countries. As you get to know your new classmates, roommates, and host family, you will gain a unique view on the host culture. Discover the differences and, more importantly, the many similarities between your worlds. The friendships you make will last long after the program.\n* To learn more about yourself\nFind out who you really are. What are your limits? How do you overcome the difficulties you've never _ before? How independent are you? These questions are hard to answer until you are removed from your usual surroundings. After solving difficult problems on your own overseas, you'll find that almost nothing will confuse you at home. Students who study abroad commonly report that their study abroad experience actually changed their lives.", "id": "high6020.txt"}
