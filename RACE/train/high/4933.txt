They once faced the same thing: their mother gave them apples when they were young.\nThe criminal said: one day, my mother brought some apples and asked my brother and me: \"Which do you want?\" \"The reddest and biggest one,\" my little brother said. My mother stared at him and said to him angrily: \"You should learn to give the good things to others; you shouldn't always think of yourself.\" Seeing this, I suddenly changed my idea and then said to my mother: \"Mum, please give me the smaller one and give the bigger one to my little brother.\" Hearing my words, my mother was very happy. She kissed me on my face and gave the reddest and biggest apple to me as a prize. From then on, I learned to tell lies, fight, steal and rob. In order to get what I wanted, I played hard. As a result, I was sent into prison.\nThe famous man from the White House said: One day, my mother brought some apples. She said to my brother and me: \"You all want the reddest and biggest one, right? Well, let's have a competition. Now I divide the grassland in front of the gate into two and I will give one to each of you and you must shear  it well. And I will give the reddest and biggest apple to him who does it the most quickly and best.\"\nAfter the competition, I won and I got the biggest apple. In our family, as long as you want to get the best things, you must take part in competition. I think it is fair. No matter what you want, you must pay lots of efforts.", "id": "high4933.txt"}
