Often you are harder on yourself than you are of other people. If you can learn to accept yourself just the way you are, especially unconditionally, this would reduce the pressure you apply to yourself.\nExercise\nGo for a walk. Go to the shops. You can join a local walk, swim or jog team. If you are tired out from doing housework and haven`t left your workstation, have a stretch. Change your environment for an hour or so.\nStop Comparing Yourself with Others\nOften you don`t realize that a great deal of unhappiness is caused by constant comparisons you make.

The only comparison that counts is the comparison between where you were and where you are now . By all means, admire others, congratulate them and be proud of their achievements, but remind yourself that only you can decide the standard  you want to set for yourself.\nTalk the Stress Out\nSometimes it helps to share or talk about your stress to close friends or family members.
