Fox's unbelievable successful contest crashed the Olympics in head-to-head competition on Tuesday night, 27 million viewers to 16.1 million, according to Nielsen Media Research.\nThe Olympics recovered a bit after \"Idol\" went off the air, but its overall audience of 18.6 million was the least-watched winter Olympics telecast since Nagano's closing ceremonies in 1998, Nielsen said.\nSince its opening on Friday, the Turin games have been running well below the 2002 Salt Lake City games in viewership interest.

NBC said before the games started that it had promised its advertisers a rating of between 12 and 14. If it slips below that, NBC will have to make it up to advertisers with free commercial time.\n\" 'American Idol' is clearly a phenomenon,\" said Randy Falco, president of the NBC Universal Television Group. \"But we expected it and are tracking fight where we planned to be at this point.\" Between NBC and its networks, about 65 percent of the nation's television homes have tuned in at least some of the games.", "id": "high544.txt"}
