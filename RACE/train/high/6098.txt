Anxious? Is your mind racing in circles? Are you worried about all the things you have to get done? Here's a quick--acting trick that can make you feel better.\nIf you are sitting at a desk, place the palm of your hand on the desk, and take a moment to focus on what the surface of the desk feels like. Is it hot or cold, rough or smooth? Put all of your attention on the sensations in your palm, on how the desk feels underneath your hand. If you are not at a desk, do the same exercise by placing your palm on any nearby object--a wall, a chair, even your opposite arm.\nWhen you are feeling stressed, your thoughts tend to take on a life of their own.

Paying attention to what objects in your environment feel like forces you to pay more attention to the present moment than to negative, anxiety--provoking (,)thoughts about the past or about the future.\nTry using your other senses too:\nTry closing your eyes for a second(don't try this while driving!) and breathe deeply through your nose. What do you smell?\nWhen eating, put all your attention on how your food tastes.\nWhat do you hear? What little noises are there around you that you didn't notice before?\nLook closely at an ordinary object. Do you see anything you haven't noticed before?", "id": "high6098.txt"}
