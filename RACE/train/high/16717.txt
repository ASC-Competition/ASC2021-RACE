Let's get a new pet to get along with it,\"Mrs Brown said to her husband.     \n\"That sounds like a pretty good idea,\"he answered.\"Do you want to see the ads in the newspaper?\"     \n\"Let's go to the animal shelter. Many pets there need homes. Since tomorrow is Saturday,we can both go,\" she said. Next morning the Browns met Mr Snow at the animal shelter. \"We want to be sure that the pets here go to good homes,\" Mr Snow said,\"So I need to ask you some questions.\" After they talked for a while, the Browns decided to get a small dog. It wouldn't need a big house or a big yard. A small dog would bark  and warn them if someone tried to break into their house. After Mr Snow gave the Browns a book on pet care, they chose one and wanted to take her home right away. But the animal doctor hadn't checked her yet. So Mr Snow told them to return on Sunday. On Sunday afternoon the Browns went to the animal shelter. The animal doctor said,\"Shadow has had all of her shots .  She will be healthy.\"The Browns thanked the doctor and took Shadow home.    \n *,.", "id": "high16717.txt"}
