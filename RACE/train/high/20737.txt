But in the earthquake capitals of the world - Japan, Los Angeles, Turkey - rats will soon be man's new best friends.\nWhat happens after an earthquake? We send in rescue dogs. Why? Because they can smell people. Dogs save lives. They help rescuers to find living people. But dogs are big and they can't get into small spaces. So now a new research project is using a smaller animal to save lives: the rat.\nHow does it work? First, the rat is trained to smell people. When this happens, the rat's brain gives a signal .This is sent to a small radio on its back, and then the rescuers follow the radio signals. When rat's brain activity jumps, the rescuers know that someone is alive. The rat has smelled that person.\nAlthough there are already robots which can do this job, rats are better. Christian Linster at Cornell University, New York, says, \"Robots' noses don't work well when there are other smells around. Rats are good at that. \" Rats can also see in the dark. They are cheaper and quicker to train than dogs, and unlike robots, they don't need electricity!\nThe \"rat project\" is not finished, but Julie Ryan of International Rescue Corps in Scotland says, \"It would be fantastic. A rat could get into spaces we couldn't get to, and a rat would get out if it wasn't safe.\" Perhaps for the first time in history, people will be happy to see a rat in a building(but only after an earthquake, of course.)", "id": "high20737.txt"}
