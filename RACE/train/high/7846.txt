And I'm pleased about that.\nToday, more and more schools are reaching out to involve parents, community members and businesses to help shape a child's future.\nParents need to be involved in their children's education in many ways. Helping children with homework and studying, going on a field trip, teaching a craft or coaching a child's sports team are all great ways to be involved with your child's education. And don't forget to communicate with teachers ---- they need and respect your input. Studies show that children learn more and schools function better when parents and schools work together. It's important to stay in touch with your child's education all through his or her school career.\nCommunities can help children create and achieve new goals. Help with homework, read to a child, coach a children's team, or provide emotional support. Help solve problems and build self-esteem . Kids need role models and advisers can be role models by sharing their experiences and wisdom.\nBusinesses can also help shape our children's future. Invite a class from your local school to visit your workplace. You may be providing a glimpse that opens a new world of possibilities. Show students what goes on during a typical day. Give a mini course for students: how to use a computer; how products are made; how machinery works. You may have a developing electrician, teacher, nurse, or even a newspaper reporter on your hands.\nIt really does take an entire village to raise a child.So share the responsibility -- and the joy -- of bringing a child to his or her full potential .", "id": "high7846.txt"}
