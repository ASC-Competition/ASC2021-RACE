She was not going to accept any kind of instructions from me. In the interest of not getting myself killed,I started to read and educate myself on ways to manage a high-spirited horse.\nI discovered natural horsemanship ,a method of training that focuses on communication.In order to communicate with another person,you must be understood.The very definition of understanding is two or more persons share the same idea. This simple definition had a big influence on me.I realized that communication is a two-way street!\nWhen I started to adopt horsemanship in my life,I noticed a change in the way other people related to me.My husband,when I stopped ordering him around,became happier and more helpful.My children,when I practiced being fair,firm and most of all,considerate,were motivated to act sooner,at a polite request instead of the orders from me.\nI think the most valuable life skill I learned from my horse is that pressure motivates. As soon as I applied these basic skills to my daily activities, I started to notice positive changes. My children were more considerate of each other.and started to ask first,without telling.I became aware of my position as a role model.\nToday,five years later,I have the perfect horse.I also have very polite kids and a very happy husband.There's nothing in the world that can compare to being loved by ones you love most---even if it all started with the attitude of a very special horse.", "id": "high7019.txt"}
