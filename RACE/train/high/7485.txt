After passengers were trapped in the train for more than four hours because fallen power line poles made access for emergency workers difficult.\nAuthorities reported up to 80 injuries. Thirteen people were taken to hospital in a\" _ or serious condition.\"\nBetween 180 and 200 passengers were on the 5:15pm Virgin service from London Euston to Glasgow Central when all nine carriages left the rails between Oxenholme and Tebay. Witnesses said that the train shook violently before toppling  over into an embankment with at least four carriages overturning. Early this morning, authorities confirmed an elderly woman had died and some other passengers had suffered injuries including back strains, head wounds and broken bones.\nRuth Colton, a passenger on the train, said she was reading a book when the journey became uncomfortable. It seemed that the train was being beaten by heavy winds,\"as if we were on a plane\".\nThe accident brought concerns that Britain's busiest rail route would be crippled for some time. The line between Preston and Carlisle was postponed as Virgin Trains promised a rapid investigation into the \"serious incident\"--the company's first big crash.\nIt is understood that the investigation will examine whether there was an obstacle on the track and the possibility of speeding or mechanical breakdown. The driver, who was injured, will be interviewed and a black-box recorder installed in the train will be examined.", "id": "high7485.txt"}
