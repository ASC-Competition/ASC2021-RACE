As she once said of herself: \"I would never sit back in a rocking chair, waiting for someone to help me.\" No one could have had a more productive old age.\nShe was born Anna Mary Robertson on a farm in New York State, one of five boys and five girls. At twelve she left home and was in domestic  service until, at twenty-seven, she married Thomas Moses, the hired hand of one of her employers. They farmed most of their lives, first in Virginia and then in New York State, at Eagle Bridge. She had ten children, of whom five\n; her husband died in 1927.\nGrandma Moses painted a little as a child and made embroidery  pictures as a hobby, but only changed to oils in old age because her hands had become too stiff  to sew and she wanted to keep busy and pass the time. Her pictures were first sold at a local market and were soon noticed by a businessman who bought everything she painted. Three of the pictures exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art, and in 1940 she had her first exhibition in New York. Between the 1930s and her death she produced some 2,000 pictures: detailed and lively portrayals  of the country life she had known for so long, with a wonderful sense of colour and form. \"I think really hard till I think of something really pretty, and then I paint it.\" she said.", "id": "high16261.txt"}
