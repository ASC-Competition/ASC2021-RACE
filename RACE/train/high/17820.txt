Many girls she knew seemed to worry too much about their appearance -- their weight, skin, hair, even the shape of their faces.\nSo Julia decided to do something about it. Her target? Seventeen, a popular girls' magazine. \"I look at the pictures, and they just don't look like girls I see walking down the street,\" the eighth-grader from Maine told The New York Times.\nOf course they don't. Magazines use programs like Photoshop to remove zits , add shine to hair, and slim waistlines. Often, girls are made to look like Barbie dolls.\nJulia fears that these impossible standards of beauty make teens feel terrible about their own appearances. After all, even the models aren't as perfect as they look in print!\nSo Julia launched an online petition  asking Seventeen to put at least one unaltered photo in each issue. \"I want to see regular girls that look like me in a magazine that's supposed to be for me,\" she wrote.\nDays later, her petition had thousands of signatures. Julia and her mom traveled to New York City and joined a demonstration  in front of Seventeen' s offices. Then they were invited to meet with Seventeen's editor-in-chief, Ann Shoket.\nA few months later, Shoket announced that the staff of Seventeen had signed a \"Body Peace Treaty.\" They promised to \"never change girls' body or face shapes\" and only use photos of \"real girls and models who are healthy.\" In addition, they promised to be more open about the ways in which images are changed before publication.\nJulia's fight against teen self-hate is far from over, but for now it seems she's winning -- and she's thrilled. \"This is a huge victory,\" she wrote in a message on her petition page. \"I'm so unbelievably happy.\"", "id": "high17820.txt"}
