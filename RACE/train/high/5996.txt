All day Andrew felt worried --- what if Mr. Larchmont refuses to grant his request? Andrew had worked so hard and of course, he deserves a wage increase.\nThe thought of walking into Larchmont's office left Andrew weak in the knees. Late in the afternoon he finally _ up the courage to approach his superior. To his delight and surprise, the ever-frugal Harvey Larchmont agreed to give him a raise!\nAndrew arrived home to a beautiful table set with their best china, and candles lit. His wife, Tina had prepared a fine meal including his favorite dishes. Immediately he figured someone from the office might have broken the good news to her!\nNext to his plate Andrew found a lettered note, reading: \"Congratulations, my love! I knew you'd get the raise! I prepared this dinner to show just how much I love you. I am so proud of your accomplishments!\" He read it and stopped to reflect on how sensitive and caring Tina was.\nAfter dinner, Andrew was on his way to the kitchen when he observed a second card had slipped out of Tina's pocket onto the floor. He picked it up. He read: \"Don't worry about not getting the raise! You deserve it anyway! You are a wonderful provider and I prepared this dinner to show you just how much I love you even though you did not get the increase.\"\nSuddenly tears swelled in Andrew's eyes. Total acceptance! Tina's support for him was not conditional upon his success at work.\nThe fear of rejection is often softened when we know someone loves us regardless of our success or failure.", "id": "high5996.txt"}
