Suddenly from the shadow of a dark building a tall man with a sharp knife in his right hand ran out at her. \"Good morning, lady,\" the man said in a low voice, \"I don't think you wish to die here!\"\n\"What do you want?\" Agatha asked.\n\"Your earrings . Take them off!\"\nAgatha suddenly had a bright idea. She tried to cover her necklace with the collar ( ) of her overcoat while she used the other hand to take off both of her earrings and then she quickly threw them on the ground.\n\"Take them and let me go,\" she said. The robber saw that the girl didn't care for the earrings at all, only trying to protect the necklace. He thought the necklace would cost more, so he said, \"Give me your necklace.\"\n\"Oh, sir. It's not worth much. Please let me keep it.\"\n\"Stopping rubbish . Quick!\"\nWith shaky hands, Agatha took off her necklace. As soon as the robber disappeared, she picked up her earrings and ran as fast as she could to one of her friends.\nThe earrings cost 480 pounds and the necklace the robber had taken away cost only six pounds.", "id": "high216.txt"}
