The toads failed in that duty but spread across prefix = st1 /Queenslandand into neighboring northern area.\nNow it calmly invades the states of Western Australia and New South Wales (NSW). NSW wildlife experts fear  _ --which have poisonous backs that kill hungry predators, --will have a terrible effect on native animals.\nThose fears may be about to be realized. Australia's leading government research body, the  Commonwealth Science and Industry Research organization (CSIRO), forecasts a rise in average temperatures that will make NSW ideal living place for the cane toad.\nTony Robinson, head of CSIRO's Wildlife,Pests,and Diseases Program, said climate change is increasing the amount of suitable living place for the toad.\n\"With climate change, the cane toads might go down as far as Sydney and some areas of Western Australia,\" Robinson said.\nRecent estimates put the pace of the toad's westward march at nearly 17 miles(27 kilometers)a year and slightly slower from north to south.\nMore southerly cities, such as Melbourne and Adelaide, would likely remain too cold and dry to ever suit the toads, Robinson noted, but Perthcould expect cane toads in five years' time.\nSydney could see their arrival in the next 20 years.\nRobinson said there is no 0ne method that will keep the toads under control.\nThe cane toads already cover at least half of Queenslandand most of the northern country the toads are believed to number in the billions.\nA Venezuelan virus was tried in the 1990s but had to be given up after it was found to also kill native frog species.\nScientists and governmental bodies believe a national approach is needed.\nThe main threat the toads cause to species such as dingos, quolls, goannas, and crocodiles is the poison contained in glands   on each of the frogs' shoulders. The poison sprays out when the toads are threatened or handled roughly.\nThe poison is made up of 14 different chemicals. Together they cause rapid heartbeats, excessive salivation, convulsions, and paralysis.\nCane toads also compete, and usually win, the hunt for food and living space.\n\"If the government and other states combine resources, I believe we can achieve a very practical biological -control research program, \"Burns said.", "id": "high22347.txt"}
