These people were asked if the objects could be found inside the house, or outdoors.Then some of the subjects were given a caffeine pill.The others were given a placebo--a pill containing nothing. 24 hours later,the subjects were shown the exact same images from the day before.They were also shown images with slight differences,and some completely new images. Both groups correctly identified the exact same and completely new pictures.But those who took the caffeine pill were better at spottingthe pictures that were slightly different.\nProfessor Yassa says their answers helped to show the effects of caffeine on memory. And  we find that if they are on caffeine they are much more likely to make the right decision.\"\nThe amount of caffeine the researchers used in the study was similar to one cup of strong coffee.The researchers did not see any improvement to memory from smaller doses of caffeine or when it was given an hour before viewing the images.", "id": "high6781.txt"}
