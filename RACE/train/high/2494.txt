Started at first in the United States and brought to Britain in 1994, Take Our Daughters to Work Day has become a special day for girls between 11 and 15. On that day thousands of girls take a day off school and go together with one of their parents to their work places. The purpose of this day is to broaden girls' horizons and raise their self-confidence.\nFor many years people have thought that boys can do better than girls in society. But actually, \"girls can be whatever they want to be just like boys, whether it is a pilot, a nurse or a chief executive .\"says the chairman of the Our Sons and Daughters Charitable Trust, an organization which supported the activity of the Day. \"Now the girls have a close look at what their parents are doing and this may help them to be more self-confident when they are faced with a choice of work.\"\nSchools and many companies support the activity too. Palmers Green High School for girls in north of London, has made the day a necessary part of careers education.\nZarina Bart, 15, from Palmers Green, went with her mother Gwen to her Lawyer's office this year's Take Our Daughters to Work Day. \"I learned how to fill in a legal aid form and I read details of a case. Then I went to see the actual trial.\" she said.\nZarina found it interesting to see her mother at work. \"It's really strange seeing Mum at work--running around, getting serious and telling people what to do.\" She has always liked this idea of going into law and thinks it likely that she will follow in her mother's footsteps. Having a chance to see how her mother works has given her more self-confidence.\nExperts believe that girls with higher self-confidence aim higher and are more likely to be successful in life. Parents have important effect on the confidence of teenage girls. If parents believe in their daughters and show examples both at work as well as at home for them, this will give a lot of help to girls. Take Our Daughters to Work Day is surely a step in the right direction.", "id": "high2494.txt"}
