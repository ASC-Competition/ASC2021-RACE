The couple are inprefix = st1 /Englandto visit friends and family before heading back toTanzaniafor their next film. Their work takes them to some of the world's least-known areas but they still find themselves drawn back toEngland, particularly toCornwall, where their work and personal relationship developed.\n\"We met in London when Mark was studying biology and I was at the Royal College of Art studying photography,\" says Victoria. \"We both learned to dive at the same pool inLondonand went on diving weekends in the country. It was a terrible place, freezing cold, where we dived in wet suits full of holes. But that is where our relationship developed.\"\nAfter completing their studies they took part in the management of a conservation area in the mouth of the River Fal in Cornwall. \"We were shocked. Nobody seemed to understand the river's ecological importance. So we thought, why don't we make a film to show people what a special place it is? Neither of us had any experience of filming but we took part-time jobs until we had enough cash to buy an underwater camera and some film.\" A television company agreed to provide money for the work and the film they produced about the underwater life of the River Fal was shown on television and won a number of prizes.\nBy then, they both knew they wanted to work with wildlife in distant places around the world. Alkan Root, a famous East African wildlife film-maker, asked them to work for him. That was seven years ago and the job took them to the Serengeti to film crocodiles. Their films, Here Be Dragons andDevil Fish, were very successful.\n\"We love Africa but we have to come back to Englandevery year,\" saysVictoria. \"We need to return to see our friends and family. For us, Africa is temporary andEnglandmeans permanence. It's the difference between living in a tent inTanzaniaand a house inCornwall. We are lucky... we have the best of both worlds.\"", "id": "high17505.txt"}
