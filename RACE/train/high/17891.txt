Well, someone decided to tell the press, and all hell has broken loose.\"\n\"But we really do need cockroaches.\"\n\"One might be forgiven for never considering how to catch a live cockroach. But it's simple enough to fool them,\" Greig said, \"and even easier to catch them.\" American cockroaches are the most common kind in Texas, measuring up to 2 inches long and invading homes.\nDespite their less-than-attractive reputation, cockroaches actually aren't that dirty. Greig even went so far as to call them \"fastidious\" saying they don't enjoy rooting  in waste. They're only dirty if, say, they used a sewer line to gain access into a home.\nThe roaches collected by the museum will become part of a display in a new exhibit that showcases insects such as cockroaches, dung beetles and termites.\nThere's more to like about roaches, too. They don't bite, and they don't carry diseases like a mosquito, so they're generally safe to handle.", "id": "high17891.txt"}
