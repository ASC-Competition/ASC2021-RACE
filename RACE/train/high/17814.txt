I went to the local dealer. \"Oh, you want a Civic, do you?\" said the fellow. \"And I suppose you'd also like us to throw in a couple of front-row Superbowl tickets? Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!\"\nWhen his laughter ended, he explained that the Civic was such a hit in Europe that Honda was getting an extra $ 2,000 per car there, making Civic practically unavailable in the States. But he did offer to let me add my name to the waiting list--if I agreed to pay $1,000 over the sticker   price.\nWhen Honda dealerships No. 2 and No. 3 gave me the same story, I was ready to try anything. I carefully looked over to www.autobytel.com. For a  _ like me, Auto-By-Tel's scheme   is nearly irresistible. You indicate the car you want to buy, compete with the freedom to choose. The nearest participating car dealer mails you back with a cut rate offer. There's no charge for any of this -- and no obligation to accept the offer. It surely seemed no less to me.\nSure enough, two days later, a dealer 30 minutes away wrote me. \"Unfortunately, 96 Civics are in very short supply,\" his message said, \"The best we can offer you is $1,200 under sticker price. \"I was in happiness. Ah! Bliss! Ah, saving! Ah, revenge!\nWhen I picked up the car, it got better. Since there was no haggling  , the dealership fellow was friendly and congratulatory instead of everything. Now this, I thought, is the way to buy a car. \n     Auto-By-Tel makes money by charging a fee to each participating dealer. The dealers make money by receiving hundreds of ready-to-buy customer names off the Web. And you save money because your price doesn't reflect advertising, test drives, sales commissions, and so on.\nMy only regret is that I didn't think up Auto-By-Tel first.", "id": "high17814.txt"}
