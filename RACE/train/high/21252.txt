Nikki spent a very small amount of time with her mum and sister when she was about 6 years old, but soon after contact  stopped when communication broke down between her parents.\nShe never felt she wanted to find her family while she was growing up. But now with a husband and a son she decided it was the right time.\nNikki didn't know where to start, but her husband's mum had used 192.com for finding people before and recommended  it to her . With the help of her son, she started by searching for her sister's full name on the electoral roll  without a location, because she had no idea where she lived, even her date of birth. From that one search , the site returned two results listed in the area they used to live.\nNikki decided to call the first number. To her   surprise, it was her long lost sister ! So after 20 years, it was one phone call that helped her contact her sister! Her sister then passed her number on to her mother, who called Nikki straight away, and it was like they had never been apart.\nHer mum was so glad to find out Nikki was well that they arranged  to meet everyone that Saturday (3 days after the phone call) where she was reunited with her sister and met her 2 nephews for the first time . Nikki also found out she had a half  sister and brother.\nWhen talking about the reunion , Nikki said , \"192.com made finding my long lost family very easy. I was not on any social networking sites before and surprisingly neither was my sister or mum, so we would never have found each other that way.", "id": "high21252.txt"}
