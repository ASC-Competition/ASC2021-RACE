Believe it or not, it was a real happening.\nWe were on tour a few summers ago, driving through Chicago, when right outside of the city, we got pulled over. A middle-aged policeman came up to the car and was really being troublesome at first. Lecturing us, he said, \"You were speeding. Where are you going in such a hurry?\" Our guitarist, Tim, told him that we were on our way to Wisconsin to play a show. His way towards us totally changed. He asked, \"Oh, so you boys are in a band?\" We told him that we were. He then asked all the usual band questions about the type of music we played, and how long\nwe had been at it. Suddenly, he stopped and said, \"Tim, you want to get out of this ticket, don't you?\" Tim said, \"Yes.\" So the officer asked him to step out of the car. The rest of us, inside the car, didn't know what to think as we watched the policeman talk to Tim. Next thing we knew, the policeman was putting Tim in the back of the police car he had parked in front of us. With that, he threw the car into reverse  , stopping a few feet behind our car. Now we suddenly felt frightened. We didn't know if we were all going to prison, or if the policeman was going to sell Tim on the black market or something. All of a sudden, the policeman's voice came over his loudspeaker. He said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, we have Tim here singing on Route 90.\" The policeman had told Tim that the only way he was getting out of the ticket was if he sang part of one of our songs over the loudspeaker in the police car. Seconds later, Tim started screaming into the receiver. The policeman enjoyed the performance  , and sent us on our way without a ticket.", "id": "high19131.txt"}
