This is natural----during teens, a person's body needs more nutrients  to grow. Snacks are a great way to satisfy that hunger and get all the vitamins and nutrients your body needs.\nBut you need to pay attention to what you eat. Filling your stomach with a lot of fries after class may give you a short-time help, but a snack high in fat and calories will only slow you down in the long time.\nTo keep energy levels going---and avoid gain weight---keep away from foods like candy or soda. Look for foods like bread and grains and combine them with some food like peanut butter or low-fat milk or cheese.\nChoosing healthy snacks means shopping smart. Be careful of the health instructions on food bags. Here are some things to watch out for.\nThat something is \"all natural \" doesn't necessarily mean that it's nutrients.
