He was put on permanent disability, but he still wanted to do something to keep himself busy, so he decided to volunteer at the local children's hospital. My dad loved kids. It was the perfect job for him. He would talk to them and play with them and do arts with them. \n    One of his kids was a girl with a rare disease that paralyzed   her from the neck down. I don't know the name of the disease, but I do know that it was very sad for a girl around eight or nine years old. She couldn't do anything, and she was very depressed. My dad decided to try to help her. He started visiting her in her room, bringing paints, brushes and paper. He stood the paper up against a backing, put the paintbrush in his mouth and began to paint. He didn't use his hands at all. Only his head would move. He visited her whenever he could and painted for her. All the while he would tell her, \"See, you can do anything you set your mind to.\" \n    Finally , she began to paint by using her mouth, and she and my dad became friends. Soon after, the little girl was discharged . One day, in the lobby of the hospital, my dad noticed the front doors open and then in came the little girl who had been paralyzed, but this time she was walking. She ran straight over to my dad and hugged him really tight. She gave him a picture she had done using her hands. At the bottom it read: \"Thank you for helping me walk.\" \n    My dad would cry every time he told us this story and so would we. He would say: \"sometimes love is more powerful than doctors.\"", "id": "high24037.txt"}
