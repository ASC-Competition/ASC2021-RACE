Researchers found that red knot wading birds double their normal body weight of 100 grams before making their twice-a-year nonstop flight between the British Isles and the Russian Arctic. Distance: 5,000 kilometers.\n    Another study in the magazine Nature measured the advantage of flying in an aerodynamic group which allows birds to save energy by flying smoothly and quietly in the lead bird' s air stream.\n    Flying in groups, their heart rates were 14.5 percent lower than flying alone, according to Henri, a French scientist. The findings help explain how birds complete difficult migrations. Researchers had thought that thinner, stronger birds would have the best chance to survive.\n    The first study suggests that building up fat to be burnt as fuel during the migration is worth more than the energy it takes to carry the additional weight.\n    In the study, researchers said their team studied the birds flown at different body weights during 28 simulated  flights. They forced a small amount of special water into the birds' bodies so that they could measure the amount of energy burnt during the flight.", "id": "high21542.txt"}
