One reason is the wonderful riches under the earth: gold, silver, iron, coal and many other precious metals. Oil and natural gas have helped to build big industries. Victoria, the southeastern state, has a large number of industries. Oil is no problem for them. The Bass Strait, off the coast of Victoria, has been one of the country's biggest oil fields for many years.\nSouth Australia is the driest of all the states, but it does have the Murray River. The river brings greenness and life to the state's southeast corner. In the early days of Australian history, the Murray River was South Australia's main road. Before real roads and railways came, the river carried people and goods from the coast up into the country. Some towns on the Murray still keep the old riverboats, and visitors can ride on them.", "id": "high4909.txt"}
