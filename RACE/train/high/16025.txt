March 22 is World Water Day, which has the theme \"Water and culture \"this year. There are more than one billion people in the world who live without safe drinking water. The United Nations hopes to cut this number in half by 2015.\nSolving such a big problem seems like an unreal challenge. But everyone, even teenagers, can do something to help. A teenage girl in the U.S. has set an example to others of her age around the world. Rene Haggerty, 13, was awarded the 2004 Gloria Barron Prize for her work of collecting deserted batteries which pollute water.\nIn 2003, Haggerty went on a field trip to the Great Lakes Science Centre in Ohio. There, she saw an exhibit about how chemicals in old batteries harm the water of Lake Erie. Haggerty learnt that recycling the batteries was an easy solution. \"I think everybody can do it, because everyone uses batteries, and it can make a big difference.\" With these words, she began to increase awareness in her area.\nShe talked to her county government and school board. She got permission to start a recycling programmed in schools as well as the public libraries, hospitals, and churches. With the help from her family, friends and local waste-management officials, she gathered containers, arranged transportation, and made an educational video.\nOver the past two years, she collected four tons of batteries and drew the attention of officials, who were in charge of a battery recycling programmed but had made little progress. When asked if she feels like a hero, Haggerty is quite modest . \"Not really. Well, maybe for the fish I saved!\"\nEvery year the Gloria Barron Prize honors young Americans aged 8 to 18 who have shown leadership and courage in serving the public and the planet. Each year ten winners receive $2,000 each, to help with their education costs or their public service work.", "id": "high16025.txt"}
