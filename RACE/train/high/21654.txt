China said that Arafat is the true leader , elected by the Palestinian people , and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East . This idea is shared by other governments .\nArafat himself said : \"They can kill me , but never get me out of my country .\" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel .But , just like a cat with nine lives , Arafat escaped every time .\nFor years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night , thinking a moving person is harder to hit . In 1985 , Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat . The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt . In 1992 , the aircraft in which he was flying over north Africa broke in two during a crash landing . The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive .\nWhat is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger .\nIsraeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ramallah in December , 2001 . When they saw the attackers coming , Arafat's bodyguards ignored his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground . Seconds later , several bombs were dropped nearby . Though safe , his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat .\nBut , Arafat , with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away , showed no fear at all . He stayed in the damaged office , talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel . \nAll these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others .\nBut has he used up the last of his nine lives ? Only time will tell .", "id": "high21654.txt"}
