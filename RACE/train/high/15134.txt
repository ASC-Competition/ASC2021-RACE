The institute said Allan's work had made a big effect on global trade policy and research, especially in water-scarce   regions.\n\"The improved understanding of trade and water management issues on local, regional and global scales are of the highest value for the successful and sustainable   use of water resources,\" it said.\n\"People do not only use water when they drink it or take a shower,\" the institute said. \"Behind the morning cup of coffee, there are 140 liters of water that was used to grow, produce, package and ship the beans.\" That is about as much water as a person in England uses on average for all daily drinking and household needs.\n\"For a single hamburger, about 2,400 liters of water are needed.
