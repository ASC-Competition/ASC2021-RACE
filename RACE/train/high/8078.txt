Last year, California had the least amount of rain since officials began keeping records. And it may be just as bad this year.\nReservoirs are areas where water is stored. In California, some reservoirs are empty. The amount of snow in the Sierra Mountains is 75 percent below normal. This mountain snow melts in the spring and fills rivers. The water is used by farmers. But now, farmers are warning of the possibility of another \"Dust Bowl\", like the one of 1930s. Severe droughts and dust storms covered American farmlands and few crops grew.\nDan Errotabere is a third generation California farmer. He grows tomatoes, walnuts, garlic and other crops in Fresno County. He says the federal agency that controls the amount of water released from dams and rivers has stopped giving him water. He and other farmers say officials are not correctly administering the water system. \"The last couple of years-dry years, along with severe environmental restrictions--has now presented us with a zero allocation year\", said he.\nFarmer may not be able to plant crops on more than 200,000 hectares of farmland in the Central Valley this spring. Mr. Errotabere will plant crops on just 80 percent of this farmland. He has enough work for only 15 of his 25 workers.\nFederal and state officials sometimes reduce the amount of water to farmers even in years with normal rainfall levels. The officials must supply water to the Sacramento River Delta which is home to several endangered species.\nLong-term solutions include conservation, recycling waste water and, building \"desalinization  enters\". These center remove salt from seawater so _ can be used on farms. Farmers say better administration of the state's water system could also help solve the crisis.", "id": "high8078.txt"}
