A plan to fine students up to $75 for each day they skip school is now being considered by New Britain authorities.\nThe concept of fining kids for skipping school may come as a shock, but it's not new. In Ohio, the parents responsible for a student guilty of habitual truancy can be fined up to $500 and/or be required to perform up to 70 hours of community service. Until recently, students in Los Angeles could be hit with a $250 punishment for each count of truancy; in early 2012 the law was changed and the heavy fines were removed, though a $20 punishment may still be handed out if a student truants for the third time.\nFines for truancy are also in effect overseas. In the UK, The Guardian reports, parents can be fined PS50 (about $80) per skipped school day. The punishment doubles if it's not paid within 28 days.\nThe question is: Do fines like this work? The vast majority of authorities in the UK said that, indeed, they do. The fines were believed either \"very successful\" or \"fairly successful\" by 79% in reducing truancy, according to a survey.\nIf the plan is passed in Connecticut, it's unclear how effective the law might be, how to make parents and students obey the law and what might happen if they refuse to pay. However, local officials seem to be willing to _ . According to the Hartford Courant:\n\"The mayor agrees that truancy is a real issue in New Britain schools, and what's been done in the past hasn't been working to reduce truancy.\" said Phil Sherwood, assistant to Mayor Timothy O' Brien.\nAnd what do the students think? In the New Britain Herald, one 17-year-old entering her senior year called the plan \"ridiculous\" and predicted that the punishments will bring about negative effects on the court system. Besides, \"I don't see the point,\" she said. \"Kids will just try harder not to get caught.\"", "id": "high3145.txt"}
