He was Dr Allan Woolley and he was only 52. Suddenly he took his own life, which remains a mystery.\nThat morning, everyone sensed that something wasn't right. During our lessons, an announcement was made that an assembly   was scheduled for morning break, which was only done in emergencies.\nOnce morning break came, the entire school gathered in the main hall. As our headmaster marched out to announce the \"momentous   news\", it felt like the air around us trembled . Many students broke down in tears, and the reaction afterward was intensely powerful and unifying .\nThe headmaster said that students were allowed to miss lessons and have a free period to _ themselves if they found the news too distressing  . Many students went outside and shared memories of Dr Woolley to control theirselves.\nDr Woolley taught me chemistry two years ago, but up until his death he still taught many of my close friends. Many of my friends were so shocked that they still couldn't believe the person that they had owed   some homework to was now dead.\nIt was heart-warming to spend time with teachers that morning and get to know more about them. _", "id": "high7298.txt"}
