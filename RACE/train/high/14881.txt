The 7-year-old was seriously disabled because of his autism .  Unable to speak, he withdrew from people at school and, worse, from his family.\nIn March 2003, Miller was introduced to Jeff Hancock, a one-on-one therapist  for people with autism. Hancock was hired to be John's companion. The two would go people-watching at the mall on the weekend. Hancock chatted throughout their trips, even though John couldn't talk back.\nTheir relationship developed when Hancock introduced John to the Special Olympics. Whenever John was running or being active, he was smiling.\nWhen John turned 12, Hancock introduced him to track at the Special Olympics. For the first three years, the pair just observed the sport by watching practices and events. Hancock worked daily with John, showing him everything, including where to sit, stand and walk, so he would understand the flow of the events.\nEventually, the lessons clicked, and John was off doing 50-meter sprints. But as John got older, he got stronger and faster. At 16, he was jumping hurdles and doing 800-meter races. Miller started seeing her son as a serious athlete.\nIn May 2014, John's training brought him to the Special Olympics State Summer Games in Orlando. The 18-year-old was competing in the 800 meters and the 110-meter hurdles.\nAs the 800 was setting up, Miller remembered, she pressed her face against the fence, anxiously waiting for John to compete. But as soon as the race started, all Miller saw was an athlete, her athlete.\n\"I just wanted to see the best performance. It seemed much more significant than whether he would ever speak or respond to me,\" she said.\nJohn ended up winning the gold medal for the 800. Sports completely changed John, and Miller said that is because of Hancock.\"A person with a disability can feel hopeless and isolated, and I think that can happen to parents, too. \"", "id": "high14881.txt"}
