It also notes a large increase in the number of international students form China. These findings are from the latest edition  of the Open Doors Report.\n   The report tells the record number of international students in the United States during the 2011-2012 school year. It says more than 764,400 such students were attending American colleges and universities during that period. That means an increase of almost 6% compared to one year earlier. By comparison  ,the number of Americans who are studying overseas increased by 1%.\n   The report says 194,000 students at American colleges and universities are from China. That is an increase of more than 23% over the year before. Peggy Blumenthal is an assistant to the president of the Institute of International Education. She says many Chinese families are able to pay for the highest-quality education for their children. The children mainly choose to study in America.\" We know many of them have enough income to be able to afford to send them anywhere in the world that they want to go. And for the most part, looking around the world, Chinese students still prefer to come to the United States as their destination of choice.\" She says.\n   Chinese students are not the only ones who want to attend American colleges and universities . After China, India sends the second largest number of students to the United States for higher education. India has about 100,000 students in American schools. South Korea is third with about 70,000 students.\n   Why do so many foreign students study in the United States ? Peggy Blumenthal provides one reason. \" The advantage America has is that we have a huge system and a very diverse   system. So there are over four thousand universities and colleges in the United States, and what it tells us is that there is still a lot of room to contain international students.\"", "id": "high17338.txt"}
