That is, you will come across obstacles  to discourage your progress. Actually, they are a part of life. Everyone would have every success they ever wanted if there were no obstacles. Your job is to be persistent and work through those obstacles. If you find little or no obstacles along the way, chances are that you are not really challenging yourself. And when you do reach your goal, you won't experience the feeling of \"sweet success\". Make your goal a challenging one!\nIf you take the time to study any successful person, you will learn that the vast majority of them have had more \"failures\" than they have had \"successes\". This is because successful people are persistent; the more they stumble and fall, the more they get right back up and get going again. On the other hand, people that don't get back up and try again, never reach success. For example, Walt Disney was turned down 302 times before he got financing for his dream of creating the \"Happiest Place on Earth\". Today, due to his persistence, millions of people have shared \"the joy of Disney\".\nHaving known these facts, keep in mind that you must constantly reevaluate your circumstances and the approach you are using to reach your goal. There is no sense in being persistent at something that you are doing incorrectly! Sometimes you have to modify your approach along the way. Every time you do something you learn from it, and\ntherefore find a better way to do it the next time.\nToday is the day to begin your journey, using consistency and persistency, towards tomorrow's successes!", "id": "high1916.txt"}
