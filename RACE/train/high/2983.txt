However, a firefighter who dressed as \"Spiderman\" succeeded in saving him.\nFirefighter David Smith was called in after the 6-year-old's teachers and mother had failed to get him down from the balcony. \"He was asking for his mother, \"Smith said. \"He was crying, and wouldn't let any of us get near him.\" After hearing a conversation between the boy's mother and his teachers about his love of superheroes , Smith hurried home to get his Spiderman clothes.\n\"I told him 'Spiderman is here to save you. No one will hurt you now,'\" Smith said. \"Then I told him to walk slowly toward me. I was really nervous that he might fall if he got too excited and started running.\" Then the crying boy broke into a smile and walked into the fireman's arms.\nThe fictional   superhero was created by writer Stan Lee in the early 1960s.
