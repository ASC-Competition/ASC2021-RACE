Recently, a 9-year-old boy showed a Georgia woman how to perform CPR on her newborn baby.\nSusanna Rohm said she had experienced a parent's worst nightmare   -- her 2-month-old son, Isiah, was not breathing. \"I noticed he looked pale. I looked at his arms and his legs and they were limp  ,\" Rohm told a local newspaper. \"Then I noticed that he looked like he wasn't alive.\" In _ , she dropped and broke her cellphone. Rohm had to run into the street, screaming for help.\n\"I had him in my arms and screamed over and over. Then I ran outside. I saw two boys playing across the street, and I yelled, 'Go and ask your parents to call 911,'\" Rohm said. But the two boys were able to do more than that. Nine-year-old Ethan Wilson took action, showing Rohm how to perform CPR on little Isiah while ten-year-old Rocky Hurt helped as well.\nRocky said he had learned the CPR technique from a poster in a health class at their school, Sedalia Park Elementary. \"I was thinking we'd better give her a helping hand instead of getting scared,\" Ethan said. \"I told her to push on the baby's chest five to ten times a minute with only two fingers, tilt back the baby's head, plug the baby's nose and breathe into the baby's mouth,\" Ethan said in an interview.\nAt last, Isiah began crying and was breathing again. He spent two nights in a local hospital. \"If the little boy hadn't shown me what to do right there, my baby would probably not be alive right now,\" Rohm said.", "id": "high8176.txt"}
