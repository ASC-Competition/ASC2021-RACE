According to them, human beings are divided into types: A-People, and B-People. A-People have no problem getting up in the morning, and operate much better earlier in the day. However, B-people are better later in the day. \"I'm useless early in the morning,\" says one of the members of the B-Society.\"All I can do is drink coffee, and stare into space. People used to get up early because they had to feed the animals. But I haven't got any cows or chickens, so I can sleep late,\" She adds. Since the society was set up, the B-Society has welcomed several thousand members.\nRight now, the B-Society is fighting hard for businesses to join its B-certification   list. Companies that are \"B-certified\" basically give their employees the opportunity to come in when they want. In some companies, employees arrive at any time up to 3:30 pm --- each to their own rhythm  .\nAnd it is not just businesses that are benefiting from this. Teenagers who can't get out of bed in the morning, and parents who never quite get the kids to school on time, can now benefit from B-classes. From next year, a school in Copenhagen will offer classes which start later in the day (at 10 instead of eight). And even the government seems to like the idea.\nThe B-Society was founded by Camilla Kring, a professor from the University of Copenhagen. On her website, she says, \"When B-people's work rhythms are considered at the work place, their productivity   and quality of life is increased, which can increase productivity for the entire organization.\"\nShe adds that, \"B-Society will create a new daily rhythm in schools and other institutions   as an alternative to the current rhythm of 'early at work and early at home'. We are working for the establishment of kindergartens, primary and secondary schools as well as universities that open between 10 am and 8 pm.\"\nWould you like to work for a B-certified company?", "id": "high13801.txt"}
