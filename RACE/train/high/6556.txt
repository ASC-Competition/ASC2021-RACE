But not at the gas pump or electric battery charger --at the air pump! That's not hot air, either! The next generation of cars may run on thin air. Wouldn't that be an incredible way to cut both pollution and dependence on foreign oil?\nIf you've ever inflated a balloon and then let it go, you've got the basics to test-drive the amazing MiniCAT, currently being developed by Noteur Development International (MDI), headquartered in Luxembourg. Invented by Formula One racing car designer Guy Negre, this experimental vehicle is unlike any car you've ever seen. While your family's traditional car or SUV draws its horsepower using combustion, the only fuel that MiniCAT needs (CAT stands for Compressed Air Technology) is the air we breathe.\nStart with about 25,000 gallons of air. Now, press it all into a space smaller than your school locker--because that's the size of two super-strong, high-pressure air tanks, made from fiber and fixed beneath the air car.\n _ that much air inside those small tanks generates an internal pressure of over 4,000 pounds per square inch. That's over 300 times normal air pressure.\nWhen this cold, high-pressure air enters MiniCAT's unique engine, it interacts  with warmer air to create pressure waves that pump the engine's engineered pistons   to move the car. MiniCAT's projected top speed is 60 miles per hour, with a range of 120 miles on a full air supply.", "id": "high6556.txt"}
