He'd never been caught by the police because he never took chances.He was always prepared for any unforeseen event or emergency.\nConfidently,he stood outside the house of his intended victim and read the sign on the front gate of the house.\"Don't worry about the dog--be aware of the owner!\" it said.Buster smiled and found his way in.\nThe house looked quite normal outside,but inside it was very exotic with fascinating objects on display.As he began putting them into his bag,a dog came into the room.It stopped when it saw Buster,then wagged its tail madly and went over to him,licking his outstretched hand.  \"Good boy,\" Buster whispered. \"What a great guard dog you are--trying to lick me to death.\" Satisfied he'd made friends with the dog,Bluster began to wander round the house,choosing items to put in his bag.His skilled eye picked out only the best antiques :a pair of silver candleholders,a silver tea-and-coffee service,etc..His new friend,the dog,sat and watched,as if wondering what was happening.\n\"Well,boy,\" Buster whispered,finally.\"That might do.Any more and I won't be able to carry it!\" He swung the heavy bag onto his shoulders, just as the lights came on, nearly blinding him. He shielded his eyes with his hand.\n\"You're a very silly person,\" the figure in the doorway said, his voice dry and dust. As the man came closer, Buster could see he was well dressed. His face seemed familiar, but Buster couldn't quite place where he had seen him before.\n\"You should have taken more notice of the sign outside,\" the man rasped. \"I knew about this attempted robbery last week and I also know you will end up behind bars for 20 years. Fancy trying to rob the house of the world's greatest fortune-teller!\"", "id": "high466.txt"}
