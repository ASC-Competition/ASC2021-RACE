They make too much noise in shopping malls; they drive carelessly up and down America's main streets. And at least some of the time those things are true.\nBut we shouldn't forget that there are hard moments in the life of a teenager too.\nI watched such a moment not long ago at a woman's funeral which happened in a church.
