Doctors told his parents that he had a hole in his heart and \"they didn't think I had a lot longer to live\". But during a later visit to the doctor, his family learned the hole had closed. \"Somehow I was cured and I became a normal kid,\" Fujiyama says. \"And I had a second chance.\"\nDuring his second year at the University of Mary Washington, he volunteered in Honduras with a campus group and was struck by the extreme poverty he saw--barefoot children collecting cans and sleeping in the streets. Fujiyama realized he could help give other children their own second chance.\nToday, his organization, Students Helping Honduras, brings education and community projects to children and families in need.\nHe started by telling his friends about his experience and collecting spare change at his two campus jobs. \"When I had my very first meeting, only two people showed up,\" he says. \"I knew I had to keep fighting.\" He persuaded his younger sister, Cosmo, to join the cause. \"She's dynamite,.\" He says. \"When she talks in front of a crowd, she can move mountains. Knowing that she was behind it, I knew I could do anything.\" Since 2006, the _ organization has grown to 25 campuses and raised more than $750,000 to fund projects, including the construction of two schools and the establishment of scholarships to help young women attend college.\nFujiyama says students are deeply committed to the organization. They raise money and then travel to Honduras to help building houses. While Fujiyama spends his summers in Honduras working alongside volunteers, he spends a large portion of the year on the road visiting colleges to raise funds. Cosmo Fujiyama, 23, lives in Honduras full time to coordinate the group's building efforts on the ground.\nStudents Helping Honduras is working with community members of Siete de Abril to build a new village. Many of the families lost their belongings in Hurricane Mitch in 1998. A lot of them didn't have access to clean water or health care, and they didn't have a school. Fujiyama's group helped build 44 homes in the village named \"Sunshine Village\". The organization is also raising funds to build a water tower, an eco-friendly sanitation system and a library.", "id": "high15213.txt"}
