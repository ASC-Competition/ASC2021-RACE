We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't\"; and Meg shook her head, and she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted. \n\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from mother or you, but I do want to buy UNDINE AND SINTRAM for myself; I've wanted it so long,\" said Jo, who was a bookworm. \n\"I planned to spend mine on new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh. \n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need them,\" said Amy, decidedly. \n\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner. \n\"I know I do - teaching those tiresome children nearly all day when I am longing to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone again. \n\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to fly out of the window or cry?\"\n\"It's naughty to fret; but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world.  _ and my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all\"; and Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that anyone could hear.\n\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do.\" cried Amy, \"for you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn't rich.\"\n\"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if papa was a pickle-bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing. \n\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be satirical about it. It's proper to use good words, and improve your vocabulary,\" returned Amy, with dignity. \n\"Don't peck at one another, children. Don't you wish we had the money papa lost when we were little, Jo? Dear me! How happy and good we'd be, if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times. \n\"You once said you thought we were a deal happier than the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in spite of their money.\"\n\"So I did. I think we are; for, though we do have to work, we make fun for ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\" Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle. \n\"Don't, Jo; it's so boyish!\"\n\"That's why I do it.\"\n\"I detest rude, unladylike girls!\"\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\n\"Birds in their little nests agree\" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the `pecking' ended for that time.", "id": "high21407.txt"}
