I have no trouble talking when I'm alone. However, when I talk with others, my voice sounds different, and sometimes there is a pause   between each word I pronounce. Sometimes I can't pronounce a word even with my own family members. My voice becomes deeper and sounds totally different than it usually does. Can you please give me some good advice?\n                                                                          John\nJohn, \n    If you have trouble pronouncing words, simply accept the fact. Many other readers have such experiences, and so do I. You don't need to get stressed about it.\n   You are apparently getting nervous because you feel like you are under some pressure when speaking to other people. Take your time and don't worry about pauses. Speak slowly, opening your mouth to enunciate your words clearly. Listen to powerful leaders on the television and note that they speak slowly and carefully and learn to master their speaking techniques.\n    When you speak to others in college, try to ask questions that will get the other person to talk. Listening carefully and then filling in during the conversation takes the pressure off you and you will feel more relaxed when you talk. You make more of an impression when you are interested in what the other person is saying than when you try to lead a conversation.\n    Remember that the more you worry about how your voice sounds, about pronouncing words and about pauses, the worse it gets. So accept the way you speak now and relax in your conversations.\n    I hope these ideas can help take the pressure off you when you talk to other people. \n                                                                     Wilson", "id": "high21412.txt"}
