Scientists have discovered that old bees have trouble finding their way to new hives as their learning behavior becomes increasingly inflexible. \n  Bees are typically impressive navigators, able to wind their way home through complex landscapes after visits to flowers far removed from their nests. But researchers from Arizona State University and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences found that aging damages the bees' ability to extinguish the memory of an unsuitable nest site even after the group has settled in a new home. \n  To test how old bees adapt to a changed home location, researchers trained bees to a new nest box while their former nest was closed off. Groups composed of mature and old bees were given several days in which to learn the new home location and to extinguish the bees' memory of their unusable former nest box. The scientists then tore down the bees' new home and forced groups of mixed-age bees to choose between three alternative nest locations, including the former nest box. \n  Old bees began flying toward the former nest site, despite the experience that should have told them that it was unusable. \"Although many old bees fail in learning tasks, we also discovered that a few still perform with excellence,\" explains Daniel Minch, lead author of the study and a senior life sciences researcher in Norway. \n  The scientists believe that their findings with bees offer a new means to model and understand the variability found in brain function between individuals, where some individuals' memories remain complete, while others' learning behavior becomes inflexible with age.", "id": "high21880.txt"}
