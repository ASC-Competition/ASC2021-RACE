Even though it is in the busiest part of the city, it has grass and trees around it, and benches for people to sit on. Even more unusual in crowded New York, its rooms are very large. The roof of the Main Reading Room is 51 feet high. Here, a reader can sit and work in comfort. \nThe library has over thirty million books and paintings. It owns one of the first copies of a Shakespeare's play, a Bible printed in the 15th century, and a letter written by Columbus in which he tells of finding the new world.\nEvery New Yorker can visit the library and use its riches -- free.\nBut the cost of running the library has risen sharply in recent years, and the library has not enough money to continue its work. In the past, it was open every day. Now it is closed on Saturdays and Sundays and every evening to save money.\nThe library is trying to raise more money to meet its increasing cost. Well-known writers and artists are trying to help. So are the universities, whose students use the library, and the government of New York City. But the problem remains serious.\nYet a way must be found to save the library because, as one writer said,\"The Public Library is the most important building in New York City -- it contains all our knowledge.\"", "id": "high24119.txt"}
