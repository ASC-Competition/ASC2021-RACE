Boris grew annoyed,then depressed,then a little hardened.Still he went on trying and still he failed.He began to think that he had no future at all.\n\"Why don't you start your own business?\" one of his uncles told him.\"The world is a  money-locker. You'd better find a way of opening it.\"\n\"But what can I do?\"\n\"Get out and have a look round,\" advised his uncle in a vague sort of way.\"See what people want;then give it to them,and they will pay for it.\"\nBoris began to cycle around the town and found a suitable piece of a waste ground in the end. Then he set up his business as a cycle repairer.He worked hard,made friends with his customers and gradually managed to build up his goodwill and profit.A few months later, he found that he had more work than he could deal with by himself.He found a number of empty shops but they were all no good:in the wrong position,too expensive or with some other snag . But at long last,he managed to find an empty shop on a new estate where there were plenty of customers but no competition.\nBoris and his assistant taught themselves how to repair scooters and motor-cycles.Slowly  but surely the profits increased and the business developed.
