I found myself at a checkout counter behind an elderly woman seemingly in no hurry as she paid for her groceries. A PhD student with not a lot of money, I had hurried into the store to pick up some flowers. I was in a huge rush, thinking of my upcoming evening. I did not want to be late for this date.\nWe were in Boston, a place not always known for small conversation between strangers. The woman stopped unloading her basket and looked up at me. She smiled. It was a nice smile --warm and reassuring -- and I returned her _ by smiling back.\n\"Must be a special lady, whoever it is that will be getting those beautiful flowers,\" she said.\n\"Yes, she' s special,\" I said, and then to my embarrassment, the words kept coming out. \"It' s only our second date,but somehow I am just having the feeling she's 'the one' ,\"Jokingly, I added, \"The only problem is that I can' t figure out why she' d want to date a guy like me.\"\n\"Well, I think she's very lucky to have a boyfriend who brings her such lovely flowers and who is obviously in love with her,\" the woman said. \"My husband used to bring me flowers every week -- even when times were tough and we didn' t have much money. Those were incredible days; he was very romantic and -- of course -- I miss him since he' s passed away.\"\nI paid for my flowers as she was gathering up her groceries. There was no doubt in my mind as I walked up to her. I touched her on the shoulder and said, \"You were right, you know. These flowers are indeed for a very special lady.\" I handed her the flowers and thanked her for such a nice conversation.\nIt took her a moment to realize that I was giving her the flowers I had just purchased.\"You have a wonderful evening,\" I said. I left her with a big smile and my heart warmed as I saw her smelling the beautiful flowers.\nI remember being slightly late for my date that night and telling my girlfriend the above story. A couple of years later,when I finally worked up the courage to ask her to marry me,she told me that this story had helped to _ it for her -- that was the night that I won her heart.", "id": "high6602.txt"}
