Not too long ago I was having one of those days. I was discouraged, weary, and plain sad. My focus was on me. After all, no one else was experiencing the same trials I was.\nI expressed my upset state to my mother, hoping for some pity. Instead, she said, \"I heard Jamie was having a difficult day too. Why don't you make her some cookies and take them to her this afternoon?\"\nI didn't really want to, but decided that I didn't want to go back to my other problems just yet.
