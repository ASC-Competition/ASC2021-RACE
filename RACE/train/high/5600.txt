Users can download \"Google Wi-Fi\" software and then enjoy free Wi-Fi service available in some US cities since last Tuesday.\nWi-Fi is short for \"Wireless Fidelity\" . It allows laptop computers and personal digital assistants to the Internet at high speed by radio signal.\nA person with a Wi-Fi enabled computer can connect to the Internet when near one of the network's access points. The place covered by one or several access points is called a hotspot. Google has already set up two \"hotspots\" in the US city of San Francisco which provide a free Wi-Fi service.\nThe Wi-Fi technology even allows users to enjoy a free Internet phone service. Some scientists argue that Wi-Fi may replace mobile phone networks.\nWi-Fi is still limited to a few cities, where there are \"hotspots\". But its capability of sending information has already done better than that of the mobile phone network, even that of 3G(Third Generation Telecommunication Technology). Some scientists have started to call Wi-Fi 4G.\nIn addition to a high speed Internet connection, Wi-Fi has other advantages compared to mobile phones. Wi-Fi is global. The same Wi-Fi system works in different countries around the world. Different from using cell phones, you don't need to change computers to use Internet phones when you go to other places and most importantly, many Internet phones cost you nothing at all.", "id": "high5600.txt"}
