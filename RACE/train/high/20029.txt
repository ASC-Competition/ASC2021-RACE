About 30 percent of French consumers will give second-hand items as gifts to stretch out their tight budgets but also to do their little bit for recycling, according to a study by international consulting firm Deloitte.\nThe survey of Christmas consumer behaviors in 18 European countries found the French were more than twice as likely as other Europeans to give second-hand items. Websites promoting re-gifting and green gifting are popular in France, with many reporting a rise in business.\n\"Concerns about the ecology and the economy have come together and we are now seeing people who accept the types of gifts that were not appreciated just a short time ago,\" said Sebastien Ravut, who runs a website promoting eco-friendly consumerism. His site lists shops in France that offer fair trade products, bio-friendly goods and recycled items. Over the Christmas holidays, the number of visits to the site has doubled from last year, reaching 60,000 a month.\nA study by online survey firm Vivodi for PriceMinister showed eight out of 10 people would be happy to receive a used item as a gift and that younger consumers were more open to the idea.\nBut Gilles Goldenberg, author of the Deloitte study, said that environmental concerns are not why customers buy used goods. \"The number one concern is getting the lowest possible price,\" said Goldenberg. \"Eco-friendly products are drawing a lot of interest, but not if that means paying more.\"\nTheatre tickets and other low-carbon gifts are fashionable, and eco-friendly websites are also encouraging gift givers to offer time and services instead of stuff. \"The order of the day is to spend less time shopping and more time connecting\" over the holidays, said Florence de Monclin from the Nicolas Helot foundation for Nature and Humanity.", "id": "high20029.txt"}
