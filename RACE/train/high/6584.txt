Traditional heroes are no longer sought after anymore. Today, it's unconventional leading figure -like Francis J. Underwood from \"House of Cards\" who are winning audiences' hearts.\nThe political drama, which airs on the Internet service Netflix, has won the applauses of viewers around the world since its debut  on February 1, 2013. And it has caught the attention of real politicians, including US President Barack Obama.\nKevin Spacey plays Francis J. Underwood, a cold-blooded Democrat who moves his way up the political ladder by any means necessary. He often uses his under-exposure in media to carry out misdeeds that will later benefit him.\nThe revenge  theme plays a heavy role throughout the storyline, Underwood, who had high hopes for an appointment as Secretary of State in the first season, was betrayed by the US President and his former colleagues. He and his wife then conducted a plan of revenge and swore to unseat those who turned their backs against him. Through their plan, Underwood's own hunger for power grew and empowered him to get rid of whoever stood in his Way.\nThe release of the trailer  of the second season excited millions of viewers around the world, including US President Barack Obama, who has been a loyal fan since the series debuted. Obama expressed his admiration for Underwood. \"This guy's getting a lot of stuff done,\" he said. Although the President is anxious to watch the story unfold, he'd like to do it at his own pace. After the release of the second season on February 14, 2014, Obama sent words on his Twitter account, \"Tomorrow: @HouseOfCards. No spoilers , please.\"\nThe second season has promised to be darker, with more unexpected turnouts, and is to include more Chinese elements. \"Perhaps the team, including myself, has realized that in the next decade, Asia will be an extensively important region, and China will play an active role in its transition and change,\" says Spacey.", "id": "high6584.txt"}
