Increased vehicles have made the air polluted. Citizens find it difficult to breathe. Dumping toxic chemicals into the river has polluted the drinking water and ground water.\nAll of us, as concerned citizens, have discussed these problems in various meetings. We have come up with the following proposals .\nThe green roads are no longer green. Many trees and bushes have been cut. We propose restricting the movement of vehicles. Besides, we should make it compulsory to use anti-pollution devices on all vehicles. We should also plant more plants and trees along roads.\nThe Bada Nadi River has become a dumping ground of toxic chemicals from some factories. These toxic chemicals have killed nearly all the life in the river and polluted our drinking water and ground water. We propose that the Bada Nadi River be declared a protected water body. All the dumping should be banned and heavy fine should be imposed on the offenders . To _ the problem of managing toxic waste, we propose setting up a water treatment plant so that only clean water is discharged into the river. Cleaning up the river and introducing various fishes and plants to the river will bring it back to life.\nLastly, the noise pollution caused by honking horns and blaring loudspeakers has caused distress to one and all. Many people have suffered from noise-related illnesses. We propose a blanket ban on the use of loudspeakers. And\"no horn zones\"should also be declared in residential hospitals and school areas.\nI would request you to seriously consider our proposals and act accordingly.\nThank you!\nSincerely yours,\nA kind-hearted citizen", "id": "high4620.txt"}
