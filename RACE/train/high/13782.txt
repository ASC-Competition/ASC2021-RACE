But you may be surprised to know that British culture is also full of the color red. It's true: Go to Britain and you will see red everywhere.\nThere are red postboxes on street corners and on the sides of buildings. The British red phone box is famous all over the world. The famous double-decker   bus is red. Red is the color traditionally worn by British soldiers in battle  , and there is red in the UK's Union Jack national flag. Britain even has a famous team of stunt   jet fighters   called \"The Red Arrows\".\nTo go with British culture's love of red, British nature also features many red animals. A beloved bird is the robin  , which has a bright red breast  . At Christmastime in winter, the bird is commonly found on the greetings cards people send each other. There is also quite a rare animal called the red squirrel  . Foxes are red, and they used to be hunted by men in red outfits  .\nBut is red considered lucky to British people? A good way to see how a culture looks at a color is to look at the way it uses it in language. The results may surprise you. Even though Britain has a lot of red on its high streets and in its countryside, red is used quite differently as a metaphor  . If someone \"sees red\", they are angry. When a person is \"red faced\", they are out of breath or blushing  . Red is also a political color: it means a left-winger (blue is the color of the political right). To be \"in the red\" is to be in debt (someone in credit   is \"in the black\").\nLook hard enough and you'll find the color red being used in all countries. For instance the \"red heart\" symbol   is pretty universal. But whether the British realize it or not, red is everywhere in Britain. It does seem that the country is in love with the color.", "id": "high13782.txt"}
