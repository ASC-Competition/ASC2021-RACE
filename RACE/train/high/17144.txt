An employee of the Electric Utility of Amsterdam, lit the first Olympic flame in the Marathon Tower of theOlympic Stadiuminprefix = st1 /Amsterdam.\nThe modern practice of moving the Olympic Flame via a relay system from Olympia to the Olympic venue began with the 1936 Summer OlympicsinBerlin,Germany.\nThe relay, captured in Leni Riefenstahl'sfilm, \"Olympia\", was part of the Nazi propaganda machine's attempt to add myth and mystique to Adolf Hitler's regime. Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classicalGreecewas an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich.\nAlthough most of the time the torch with the Olympic Flame is still carried by runners, it has been transported in many different ways. The fire traveled by boat in 1948 to cross the English Channel, and it was first transported byairplanein 1952, when the fire traveled toHelsinki. All carriers in the torch relay toStockholm, where these events were held instead, traveled on horseback.\nRemarkable means of transportation were used in 1976, when the flame was transformed to a radio signal. From Athens, this signal was transmitted bysatellitetoCanada, where it was received and used to trigger alaserbeam to re-light the flame. In 2000, the torch was carried under water by divers near theGreat Barrier Reef. Other unique means of transportation include aNative Americancanoe, acamel, andConcorde. In2004, the first global torch relay was undertaken, a journey that lasted 78 days. The Olympic flame covered a distance of more than 78,000 km in the hands of some 11,300 torchbearers, traveling to Africa and South America for the first time, visiting all previous Olympic cities and finally returning toAthensfor the2004 Summer Olympics.\nAnother means of catching attention has been the lighting of the fire in the stadium.
