Submissions can be accepted as a blog post, cartoon, photo, short film or in any other form.\nThe winner with the best submission will receive a 12-day trip to Sweden and Switzerland and will be expected to report back on their impressions of both countries following the trip, the website states. Entries will be accepted until November 20.\nSweden and Switzerland aren't the only destinations that have caused confusion among travelers. Last month, a British holidaymaker hoped to explore the architecture of the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, but instead mistakenly caught a flight across the Atlantic to the Caribbean island of Grenada following a confusing booking mistake.
