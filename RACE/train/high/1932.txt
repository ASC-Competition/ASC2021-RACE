They soon forgot about the coin. After supper, Barton asked for his coin, but nobody could tell where it was. It was lost. One man said that everyone must be searched. One by one they turned their pockets inside out. Only Clinton refused, however.\"I didn't steal the coin, and I will not be searched,\" he said.After that, people turned their heads away from Clinton when they met him. He grew poorer. Soon his wife died.\nA few years later, Barton had his house repaired. The lost coin was found under the floor. Barton felt sorry and went to Clinton to apologize. \"But,\" he asked, \"you knew the coin was not in your pocket. Why did you refuse to be searched?\" \"Because I was a thief,\" Clinton answered. \"My pockets were full of food at that time. I had taken some food from the table to carry to my hungry wife and children.\"", "id": "high1932.txt"}
