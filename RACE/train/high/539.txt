He began his lesson by holding up a PS100 bill. Then he said to the three hundred students, \"Who would like to have this PS100 bill?\" The students began to put up their hands at once.\nThen he said, \"I am going to give this bill to one of you, but first, let me do this.\" He then made this bill into a ball. Then he said, \"Who wants it?\" Hands went into the air.\n\"Well,\" he said, \"What if I do this?\" and he dropped it on the floor and stepped on it. He picked up the dirty, crumpled bill and said, \"Who still wants it?\" _ \n\"My friends,\" he said, \"You've learned a valued lesson today. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it didn't go down in value. It was still worth PS100.\nMany times in our lives, we're dropped, crumpled, and stepped on by the chances we take and the things that happen to us. We feel as if we are worth nothing. But remember, no matter what has happened to you, you will never lose your value. You are always valuable to those who love you. Your value doesn't come from what you drop or whom you know,but WHO YOU ARE .\nYou are special and valuable. Don't ever forget it!", "id": "high539.txt"}
