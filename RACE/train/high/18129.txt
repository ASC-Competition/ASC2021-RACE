But now, young people aren't in any rush to start working. Less than 78 % of people aged 20 to 34 either have jobs or are looking for work, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (USA). That's down from the peak of 83 % in 2000, and the lowest since the 1970s. The biggest thing keeping young people out of work is the weak economy.\nBut there are other reasons as well -- what economists call \"structural changes\".\nStaying in school: Economists generally agree that, aside from the economy, extended education is the biggest reason why today's youth are shunning  the job market.\nMore people are going to college now -- 25 % more compared to 2000 -- and they're taking longer to finish. There are a few reasons why young people are spending more years at school.\nFirst, they're getting more advanced degrees. \"We used to say that a high school degree wasn't sufficient to provide a middle class income,\" said Bill Rodgers, a professor and chief economist at Rutgers University's Heldrich Center for Workforce Development. \"Now what we're saying no longer is a bachelor's degree. \"\nSecond, college is getting more expensive. Rodgers believes the increased financial burden of higher education is also causing people to take longer to finish, as they'll take fewer classes per semester or drop out for periods of time before scraping up   enough money to enroll again.\nStaying home: Since 2000, married women between the ages of 25 and 34 have been leaving the labor force  at a slightly higher rate than young people at large, according to BLS.\nThere could be many reasons for that, but Rodgers thinks stagnant (not growing) wages and rising child care costs are two of them. \"The recession  has caused a lot of people to think what they want in their lives,\"              said Rodgers. \"They've decided they want to spend time with their kids. \"", "id": "high18129.txt"}
