The White City building is where Thompson and the broadcaster's commercial division, BBC Worldwide, are based.\nBBC sources say the 2,500 job losses being proposed include the 650 cuts to the World Service already announced, with up to l,000 coming from BBC News.It is understood that some staff who have only just made the move to Salford could see their jobs at risk. Salford is now home to Radio5 Live, children's programs such as Blue Peter, and sports output including Match of the Day.", "id": "high6506.txt"}
