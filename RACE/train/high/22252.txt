It also said that the 70 mph speed limit on motorways should be reduced or enforced to bring down the amount of carbon dioxide given off by cars The House of Common Enviromental Audit committee's latest report said that transport was the only sector of the UK where carbon  _ have continued to rise since 1990.\nIt said it was time for the Government to make demand for cheap air impossible by raising air passenger tax. Emissions from air traffic have risen by 5 times as much since 1900 and are continuing to rise.\nThe committee welcomed the recent introduction of changed car tax, which means that the lowest-carbon cars pay no road tax, while gas-guzzling 4x4s pay an increased rate of PS210. However, the MPs say it doesn't go far enough and are calling for a top limit of PS1,800 with lower limit of PS200.\nCommittee chairman Tim Yeo said : \"Air travel in particular is the fastest growing source of CO2, with emissions more than five times since 1900.
