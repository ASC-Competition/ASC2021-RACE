Once more, colleges and universities are changing their programs: they _ \"fun courses\" and restart some of the traditional subjects neglected   since the 1960s. Many great schools are again requiring the students to take a number of classes in English, history, literature, the social sciences, philosophy, the natural sciences, and art if they want to get a degree. Meanwhile, the experts are trying to describe the good education of our time. Obviously the purely vocational training once favored is not enough.
