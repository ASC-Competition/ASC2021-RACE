In 1992, I made two love songs to my darling wife and watched tears run down her face as I sang.\"Sam,\" she said earnestly, \"Your songs should be heard by more people.\"\nShe got my ballads and started bothering various media people about me, her singing barber husband.Two radio stations took an interest and played the songs.After the programme was aired, I became known in our community as the Singing Barber.\nThe biggest surprise, however, was still to come.I received a call from a music promoter who offered me a long-term recording contract.He explained that he would be investing a lot of money to market my songs.I needed to be wholly focused on selling my records all over Australia.\nBut I hesitated.\nMy friends all told me to go for it.And Mary also thought I should do.\"Go, Sam.I'll manage with the family...it'll be OK.\"\nI watched my daughter and son playing in the backyard.Soon they would both be in high school...and where would I be? I was so used to my family turning to me for love and support.If I were to start a singing career, I would not only miss them terribly, I'd also certainly miss out on watching them grow up.Signing this contract would put a huge gap between my family and me...and I couldn't bear it.My family was my life.So I refused the music promoter's offer.I'm still making music, I'm rich in love and I have no regrets.", "id": "high15652.txt"}
