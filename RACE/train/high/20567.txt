Consider the case of a young friend of mine, who was trapped in a traffic jam on his way to work shortly after receiving a warning about being late for the job. Although there was a good reason for Sam's a being late --serious illness at home -- he decided that this by-now-familiar excuse wouldn't work any longer. His boss was probably already pacing up and down preparing a dismissal speech.\nYes, the boss was. Sam entered the office at 9:35. The place was as quiet as a locker room  ; everyone was hard at work. Sam's boss came up to him. Suddenly, Sam smiled and stretched out his hand. \"How do you do!\" he said. \"I'm Sam Maynard. I'm applying for a job, which, I understand, became available just 35 minutes ago. Does the early bird get the worm?\"\nThe room exploded in laughter. However, the boss  _ a smile and walked back to his office. Sam Maynard had saved his job-- with the only tool that could win, a laugh. \nHumor is a most effective, yet frequently neglected  , means of handling the difficult situations in our lives. It can be used for patching up differences, apologizing, saying \"no\", criticizing, getting the other fellow to do what you want without his losing face. For some jobs, it's the only tool that can succeed. It is a way to discuss subjects so sensitive that serious dialogue may start a quarrel. For example, many believe that comedians   on television are doing more today for racial and religious tolerance than people in any other field.", "id": "high20567.txt"}
