Most kids would be thrilled to spend that money on toys, but not Lindsay. \"I didn't get the money; it went to the bank,\" she told the Columbus Dispatch.\nOver the years, Lindsay kept on raising and showing pigs, and kept on winning prizes. Some were $ 100 for small wins, but she won thousands of dollars for championship prizes at county fairs. Before long, she earned an impressive amount of cash--but, aside from a purse when she was 14, Lindsay had never spent a dollar of her savings. By the time she was 18, she had got more than $ 40,000, which she planned to put towards her college education at nearby Ohio University.\nBut her parents said that if she continued living at home while attending school, they wouldn't have to pay for her dorm housing, and would be willing to cover the entire cost of her education. It sounded like a good deal to Lindsay. But what should she do with her savings?\n Her father had an idea:buy a house, just as he'd done when he was young.

Lindsay was able to buy a house in Greenfield, paying for the entire purchase in cash. She did a bit of painting and then rented it out for $ 450 a month.\nAfter finishing college, Lindsay plans to marry Heath McNeal, and use the income from her house to buy a block of land and build a new house. But she'll never move too far from home. \"I would like to stay in Greenfield,\" she said. \"I just love everybody here. \"\nAt her current rate, she'll probably be the town's biggest real estate tycoon  by the age of 25.", "id": "high18920.txt"}
