It expresses agreement or approval. The word is used more often than any other word in the world.\nLanguage expert Allen Walker Read said the word began as a short way of writing a different spelling of the words \"all correct\". Old stories say some foreign-born people would write \"all correct\" as o-l-l k-o-r-r-e-c-t and spoke it as \"OK\". Some people say it came from the Native American Indian tribe known as the Choctaws. The Choctaw word \"okeh\" means the same as the American word \"OK\". Experts say early explorers in the Western America spoke the Choctaw language in the nineteenth century. The language spread across the country.\nAccording to some people, \"OK\" was a way to shorten Greek words that mean everything is fine. It is also said that a railroad worker named Obadiah Kelly invented the word. He is said to have put the first letters of his names -- O and K -- on each object people gave him to place on the train.\nAnother explanation is that \"OK\" was invented by a political organization that supported Martin Van Buren for president in the 1800s. They called their organization the OK Club. The letters O and K were taken from the name of the town where Martin Van Buren was born -- Old Kinderhook, New York.\nNot everyone agrees with these explanations, but experts do agree that the word is purely American and has spread to almost every country on Earth. Yet in the United States, it is used mostly in speech. Serious writers prefer using words, such as \"agree\", \"approve\" or \"confirm\" instead.", "id": "high4160.txt"}
