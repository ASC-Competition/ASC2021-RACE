Yohannes walks beside a pair of donkeys that are pulling a two-wheeled cart. They arrive at the agricultural town of Awassa where Yohannes opens the sides of the cart to display, not the usual vegetables or tools, but children's books. This is the Donkey Mobile Library, the first of its kind in Ethiopia and one of only a few in the world.\nYohannes was born in Ethiopia, North Africa, but trained to be a librarian in the USA and returned to Ethiopia years ago. The cart is full of picture books donated by American libraries, teachers and school children.\nYohannes arranges small painted benches in the shade of the trees, and suddenly Ethiopian children come shouting and racing down every road and path. It's mobile library day! They circle the bookshelves with great excitement. Until the Donkey Mobile Library began its regular two-monthly visits, many of these children had never seen a book.\n\"Without books, education is very dull, like food without salt. You can survive but you can't really come alive,\" says Yohannes. \"The ability to read is the basis for greater productivity, better health and longer life. Even though the children lack material goods, with books they can imagine a world of possibilities.\"\nYohannes first worked in the children's section of the main library in America. Surrounded by books he had never seen before, he realized how joyful and imaginative children's literature is. He says, \"I always thought of Ethiopia. But how could I bring children's books to my home country when it had almost no libraries to keep the books in?\"\nHe contacted Jane Kurtz, a writer born in America but brought up in Ethiopia, and together they created the Donkey Mobile Library. The children say that the Library has given them ideas about what they might do in the future. A child called Dareje wants to be a scientist and find a cure for life-threatening diseases. An eleven year-old girl, Fikerte, wants to do research about the moon and discover new facts about outer space. Tamrat, aged 10, comes every time.\n\"What brings you back here time and time again?\" the librarian asks him.\n\"The stories,\" Tamrat replies instantly.", "id": "high9712.txt"}
