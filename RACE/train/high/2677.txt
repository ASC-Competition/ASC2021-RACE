The girl was doing well. So she couldn't understand why, after three months of training, the instructor had taught her only one move.\n\"Instructor,\" the girl finally said, \"Shouldn't I be learning more moves?\"\n\"This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,\" the instructor replied.\nNot quite understanding, but believing in her teacher, the girl kept training.\nSeveral months later, the instructor took the girl to her first tournament. Surprising herself, the girl easily won her first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, her opponent became impatient and charged. The girl skillfully used her one move to win the match. Still amazed by her success, the girl was now in the finals.\nThis time, her opponent was bigger, stronger and more experienced. For a while, the girl appeared to be _ . Concerned that the girl might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. She was about to stop the match when the instructor intervened .\n\"No,\" the instructor insisted, \"Let her continue.\"\nSoon after the match restarted, her opponent made a serious mistake: she dropped her guard. Instantly, the girl used her move to pin her opponent. The girl had won the match and the tournament. She was the champion.\nOn the way home, the girl and her teacher reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the girl gathered the courage to ask what was really on her mind.\n\"Instructor, how did I win the tournament with only one move?\"\n\"You won for two reasons,\" the teacher answered. \"First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. Second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.\"\nThe girl's biggest weakness had become her biggest strength.", "id": "high2677.txt"}
