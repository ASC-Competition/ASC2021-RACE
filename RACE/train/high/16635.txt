A study suggests that a skin lotion   containing caffeine, which is also found in green tea, may reduce the risk of skin cancer. Two lotion tests were conducted on hairless mice that were exposed to high levels of ultraviolet radiation  . As a result, the lotion reduced the number of tumors   each mouse developed.\nUnlike sunscreen  , the new lotion is applied after exposure to the ultraviolet rays.
