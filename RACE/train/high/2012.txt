It was the first time I met Admiral Rickover, and we sat in a large room by ourselves for more than two hours, and he let me choose any subjects I wished to discuss. Very carefully, I chose those about which I knew most at the time - recent events, seamanship, music, literature, naval tactics , electronics, gunnery  - and he began to ask me a lot of questions that were more difficult. Every time after my answers, he soon showed that I knew rather little about the subjects I had chosen.\nHe always looked right into my eyes, and he never smiled. I was _ with cold sweat.\nFinally, he asked me a question and I thought it was my turn to show myself off. He said, \"How did you stand in your class at Georgia Tech before entering Annapolis as a first year student?\" I had done very well, and I threw my chest with pride and answered, \"Sir, I stood thirty-ninth in a class of 820!\" I sat back to wait for the congratulations - which never came. Instead, the question: \"Did you do your best?\" I started to say, \"Yes, sir,\" but I remembered who this was, and thought of several of my times at the Academy when I could have learned more about our allies , our enemies, weapons strategy  and so on, so I finally said, \"No, Sir, I didn't always do my best.\"\nHe looked at me for a long time, and then turned his chair around to end the interview. He asked one final question, which I have never been able to forget - or to answer. He said, \"Why not?\" I sat there for a while, shaken, and then slowly left the room.", "id": "high2012.txt"}
