But sometimes friendship's road is not always smooth, or it's a total dead end. What do you do when this happens?\nScenario  1: Drifting Apart \nYou've found that your friend no longer wants to jog  with you. She'd rather hit the chat rooms, or she's become crazy about hanging with her new interest.\nIt's a _ when old friends start having less in common. But it might still be worth trying to get into your friend's new interest, trying something new on your own, or meet some new folks who like doing the things you enjoy. Another thing to try is talking to your friend about it- in a non-this-is-your-fault  way. The goal is telling how you feel, not \"winning\".\nScenario 2: Fights\n\"Yes, he is.\" \"No, he isn't.\" the argument could continue forever.\nNo matter how sure you are that you're right, friendship is based on RESPECT. Since you and your friend aren't clones , you will disagree sometimes! Is it worth fighting over? If it is trivial , why not give it up? Agree to disagree  and get on well with life. Even if you'll never agree, try to see the other person's viewpoint. At least honor his right to have his own opinions. Never get physical. Violence can make a small problem into a disaster.\nScenario 3: End of the Road\nIs the friendship over? If you are not the one ending it, it feels as if a knife cut your heart into pieces. But the thing is that you can't force someone to be your friend. Give yourself time. But don't freeze in a looking-back, holding pattern . Be open to new friendship. You never know when the \"best friend forever\" will come along.", "id": "high8833.txt"}
