That is the result of a genetic experiment at the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans, US.\nMr. Green Genes is the first fluorescent  cat in the US and probably the world, said Betsy Dresser, the center's director.\nThe researchers made him so they could learn whether a gene could be introduced harmlessly into a cat's genetic sequence.\nIf so, it would be the first step in a process that could lead to the development of ways to treat diseases via gene therapy.\nThe gene, which was added to Mr. Green Genes'DNA, has no effect on his health, Ms Dresser said. \nCats are ideal for this project because their genetic makeup is similar to that of humans, said Dr Martha Gomez, a scientist at the center.\nTo show that the gene went where it was supposed to go, the researchers settled on one that would glow.\nThe gene\"is just a marker\", said Leslie Lyons, an assistant professor at the University of California, Davis. Lyons is familiar with the center's work.\n\"The glowing part is the fun part,\"she said.\nGlowing creatures made international news earlier this month when the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists who had discovered the gene through their work with jellyfish .", "id": "high18744.txt"}
