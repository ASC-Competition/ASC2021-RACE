Five finalists from Australia, Romania, U.S., Switzerland and France were in the final race. They came from a pool of 700 applicants from around the world, carefully selected by the Hangzhou Tourism Commission on their familiarity with China, social media presence and adventurous spirit.\nLocated about 100 miles southwest to Shanghai, Hangzhou is home to 844 million population and among China's richest cities as measures by per-capita GDP.

The city's mild climate and charming environment drew 97 million tourists last year, contributing to 6.5% of the city's GDP.\nThe lucky winner would start an all-expense-paid trip to Hangzhou, which, in addition to visits to tourist sites and tastings of delicious food, also would include a four-day ride along the Grand Canal and three evenings spent at a local resident's home.\n\"It is in fact a part-time job.
