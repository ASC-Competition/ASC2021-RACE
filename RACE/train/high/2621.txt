It's not something we intentionally trained him to do. The habit came simply because my husband tended to put him in his pen whenever they came in. After doing it a few times, Barney just figures that's what you do when you come inside after a car ride.\nIt's the same with your thinking. You get into the habit of thinking a certain way and then you'll rarely question it after that.\nThis is especially true when you were growing up. You developed habits that just made things easier for you. You probably didn't even think about them. That's just the way it was and that's what you did. Just like Barney thinks he has to go into his pen, you do things automatically as well.\nFor example, when you were a kid, you may have been told not to \"talk back\" and to just keep quiet about things that were bothering you. These are habits that might have worked to keep you safe and out of trouble when you were young.\nNow that you're grown up, you may be finding that these previous strategies are actually causing you problems. In a relationship, not communicating isn't going to work as your partner can't read your mind. What works when you're a child may not work when you become an adult.\nWhen you decide you need to change your thoughts, your brain may at first feel that it's not a safe thing to do. Lots of practice and years of experience says it's not. Also, you don't know to question the thought. It's a truth for you. The trick is to look at your results and see if your thoughts are the cause. Be willing to question your thinking and ask yourself if there are thoughts that are hindering   you. As you are now in a different phase of your life, different strategies may be needed.", "id": "high2621.txt"}
