These days, at high school graduation ceremonies, there are a lot more girls than boys.\nIn fact, every year, 10 percent more girls graduate from high school than boys. \"I think that there's a tendency to focus on boys as problems at this point, rather than recognize that boys have problems,\" says Joanne Max, PhD. Experts say the problems start in grade school, where there's often an emphasis on sports instead of reading, for example. \"I think that with boys there's some idea that it's not masculine to read,\" says Rob Jenkins, an English professor.\nThere's also a shortage of male teachers as role models. \"I think boys need role models, so if you're a boy and you don't have a dad in your home and then you have one male teacher and it's your athletic coach then I don't think you have a message that education is very important,\" says Carol Carter, another expert.
