Having traveled a long distance, they felt tired and settled down on a tree.  Just below the tree, they saw grains strewn   all over the ground. The pigeons were happy to have found enough food to eat. All the pigeons came down from the tree and started eating the grains. As they were doing so, a huge net fell on them and trapped them all.\nThe pigeons were taken aback. They noticed a hunter sitting at a distance from the tree, a bow and arrow in hand. The pigeons realized it was the hunter who had trapped them in the net. The hunter got up and began to move towards the pigeons.\nThe leader of the pigeons spoke, \"Friends, we are in great trouble. The hunter will catch us if we do not act swiftly in a few seconds. There is only one _ available at this moment. Let all of us use our force together and fly up along with the net. If all of us use our force and fly together, we can fly carrying the net along with us. Let us start now.\"\nAll the pigeons agreed with him and flew high carrying the net along with them. After traveling enough distance away from the hunter, the pigeons settled on a tree and carefully came out of the net one by one and thus escaped the evil design of the hunter.", "id": "high4755.txt"}
