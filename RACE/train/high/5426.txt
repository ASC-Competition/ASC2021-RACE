Then they exposed the _ to the virus, quarantined   them for five days and kept track of who got sick.\nBesides sleeping more, sleeping better also seemed to help the body fight illness: Patients who fared better on a measure known as \"sleep efficiency\"--the percentage of time in bed that you're actually sleeping--were also less likely to get sick.\nThe results held true even after researchers adjusted for elements such as body-mass index, age, sex, smoking and pre-existing antibodies   to the virus.\nThe researchers aren't exactly sure why sleeping better makes you less likely to develop a cold. But they do try to give an answer: \"Sleep disturbance influences the regulation of symptom mediators   that are released in response to infection.\" In plain English, maybe tossing and turning when you're infected with the cold virus contributes to the symptoms that define a cold.\nThe researchers were based at Carnegie Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Virginia, and the study was funded by the National Institutes of Health.", "id": "high5426.txt"}
