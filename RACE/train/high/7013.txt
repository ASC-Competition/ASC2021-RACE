What does the passage mainly talk about?"], "article": "I'm a real book lover. Every time my friends visit me, my nose is buried in a book. Wherever I go, I always have a book with me. Novels, history books, stories about people, journals and news--I read them all and I've learnt a lot, too. For example, many things in life happen for the best even if we don't like or understand them.\nWhy is reading such an enjoyable pastime for me? I probably first learned about it from my parents. My mother read to me at night in my childhood and bought me picture books. The greatest gift she has given me is a love for reading. And it will be a life-long habit.\nNo one ever asked me why I liked to read. They just saw me and asked, \"Oh? Is that for school work?\" And I just shook my head, \"No. It's just for fun.\" While reading a good book, I can totally forget myself and fly to another world. It's like exploring through someone's eyes, which is just as exciting as watching a movie.\nReading is also necessary in order to learn about writing, to improve my use of words and phrases and broaden my knowledge. What a pity to see our imagination disappear, for we don't exercise it often. Reading can even be good for one's health, I think. Everyone should read sad stories that make us cry and also books with humor that make us laugh out loud!", "id": "high7013.txt"}
