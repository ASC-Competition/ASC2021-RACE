Shorter check-in and security lines,and less waiting around.\n2.Use Public Transportation for City Travel to Save Time and Money\nWhen possible,take public transportation from the airport to your hotel.For example,the London-Heathrow express train takes just 15 minutes to get from airport to city and costs under 20 pounds.By contrast,\"A taxi costs about 70 pounds and takes 40 minutes,\"reports DiScala.\n3.Eat Smart,Explore...and Save\nLook for ways to take your order in pricey restaurants and you can avoid \"Are we about to run out of money?\"\"Don't order an appetizer.Don't drink a lot of booze,\" says DiScala.\nAlso,cover more ground by spreading out your snack places.\"Have dessert at a cafe or ice cream stand, instead of at the dinner restaurant,\" suggests DiScala.You'll see more of the city and decisions about where to go for dinner will be less worrying.\n4.Hit the Market\nMuch like reading the local newspaper,visiting a market gives context to a foreign country.\nEven the smallest villages tend to have a weekly open-air market(often on Saturday mornings) , while in larger towns and cities,expect additional market days,as well as big supermarkets.\nMarkets also sell amazing,wallet-friendly souvenirs.Think about sea salt,local spices or sauces,and regional oils and vinegars. Eatable gifts are almost always appreciated,saving you the stress of finding the\"perfect\"gift for each person on your list.", "id": "high6000.txt"}
