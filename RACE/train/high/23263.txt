At first,the music played bore no special relationship to the films;an accompaniment of any kind was sufficient.Within a very short time, however the _ of playing lively music to a serious film became apparent,and film pianists began to take some care in matching their pieces to the mood of the film.\nAs movie theaters grew in number and importance.a violinist would be added to the pianist in certain cases,and in the larger movie theaters small orchestras were formed.For a number of years the selection of music for each film program rested entirely in the hands of the conductor or leader of the orchestra,and very often the qualification for holding such a position was not skill or taste so much as the ownership of a large personal library of musical pieces.Since the conductor seldom saw the films until the night before they were to be shown (if indeed,the conductor was lucky enough to see them then),the musical arrangement was normally improvised   in the greatest hurry.\nTo help meet this difficulty,film distributing companies started the practice of publishing suggestions for musical accompaniments.In 1909,for example,the Edison Company began issuing with their films such suggestions of mood as \"pleasant\",\"sad\",\"lively\".The suggestions became clearer,and so appeared the musical sheet containing indications of mood,the titles of suitable pieces of music,and precise directions to show where one piece led into the next.\nCertain films had music especially composed for them.The most famous of these early special scores was that composed and arranged for D.W Griffith's film Birth of a Nation.which was shown in 1915.", "id": "high23263.txt"}
