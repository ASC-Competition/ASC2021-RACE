Let's find out how to stay focused.Follow each piece of advice that is given below.\nSwitch Off Your Cell phone\nNothing's worse for a teenager to stay without their cell phone even for a minute.However,if you can't find yourself focused for a long time,you know that it's the continual sound in your cell phone that isn't letting you learn.Stop sending text massages to your friends saying'I can't study'or'how much have you finished'.Remember,you don't have enough time to kill,do you?\nSoothing Music Helps\nBizarre  as it may sound,while things such as TVs,PCs,or MP3 players are not acceptable while studying,researchers claim that listening to soothing music actually helps you stay focused.Try it.It might work for you.\nA New Timetable Every Day\nOne of my personal techniques,tried and tested,is creating a new timetable every day. You don't really need to draw one.Instead,just stare at the clock,and divide your hours.Suppose.2 hours of continuous study require a 30-minute break after that.Relax and then go back to study for another two hours.Just be true to yourself, and try not to get distracted in those two hours.\nTry Different Places to Study\nThe idea is,looking for a place that doesn't have much to focus upon is the best way of staying organized while studying.A lonely corner in your house is perfect in this case.Hey! Why don't you go to your school library,if things get worse? It has the perfect atmosphere,silence,and a librarian,every time! Now this will work for sure,trust me.", "id": "high23104.txt"}
