I became terribly nervous. I felt in my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes, which had escaped their search. I found one and because of my shaking hands, I could hardly get it to my lips. But I had no matches, they had taken those. I looked through the bars at my jailer  . He did not make eye contact with me. I called out to him \"Have you got a light?\" He looked at me and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the cigarette, his eyes absently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. Anyway, I smiled. I know he didn't want to, but my smile went through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile.\nI kept smiling at him, now considering him as a person and not just a jailer. \"Do you have kids?\" he asked. \"Yes, here, here.\" I took out my wallet and nervously felt the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures of his family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes were filled with tears. I said that I was scared that I'd never see my family again, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too. Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell   and silently led me out and set me free.\n\"My life was saved by a smile.\" Yes, the smile--the unaffected, unplanned, natural relation between people. I really believed that if that part of you and that part of me could recognize   each other, we wouldn't be enemies. We couldn't have hate or scare.", "id": "high8857.txt"}
