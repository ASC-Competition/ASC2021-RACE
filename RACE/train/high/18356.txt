But to Dashan, the great challenge was _ due to his deep interest, proper method and the excellent environment he created for himself.\n       \"Interest is the best teacher.\" That is a universal principle. Even if he hadn't fully realized what attracted him to the Chinese department at the University of Toronto inCanada, he was already deeply interested in Chinese culture when he decided to have further study inBeijing.\n       Entering the Chinese department ofPekingUniversityin 1988, Dashan felt like a duck in water.
