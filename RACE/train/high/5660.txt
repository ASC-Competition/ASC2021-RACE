Today Steve Nash has to stand alone even if he doesn't enjoy it. The Phoenix Sun's point guard has to take ownership of a set of skills that sets him apart from every bigger, faster basketball player. He is considered the best basketball player in the game.\n31-year old Nash was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA on May 8, 2005. \"It's unbelievable,\" he said. \"It's been a long road for me and I really enjoy playing as a team, just trying to be a good teammate. That is the only way for me to highlight what I do as a basketball player.\"\nIt is the first time a Canadian has won any individual NBA honor. Of the 50 winners of the MVP award, only six have been guards: Steve Nash, Magic Johnson, Oscar Robertson, Michael Jordan, Allen Iverson, and Bob Cousy. \"I'm happy for him getting the MVP, which makes us feel like we all got the MVP,\" said Phoenix forward Shawn Marion.\nHe may be the only one who truly believes he can reach this level. \"I always try to set goals for myself and have my own time frame to accomplish them and I never give up on anything,\" he said. It is not as if Nash arrived at this point without countless hours of hard work.\nHis interests go far beyond sports and the NBA. His social conscience is such that he wore a T-shirt bearing an anti-war slogan at the NBA all-star weekend festivities in Philadelphia in 2002.\n\"A lot of great moments are when you win games with your teammates. There's nothing like sharing something with someone else,\" he said. \"There is a pinnacle   of a player's career individually. In many ways, the pinnacle of a player's career really is defined by team wins.\"", "id": "high5660.txt"}
