People were waiting in long lines at checkout counters to pay for small things that would be next-morning treasures under someone's Christmas tree.\nThe woman standing in cashier Jeffrey Kandt's line seemed to be living on the edge of subsistence . Her clothes were worn and her hands were those of a person who'd worked hard for what she had. She held a single item in her arms as she patiently waited to move to the front of the line -- a Sony CD player. She had saved all year for this. With tax, the total would be close to $ 220.\nAs the woman got close to the cashier, she suddenly shouted, \"Where's my money? All of my money fro my son's gift! Oh no!\"\n\"Why my line?\" Kandt thought as he watched the poor woman searching through her clothes. He was going to have to call his manager to avoid the sale but it would mean a long wait for the customers behind her. \"I am going to go home late tonight,\" Kandt thought.\nThen an amazing thing happened.

When the collection finally reached the registewr, Kandt counted $ 220.\nStrangers had fulfilled a poor woman's Christmas wish.\nThe poor in his line at the Wal-Mart in Cleburne, Texas, had come together on Christmas Eve, 2002.", "id": "high8288.txt"}
