They used to have money to spend, and free time to while  away. They used to wear teenage clothes, and meet in teenage coffee bars and discos. Some of them still do.

Teachers say that students work harder than they used to. They are less interested in politics, and more interested in passing exams. They know that good exam results may bring them better jobs.\nMost young people worry more about money than their parents did twenty years ago. They try to spend less and save more.
