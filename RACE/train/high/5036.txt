Everybody seemed to be looking for some kind of relief, so an ice cream store was a natural place to stop at.\nA little girl, holding her money firmly, entered the store. Before she could say a word, the store clerk sharply told her to get outside and read the sign on the door, and stay out until she put on the shoes. She left slowly, and a big man followed her out of the store.\nThe man watched as she stood in front of the store and read the sign. \"No Bare   Feet\".\nTears started rolling down her cheeks as she turned and walked away. Just then the big man called to her. After sitting down on the roadside, he took off his size-12 shoes, set them in front of the girl and saying, \"Here, you won't be able to walk in these, but if you slide   along, you can get your ice cream.\"\nThen he lifted the little girl up and set her feet into the shoes. \"Take your time,\" he said, \"I get tired of moving them around, and it's good to just sit here and eat my ice cream.\"\nThe shining eyes of the little girl could not be missed as she ordered her ice cream.\nHe was a big man, all right.
