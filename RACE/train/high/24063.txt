Exercise twice a week. Read more books. Lose weight. We make the same resolutions every year. But most of us fail, and quit after only a few days or weeks.Even the most successful among us, those who have climbed to the top of their fields, crash and burn when it comes to personal change. For example, President Barack Obama has struggled with his smoking habit.\n              So why is change so challenging? Are we wired in a way that keeps us from making changes? And do we need the support of others to reach our goals, or can we go it alone?\n              Professionals who help people make-changes in their lives suggest that the change is determined not by one's surroundings, but one's mind.Beginning with small goals or steps usually leads to a bigger pay-off later, they say.And trying to make a change is easier with support from a cheery group of friends, family, or co-workers with shared goals.But they caution that the experience is different for everyone.\n              \"People are more likely to make positive changes in their lives not only when their friends do, but when their friends of friends do, and when their friends of friends of friends do,\" said Nicholas Christakis, a professor of medical sociology at Harvard University.\"Social networks have this interesting property of magnifying   everything, and so taking advantage of your social network ties can result in a magnification of your own efforts.\n              Johnny Augustin understands that well.His goal was to reduce 30 pounds from his 237-pound frame.But the change didn't come easily.He said \"I'm a huge procrastinator.There is a desire but I just kept putting it off.I didn't get to do it until the summer.\"However, Augustin got inspired when he saw his older brother working out.Today, Augustin weighs 190 pounds.\n              Having a positive attitude is one of the keys to making a successful change, according to Judy Zerafa, author of several books based on how people can improve their lives.She emphasized the importance of believing in yourself--and having positive habits, creative imagination, and persistence--to make change happen.\"Success in overcoming any self-defeating behavior particularly those related to health, finances, relationships and weight loss is almost guaranteed if you learn to reprogram the subconscious images in that part of the mind,\" Zerafa said in an article.", "id": "high24063.txt"}
