But have you ever thought about how to take care of four to twelve old people when you grow up and get married? This could be a problem for most Chinese youths as China is entering a new stage of an aging society.\nAn aging society refers to one where 10 percent or more of its population is over 60. By the end of 2007, Chinese over 60 years old have made up 11.7 percent of the nation's total population. \"China is getting old before becoming rich,\"said Cai Chuang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The population increase that has powered Chinese growth for three decades will give way over the next ten years to a rapid aging of the society. This will lead to weaker economic growth, because of a lack of labor resources.\nAs a result of the family planning policy, it is expected that the country's total working population will decrease after 2015.\nChina is not the only country getting old. More that 60 countries have become aging societies and one in three people in the European Union is a senior citizen.\nHowever, experts said that China doesn't have a highly developed social security network to support the old. Social security is an insurance program protecting those in need, including the old, the disabled and others.", "id": "high867.txt"}
