In fact, going travel does not simply mean pursuing fashion or widening vision. It is a kind of social experience and dynamic learning. Furthermore, it is a process of expanding cognition  and understanding society and life, and especially has advantages and charm in increasing knowledge and widening vision.\n    The ancient people not only mentioned \"traveling a thousand miles\" and \"reading a thousand books\" together but also regarded them as the necessary course of perfecting personality and making progress. Going travel can widen the life path and give it new social meanings and spirits of the time, making it socialized, popular, industrialized and fashionable.\n    Under these circumstances, special efforts should be made to bring culture back to tourism and have culture conveyed in tourism. By doing so, the soul of tourism will be helpful for people to learn and think. In this way, tourists can combine relaxations and joys with learning and thinking, and improve their minds while visiting historic relics.\n    Once tourism departs from culture, it will be stuck in vulgarity  and shallowness, and make it difficult to develop tourism. Some tourist cities and spots are so commercialized that people are put in no mood for the enjoyment of cultural and historic flavors of ancient buildings. Furthermore, in some places, historic and natural relics are decreasing, while more and more artificial scenes and antiques   block the view of real scenes and mislead people with false information and historic relics.\n    Culture is the core of tourism. Taking back the culture as the soul provides the right way for the development of tourism, and the build-up of spiritual home and social civilization.", "id": "high19417.txt"}
