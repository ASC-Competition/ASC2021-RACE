But for Jacque Stroobants, the statue is up there with the best of them.\n    \"I'm proud of him. People come from all around the world to see him,\" says 60-year-old Stroobants with a fatherly glance at the little boy.\n    As the most famous landmark of Brussels, Manneken Pis has a very special place in the heart of Belgians.\n    The original Manneken Pis dates back to 1388, but the statue tourists see today dates from 1619 when the city built a second one after the original was destroyed.\n    Many stories go round Manneken Pis. Nobody knows why he was made. One story is that he saved Brussels by putting out the flames of a deadly fire with his well-aimed pis. But the most believable story is that the boy, the son of a wealthy man, was kidnapped  . The father had a statue built in honor of the way his son was found - peeing against a tree.\n    Perhaps best-known for his naked beauty, the \"peeing boy\" has also been clothed in some of the finest clothes money can buy.\n    Stroobants has been changing his clothes for the last 29 years. On average, he has clothes on 300 days a year. And on special days, he pees beer. \n    A few of the ways he's been dressed are: a football player, Mozart and an army general. Now, he has more than 600 pieces of clothes.\n    There is no strict charge for those wishing to provide clothes for the little boy. But certain condition must be met. \"The clothes cannot include either advertising or political message.\" said Stroobants, because they would cheapen the national treasure.\n    But Manneken Pis is still something local people can make money from--by selling all kinds of souvenirs.", "id": "high20920.txt"}
