It predicts the number of cancer cases will reach 24 million a year by 2035, but half could be prevented. The WHO said there was now a \"real need\" to focus on cancer prevention by cutting down smoking, obesity and drinking.\n    The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) said there was an \"alarming\" level of ignorance about diet's role in cancer. Fourteen million people a year are diagnosed with cancer, but that is predicted to increase to 19 million by 2025, 22 million by 2030 and 24 million by 2035. The developing world will bear the worst of the extra cases. \nDr Chris Wild, the director of the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer, told the BBC: \"The global cancer burden is increasing quite markedly, due predominately to the ageing of the populations and population growth. If we look at the cost of treatment of cancers, it is spiralling out of control, even for the high-income countries. Prevention is  ly critical and it's been somewhat neglected.\"\n    The WHO's World Cancer Report 2014 said the major sources of preventable cancer included: smoking; infections; alcohol; obesity and inactivity; radiation, both from the sun and medical scans; Air pollution and other environmental factors; delayed parenthood, having fewer children and not breastfeeding.\nFor most countries, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. However, cervical cancer dominates in large parts of Africa. \nOne of the report's editors, Dr Bernard Stewart from the University of New South Wales in Australia, said prevention had a \"crucial role in fighting the tidal wave of cancer which we see coming across the world\". He said human behaviour was behind many cancers such as the sunbathe \"until you're cooked evenly on both sides\" approach in his native Australia. There was a similar argument to be had with sugar fuelling obesity, which in turn affected cancer risk.\nMeanwhile, a survey of 2,046 people in the UK by the WCRF suggested 49% do not know that diet increases the risk of developing cancer. A third of people said cancer was mainly due to family history, but the charity said no more than 10% of cancers were down to inherited genes.\nAmanda McLean, general manager for the WCRF, said: \"It's very alarming to see that such a large number of people don't know that there's a lot they can do to significantly reduce their risk of getting cancer. In the UK, about a third of the most common cancers could be prevented through being a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet and being regularly physically active.\"\n\"People can cut their risk of cancer by making healthy lifestyle choices, but it's important to remember that the government and society are also responsible for creating an environment that supports healthy lifestyles.\"", "id": "high18114.txt"}
