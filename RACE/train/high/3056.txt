He constantly advertised for hired hands. Most people were not willing to work on farms along the Atlantic because they worried about the terrible storms that destroy buildings and crops. The farmer received a steady stream of refusals at the interview for a farmhand\nFinally, a short, thin man approached the farmer. \"Are you a good farmhand?\" the farmer asked him.\n\"Well, I can sleep when the wind blows. \" answered the little man.\nAlthough puzzled by this answer ,the farmer, desperate for help, hired him. The little man worked well around the farm ,busy from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work.\nThen one night the wind howled loudly from offshore. Jumping out of bed,the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and yelled, \" Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they are blown away! \"\nThe little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, \"No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows. \"\nEnraged  by the response, the farmer was tempted to fire  him on the spot ,Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his amazement,he discovered that all of the hay had been covered. The cows were in the bam,the chickens were in the coops,and the doors were barred The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down, Nothing could be blown away.\nThe farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he also returned to his bed to sleep while the wind was still blowing.", "id": "high3056.txt"}
