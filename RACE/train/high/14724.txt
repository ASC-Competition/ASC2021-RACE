Far too many.\nThis is Life, all right, but we do treat it like a rehearsal and, unhappily, we do miss so many of its best moments.\nWe take jobs to stay alive and provide homes for our families, always making ourselves believe that this style of life is only a temporary state of affairs along the road to what we really want to do. Then, at 60 or 65, we are suddenly given a clock and several grandchildren and we look back and realize that all those years waiting for Real Life to come along were in fact real life.\nIn America they have a saying much laughedat by the English: \"Have a nice day.\" They speak slowly and seriously in their shops, hotels and sandwich bars. I think it is a wonderful phrase, making us remember, in effect, to enjoy the moment: to value this very day.\nHow often do we say to ourselves \"I'll take up horse-riding(or golf, or sailing)as soon as I get a greater job.\" But only to do none of those things when we do get the higher position.\nWhen I first became a reporter I knew a man who gave up a very well-paid respectable job at Daily Telegraph to go and work for a small weekly newspaper.
