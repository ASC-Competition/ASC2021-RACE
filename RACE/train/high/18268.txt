They could not believe what had just happened.\nMariam was Sarah's best friend. They had spent the entire day drawing and painting. Sarah's mother had gone to the market to buy some goodies and the two friends were alone at home. Sarah decided to show her friend a very expensive vase that her father had gifted her mother on their wedding anniversary  . She took her friend to the drawing room and carefully removed the vase. She knew it was not allowed by her mother but she wanted to show off a bit.\nMariam looked at the vase with wonder. When she was giving back the vase to Sarah, a disaster happened. The vase slipped between their fingers and fell on the floor with a crash.\n\"Oh no!\" cried Sarah in panic. \"What shall I do now? Mother will be so angry.\" Mariam felt equally guilty  . \"I know! Let us sweep up the pieces and hide them. Mother will not know that I have broken it.\"\n\"But she will ask when she sees it missing. What will we say then?\" Mariam asked. \"I think the best thing would be to own up  .\"\nSarah took a deep breath. \"You are right.\"\nWhen Sarah's mother came back, Sarah and Mariam poured out their tale. At first, her mother looked angry. Then she saw how unhappy and guilty they both looked. She hugged them both tightly. \"I am so glad you were brave enough to own up, Sarah. I am very upset about the vase but I am happy you are both such truthful girls.\"\n\"It was Mariam's idea that we should own up, Mother,\" Sarah added honestly.\nThe girls laughed. They felt as if a huge load had been taken off their shoulders.", "id": "high18268.txt"}
