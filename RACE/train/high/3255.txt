The different colors were created by adding no, little or lots of milk to each cup of black coffee.\nThe recreated Mona Lisa measured 20 feet long and 13 feet wide. It took a team of eight people three hours to complete the work. It was created for The Rocks Aroma Festival in Sydney, Australia, and seen by 130,000 people who attended the one-day coffee-lovers event.\nElaine Kelly, one of the organizers from the Sydney Harbor Foreshore Authority, was delighted with the result. She said, \"Each coffee cup was filled with varying amounts of milk to create the different shades  of the painting. We wanted to create an element of surprise and a sense of fun in the way we communicated with the public.\"\n\"Once we had the idea of creating an image  out of coffee cups we searched for something iconic to reproduce .And after some time we chose the most iconic painting in history. The Mona Lisa has been reproduced so many times in so many different mediums but, as far as we know, never out of coffee,\" Kelly continued. \"Besides, the idea is practical.\"\n\"It was fantastic. It really looked like the famous painting--the Mona Lisa. It was wonderful,\" said one visitor.\nAfter much planning it was great to see it coming together so well and the 130,000 people who attended the event certainly enjoyed it and were deeply attracted by it,\" said Kelly.", "id": "high3255.txt"}
