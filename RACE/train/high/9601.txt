Before midnight on Thursday, in malls across the US, people start queuing up outside the locked entrances of stores, making longer and longer lines, holding coupons  , sipping coffee and hot chocolate, rubbing their hands and stamping   their feet for warmth, excitedly chatting, and waiting for the clerks to open the door when the time arrives.\nBlack Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, which fell on Nov 28,2014, \"has become in recent decades a special American holiday\", said the International Business Times. Indeed, up to 147 million Black Friday shoppers were expected to put up with the dark of night and the elbows of other shoppers so that they could bring home some bargains, according to the US National Retail Federation.\nBut why does the shopping festival have such a name?\nThe name was first used in Philadelphia in the 1970s. The streets and sidewalks of the city became so packed with traffic and crowds on the day after Thanksgiving Day that the local police did not look forward to it. Because of this, they called the day \"Black Friday\", said The Huffington Post. However, others believe that Black Friday takes its name from the fact that because of the increase in sales on the day, shops are able for the first time in the year to move out of the \"red\" - that is, debt - and into the \"black\", or profit. Businesses, of course, try to take advantage of this day. A decade ago, retailers   opened at 5 or 6 am. Now, many of the big stores open at midnight.\nPeople really seem to like the whole experience of queuing up before midnight, \"for it isn't just about the bargains\", noted CNN. \"For many shoppers, it's just fun to be part of a large crowd. Those who go to the malls at midnight are driven by the same thing that makes a million people get together in Times Square each New Year's Eve.\"", "id": "high9601.txt"}
