In the daytime I ran by her side and at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot, we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees and when it was cold, we had a nice warm wooden house. As soon as I was old enough to eat grass, my mother used to go out to work during the daytime and come back in the evening.\nThere were six young colts  in the field besides me; they were older than I; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run with them, and had great fun; we used to gallop  all together in the field. Sometimes we had rather play rough, for others would frequently bite, kick as well as gallop.\nOne day, when there was a good deal of kicking, my mother came to me and said, \"I expect you to pay attention to what I am going to say. The colts who live here are very good colts, but they are cart horse colts, and of course they have not learned manners. You have been well-bred and well-born. I hope you will grow up gentle and good, and never learn bad ways. I hope you do your work with a good will, lift your feet up well when you move quickly, and never bite or kick.\"\nI have never forgotten my mother's advice. I knew she was a wise old horse, and our master thought a great deal of her. Her name was Duchess, but he often called her Pet.\nOur master gave us good food; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him. When my mother saw him at the gate, she would neigh  with joy. He would pat and touch her and say, \"Well, Pet, how is your little Darkie?\" Then he would give me a piece of bread and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother.  _ \nThere was a plowboy, Dick, who sometimes came into our field to pick blackberries. When he had eaten all he wanted, he would throw stones and sticks at us. We did not much mind him, for we could gallop  off; but sometimes a stone would hurt us.\nOne day he was at this game. Our master saw what was going on, so he jumped and caught Dick by the arm, giving him a box  on the ear.\n\"Bad boy!\" he said, \"this shall be the last time. Get away; I shall not want you on my farm again.\" So we never saw Dick any more. Old Daniel, the man who looked after the horses, was just as gentle as our master, so we were well off.", "id": "high20569.txt"}
