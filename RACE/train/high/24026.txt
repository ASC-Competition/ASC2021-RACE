Students bring their own lunches and eat in the classroom with their teachers.\nAt first, I didn't think I needed to be \"on\" during lunch, since it was technically a free time for students. However, I was surprised to learn that even in a classroom with fewer students, social segregation   happened. The entire class crowded around a table just to avoid one or two other students sitting by themselves on the other side of the room. Students refer to one as the \"cool\" one and another as the \"loser\". There were only three tables.\nAfter witnessing this, I made a new classroom rule. Every day at lunch, we would put all the tables together and everyone including me would sit around the big table. Students could sit wherever they wanted at the table. This way, no one was excluded from the group.\nAt first, there was much grumbling at this. But gradually the complaining stopped. Students who didn't usually talk to each other during free time started to share conversations. Students were occasionally requested to bring something for others to taste. This started a new tradition: weekly food sharing.\nIn other situations, students make unpleasant comments about their classmate's food, but not during these lunches. Students were careful to thank the sharer, even if they didn't like the offering. Many students tried a food they had never tried before and some cooked a family recipe with their parents for the first time.\nEating together gave us the opportunity to practice social graces  . Students learned to ask about and respect each other's food choices. They also gained knowledge about their classmates' lives and cultures by tasting each other's food and practicing open-mindedness.", "id": "high24026.txt"}
