There are priority medicines that have not been adapted for children's use or are not available when needed,\" said Dr Hans, the U.N. agency's director of medicines policy and standards.\nMedicines that need to be adapted to children's needs include many antibiotics, pain drugs as well as combination pills for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\nThe agency is building an Internet entrance linking to clinical trials carried out in children and will launch a Web site with the information early next year.\nTesting medicines on children has always been a controversial issue, since good ethical practice requires informed agreement from people participating in clinical trials, which is difficult to obtain in the case of children.\nAs a result, research-based drug companies have been _ of developing child-friendly medicines and general companies have been slow to produce them at lower cost.\nIn an attempt to deal with the issue, both Europe and the United States now have special rules offering extended patent protection for drugs that have been tested on children.", "id": "high3268.txt"}
