The prizes are ultimately funded by the taxpayer, through school budgets. Nearly 500 secondary schools, one in six, have decided to take part in the scheme, which is intended to replace old-style rewards such as stickers and golden stars.\nBut the extent of rewards being offered in schools brought a warning that a generation of children is growing up expecting to be rewarded at every stage. Many youngsters are collecting points for ordinary achievements such as remembering to bring their PE kit and wearing the correct uniform.\nUnder the scheme, teachers award Vivo points--worth 1 penny each--according to the school's policy. Schools typically spendPS4 toPS6 on prizes per pupil each year, although some commit considerably more. Most pupils accumulate between 400 and 600 Vivos a year. Vivo Miles insists it is \"pretty rare\" for a pupil to accumulate enough points to buy an iPod, which requires 3,100 Vivos.\nBut Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the scheme amounted to \"bribery\". \"It misleads children into thinking anything which requires effort has to have a special reward,\" he said. \"This 'all must have prizes' view is damaging to children in the long-term.\" The scheme amounted to an \"admission of failure\" by schools. He said. \"It shows a school has failed to convince children education is important.\"", "id": "high2253.txt"}
