He expressed his concern to the nurse that some children might be made fun of his child. A doctor examined the baby and reassured the new dad that his son was healthy---- the ears presented only a small problem with its appearance.\nBut the nervous father continued. He wondered if the child might suffer psychological effects of ridicule, or if they should consider plastic surgery . The nurse assured him that it was really no problem, and he should just wait to see if the boy grows into his ears.\nThe father finally felt more optimistic about his child, but now he worried about his wife's reaction to those large ears. She had been delivered by operation, and had not yet seen the child.\n\"She doesn't take things as easily as I do,\" he said to the nurse.\nBy this time, the new mother was settled in the recovery room and ready to meet her new baby. The nurse went along with the dad to lend some support in case this inexperienced mother became upset about her baby's large ears.\nThe baby was in a blanket  with his head covered for the short trip through the cold air-conditioned corridor. The baby was placed in his mother's arms, who eased the blanket back so that she could look at her child for the first time.\nShe took one look at her baby's face and looked to her husband and gasped, \"Oh, Honey! Look! He has your ears!\"\nNo problem with Mom. She married those ears...and she loves the man to whom _ are attached.\nThe poet Kahlil Gibran said, \"Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart.\" It's hard to see the ears when you're looking into the light.", "id": "high608.txt"}
