Kim Bard of the University of Portsmouth in England and her colleagues carried out a study on 46 baby chimpanzees orphans , which had lost their mothers. The study showed that primate babies that have tight relationships with mother figures do much better on cognitive  ( ) tests than babies who only grew up with peers   , but this is not breaking news. In fact, it ' s old news.\n      In the 1950s, Harry Harlow did a series of experiments with baby monkeys that showed. that lack of love and comfort makes for a crazy monkey.\n      Harlow constructed a cage that included a wire monkey  \"mother\" with a plastic face. Then he equipped the  \"mother\" with a milk bottle .The cage also had another wire \"mother\" who was covered with soft cloth. The baby monkeys spent all their time with the cloth \"mother\" arid only went to the wire \"mother\" to feed.\nHarlow's monkey experiment was important because, at the time, child care experts, and everybody's grandmother had a  \"no touch, no comfort\" policy toward children. They advised parents not to respond to crying babies. They thought that babies should sleep alone to become independent, and for God's sake put that kid down.\n      But Harlow's work changed that policy. Mothers were soon permitted to have their babies next to them in the hospital.\n     The current chimp research based on Harlow's work shows that mother's love doesn't just make for a psychologically  healthy child, it also makes for a smart child. \n     The highly raised chimps do better than those that are not loved, and the well-raised chimps do even better than human kids on IQ tests.\n     We are primates, social animals which need love. We need to be held and talked to and made to feel that at least one person wants to be with us all the time.", "id": "high18374.txt"}
