She did not know them but invited them in. \"We do not go into a house together,\" they replied. And she asked why.\nOne of the old men explained: \"His name is Wealth,\" pointing to one of his friends, \"and he is Success, and I am Love.\" Then he added, \"Now go in and discuss with your husband which one of us you want in your home.\"\nThe woman went in and told her husband what had happened. Her husband was overjoyed. \"How nice!\" he said. \"Since that is the case, let Wealth come in and fill our home with wealth!\" His wife disagreed, \"My dear, why not invite Success?\" Their daughter-in-law gave her own suggestion: \"Wouldn't it be better to invite Love? Our home will be filled with love then.\" \"Let's _ our daughter-in-law's advice,\" said the husband to his wife. \"Go out and invite Love to be our guest.\"\nLove got up and started walking toward the house. The other two also got up and followed him. Surprised, the woman asked Wealth and Success, \"I only invited Love, why are you coming in?\"\nThe old men replied together. \"If you had invited Wealth or Success, the other two of us would have stayed out. But since you invited Love, wherever he goes, we go with him. Wherever there is Love, there is also Wealth and Success!\"", "id": "high9201.txt"}
