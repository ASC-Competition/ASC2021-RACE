As we walked toward the entrance to the restaurant, a man with a dirty face jumped up from a chair, opened the door for us and greeted us in a friendly way.\nOnce inside, my daughters said in a low voice, \"Mom, he smells.\" After we ordered our lunch, I explained, telling the kids to look beyond the dirt. Seeing this rudeness truly upset me, I wanted to set a good example to my children, but sometimes being a good example was difficult. When our meal arrived, I realized I had left the car-sick pills in the truck. With the windiest trip ahead, the kids needed them, so Iwent back to the car for them.\nJust then, the \"doorman\" was opening the door for me, I said a loud \"thank you\" to him as I exited.\nWhen I returned, we talked a bit. He said he was not allowed inside unless he bought food. I went back and told my family his situation. Then I asked our waitress to add one soup and sandwich. The kids looked puzzled, but when I said the order was for the \"doorman\", they smiled. When it was time to continue our trip, I noticed the \"doorman\" enjoying his meal. Upon seeing me, he stood up and thanked me heartily. He then lifted his hand for a handshake and I gratefully accepted. I suddenly noticed the tears in his eyes-tears of gratitude  . What happened next drew great astonishment: I gave the \"doorman\" a hug.\nBack in truck, I fell into deep thought. While we can't choose many things in life, we can choose when to show gratitude. I said thanks to a man who had simply helped open a door for me, and also said thanks for that opportunity to teach my children by example.", "id": "high8739.txt"}
