They weigh only about eighty pounds each.\nIn spite of their small size, they are the best hunters among all the jungle people. Even the great elephant can be caught by them.\nSince they do not plant any crops, Pygmies are constantly moving around. They seldom sleep in one camp for more than a few days. In their camps there is not furniture at all except for some weapons such as spears, bows and arrows. There are no cooking pots either. Food is eaten uncooked or smoked over a lire. So when the tribe moves to a new camp there is nothing to carry except these weapons and babies too small to walk.\nPymies can move on the tree tops almost as skillfully as monkeys. Often they travel great distances through the branches without touching the ground.\nOne of the surprising facts about these small men and women is their great appetite . A Pygmy can eat up sixty bananas at a single meal besides quantities of meat. After eating, they will lie on their hard earth bed and groan in all night. But in the morning, they are ready to eat the same amount of food or fight among themselves.", "id": "high1965.txt"}
