We've really had enough of you. Although we have tried to speak to you politely on several occasions, you have always answered with a stream of verbal abuse .\nEver since you moved in three months ago, you have shown very little consideration for the other residents of this building, though many residents expressed their unhappiness with you. For the past six weekends, you have held very noisy parties, which have not finished until early the next morning. As you know, most of the people here are elderly or have very young children, and the noise keeps them awake all night. You don't have to be so noisy, do you? Last weekend the situation _ when two of your friends fought with each other on the first floor. The fighting was so bad that the police had to be called. What's more, your friends left the stairs in a terrible state --- they even broke two windows on their way out! We feel that we can't bear this type of act.\nWe strongly demand that you pay for this damage to the window soon. If you don't and you carry on being a nuisance . We will kick you out! Legal steps will be taken if necessary.\nYours sincerely", "id": "high1906.txt"}
