The conclusion was based on 490 sets of adult skeletal  remains from an archaeological  site in northeastern England , YC dating from the 9th century to about 1850 .\nAbout 55% of men and 73% of women died before the age of 45, and 39% of men and 56% of women died before age 30. The risk of death before age 30 declined as bone length increased.\n\"This study provides evidence from an archaeological sample that long bone length is connected with age at death--those with smaller bones tend to die younger,\" according to Dr. D.J. Gunnell of the university of Bristol  in the UK and colleagues .\nWhile it is not clear why short stature  might be linked to earlier death , the researchers point out that height is _ of childhood nutrition, which may have long-lasting effect on health .\n\"Mechanism   for height-mortality  associations in the past may differ from those today , for example , short stature may have increased the risk of death in childbirth and this may explain the higher risk of premature  mortality in women,\" Gunnell and colleagues write .\n\"However, short bones, it would appear, have always been a marker of a short life,\" the authors conclude.", "id": "high3431.txt"}
