Even though he was a great teacher, he seemed rather like a character out of a horror movie. He didn't look that bad, but somehow, he looked extremely scary to me.\nSome kids began to believe that he was a murderer or a ghost; some believed he was mad and a few believed that he might have suffered a lot in his life. I was one of those 'few'.\nOne day I gathered up my courage and headed towards the school garden. He was, as usual, sitting on a bench alone. I breathed heavily a few times and then walked towards him.\n\"How are you?\" I asked with my voice crackling.\nHe managed to say, \"Fine.\"\n\"Well, good to know,\" I tried to be happy.\n\"Hmmm...\" was all I heard.\n\"What's up with you?\" then seeing a puzzled look on his face, I tried to be more formal and respectful. \"I mean, why aren't you like all other people in the school?

You see, if you tell me your problem, you will have a light heart and you will have the feeling that someone somewhere cares about you.\"\n\"Oh okay, that was a very nice belief indeed; let's take a walk and I will let you know everything.\"\nSoon after our little talk, there was a visible change on his face. Later that day in the class, there was a smile on his face.", "id": "high23256.txt"}
