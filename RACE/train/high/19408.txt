With the number of people visiting this place increasing each year, the chances are great that any of us may damage the natural environment along the Trail and affect the experience for others. So please do your part by following these hiking and camping practices, and encourage others to learn about and adopt these techniques.\n1 Plan ahead and prepare.\nEvaluate the risks associated with your outing, identify campsites and destinations in advance, and use maps and guides. Prepare for extreme weather, dangers, and emergencies - especially the cold - to avoid impacts   from searches, rescues, and campfires. Learn when areas are most crowded and try to avoid those times.\n2 Dispose of waste properly.\nPack out all trash and food waste, including that left behind by others. Don't bury trash or food, and don't try to burn packaging materials in campfires. Use the privy   for human waste only. Do not add trash. If there is no privy, dispose of human waste by burying it in a hole, a hole at least 200 feet (80 steps) from campsites, water sources and shelters, and well away from trails.\n3 Leave what you find.\nLeave plants, cultural artifacts   and other natural objects where you found them for others to enjoy. Do not damage live trees or plants; green wood burns poorly. Collect only firewood that is dead, down, and no larger than your wrist. Leave dead standing trees and dead limbs on standing trees for the wildlife.\n4 Minimize campfire impacts.\nUse stoves for cooking - if you need a fire, build one only where it's legal and in an existing fire ring. Keep fires small. Never leave your campfire unattended, and drown it when you leave. Do not try to burn trash, including plastic, glass, cans, tea bags, food, or anything with food on it. These items do not burn thoroughly. They create harmful fumes  , and attract wildlife like skunks and bears.", "id": "high19408.txt"}
