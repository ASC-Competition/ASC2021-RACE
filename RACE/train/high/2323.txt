Green collars say no when work is life and life is work. They choose to get out of the fast lane , and explore new ways of living \"green\".\nLiving green doesn't mean someone is working as an environmentalist, biologist or scientist. Instead it is more of a lifestyle choice. A typical green collar is well educated like a white-collar but physically tough like a blue-collar, likely born in the 70s or 80s of the last century and living in one of China's big cities, with a monthly income well above 5,000 yuan (about US $700).\nThe life of a green collar may go something like this; Turn off the mobile phone after work, eat only healthy food rich in vitamins, go on hikes every weekend, and like to help _ \nGreen collars even have their own club. In Beijing, the Green Collar Club is for people who share a \"be happy, healthy and helpful\" spirit.

They have a lot of money, but do not fall slave to it.\" said Zuo Shiguang, one of the founding members of the club.", "id": "high2323.txt"}
