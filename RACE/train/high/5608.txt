She called the cabin crew attendant over to complain  about her seat. \"What seems to be the problem, Madam?\" asked the attendant.\n\"Can't you see?\" She said, \"You have seated me next to a black person! I can't possibly sit next to this kind of person. Find me another seat!\"\n\"Please calm down, Madam,\" the stewardess replied. \"The flight is very full today, but I will tell you what I will do---- I will go and check to see if we have any seats available  in club or first class.\"\nThe woman glanced at the angry black man beside her. A few minutes later, the stewardess returned with the good news, which she delivered to the lady.\n\"Madam, unfortunately, as I expected, economy is full. I have spoken to the cabin services director, and club is also full. However, we do have one seat in first class.\"\nBefore the lady had a chance to answer, the stewardess continued, \"It is most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade, however, and I have had to get special permission from the captain. But, learning this condition, the captain felt that it was shocking that someone should be forced to sit next to such a tiring person.\"\nHaving said that, the stewardess turned to the black man sitting next to the lady, and said, \"So if you'd like to get you things, sir, I have your seat ready for you...\"\nAt this point, obviously the surrounding passengers stood and gave an applause while the black man walked up to the front of the plane.", "id": "high5608.txt"}
