From this starting-point we might hear the expression, \"He gets my back up!\" meaning \"He makes me angry.\"\n  In the same manner, we know that many animals, if challenged by attackers, will not turn and run away because this will encourage the attacker to attack them more forcefully. Instead, they will move backwards slowly to get out of harm's way, always still facing their attacker.We call this action \" _ \" and it can be used just as well with humans as with animals.\n  In the case of humans, however, the back-off may not be physical but oral, as in using a kinder tone of voice and gentler words instead of fighting against the attackers.", "id": "high21052.txt"}
