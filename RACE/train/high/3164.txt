When you argue with intelligence, when you postpone acting according to understanding then there is confusion, the brain gets confused.\nThe voice of understanding, the voice of intelligence has insecurity about it. How do you know that it is the right thing?\nSo we tend to ignore it. Instead we accept authority. We obey.\nBut the brain cannot be orderly, competent, accurate and precise if you do not listen to it, if you have no respect. We are so busy with the outside world and its force that the world that is inside us does not command that respect and reverence  , that care and concern from us.\nSo one has to be a disciple   of one's own understanding, and look upon that understanding as the master.\nSometimes one may commit a mistake, it might be the whim   of the ego and we might mistake the whim, the wish of the ego for the voice of silence and intelligence, but that we have to discover. Unless you commit mistakes, how do you learn to discriminate between the false and the true? In learning there is bound to be a little insecurity, a possibility of committing mistakes. Why should one be terribly afraid of committing mistakes?\nSo instead of accepting the authority of habits and conditionings, while one is moving one watches, and when there is a suggestion, do not neglect, ignore, or insult the whisper from within and from one's own intelligence.", "id": "high3164.txt"}
