Obviously. The fact seemed so mind-blowing obvious that it wasn't really discussed. We could see ourselves in the mirror, we could feel pain and pleasure, we could think thoughts for ourselves and, more importantly, perhaps, all the world's main religions assumed that we do exist. So we exist.\nNo you don't it!\nYou don't exist. That's because it's impossible to show once and for all that you do. There's no proof. You might think you exist-that you are sitting at a table reading this book, for instance-but how could you show with 100 percent certainty that this is true? There's no experiment that could prove it. Although Descartes said just you could prove your own existence by the fact that you are able to think, this isn't actually, according to the British philosopher A. J. Ayer. Just because we know that we are thinking, this doesn't mean that there is a \"you\" doing the thinking. It just shows that the thoughts are happening, not that anyone is having them. Thoughts exists, \"You\" don't.\n _ !\nWhat a waste of time this question is. Although you can argue until the end of time whether you exist or not, it doesn't get you anywhere. Unless you forget about this unanswerable question, you'll be stuck thinking about it forever, and that isn't of any use to anyone. Move on. Think about something more important! This very roughly, is the view of almost all philosophers, who prefer to answer other, apparently more useful, questions.\nYes, but...\nYou exist, but not in the way you might think. According to the great French philosopher Ren Descartes, you can't show that anything exists--apart from your own self. The existence of the entire world can be doubted in one way or another, but the facts you're having thoughts shows that there might be something (that's you) having them. This let Descartes to write the famous philosophical phrase, \" I think before I am\".", "id": "high10293.txt"}
