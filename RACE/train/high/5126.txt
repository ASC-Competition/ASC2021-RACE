Psychologists tell us that nothing controls our lives more than our self-image. We live like the person we see in the mirror. We are what we think we are. If you don't think you'll be successful, you won't. You can't be it if you can't see it. Your life is limited to your vision. If you want to change your life, you must change your vision of your life.\nArnold Schwarzenegger was not that famous in 1976 when he met with a newspaper reporter. The reporter asked Schwarzenegger: \"Now that you've retired from bodybuilding, what do you plan to do next?\" Schwarzenegger answered very calmly and confidently: \"I'm going to be the No. 1 movie star in Hollywood.\" The reporter was shocked and amused at Schwarzenegger's plan.

Schwarzenegger became the No. 1 highest paid movie star in Hollywood. Remember: \"If you can see it, you can be it.\"\nThere's a successful businessman who often wears a shirt with these words on it: \" _ ! \" you only get one life to live, so why not live the best life possible? So you can be fully satisfied at what you see and get.", "id": "high5126.txt"}
