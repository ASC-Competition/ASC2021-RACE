I went up with an instructor, floated and flew above the waves for about 20 minutes, then landed on the sand. His wife was there to meet us so she could drive us back. Their son, about 8 years old, was with her. As the four of us were standing there a woman named Sue came up with a big smile. She gave a warm hello to the couple, and then asked the boy, \"How's school, mate ?\"With a troubled look on his young face, the boy quietly said, \"Not good.\" In response Sue exclaimed  ,sounding surprised , \"Not good ?I bet it is fun.\"\nThen she turned her attention back to the boy's parents. They started talking about some of their friends, smiling and laughing . Meanwhile, all three of them completely ignored the boy . But I watched his head drop.I watched him turn away from the group, take a few steps ,and just stand there ,alone.\nI still find it hard to believe that anyone could miss a child's reaction that completely. I wondered how the three adults could stand there and laugh while that boy stood there alone, troubled not only about school but also that no one was interested in his troubles. \nMaybe his father tried to distract  his son with risky sports. As long as you are active, you can't feel your emotional  pain. But what if his son is not interested in sports?\nThese were what most people would say are \"good parents\" . But I say that what they did was child abuse. It was total emotional neglect at that moment . And that is why I am writing this story. To remind everyone that it is little interactions  with children that make a difference in their lives and in society.", "id": "high17069.txt"}
