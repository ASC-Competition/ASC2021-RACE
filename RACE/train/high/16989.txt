There was a doll on one side of the room,and a bookcase full of books on the other -- they had heard I loved reading. Mom had also prepared a keyboard for me,since she knew that I played the piano.\nMy life in the family did not go so well at first. Because I am the only child in my family in China,I was not used to having two younger kids -- Zachary and Grace--running around me yelling   all the time.\nMom had a serious talk with me about this problem on a Sunday afternoon. She told me,\"You can't just come home from school every day,go to your room and do your homework. You need to be a part of this family. You need to play with my kids for at least an hour. \" This rule was very annoying at first. I did not have much experience playing with children.\nHowever,the more time I spent with the kids,the more I grew to love them. We played games and read books together. I even taught them Chinese. Thanks to Mom's rule,I began to feel like I was really part of the family.\nMom also inspired me to live a healthier life. She got up early every morning to go running. On weekends,she took the whole family to visit parks or go camping.\nI did not like sports much when I was back home,but now I love to join all kinds of sports. I am healthier and more confident too.\nWith my American family,I found joy and laughter. I learned to live with energy and optimism  ,thanks to the care and responsibility of my loving American parents.", "id": "high16989.txt"}
