People love Pluto. Children identify with its smallness. Adults felt it hard to accept its isolated existence.\"\nMany people felt sorry about Pluto's demotion . \"I just cannot accept this at this time,\" says Liu Ming, 29, who runs a small company in prefix = st1 /Shanghai. \"I was taught that 'the Nine Great Planets' formed our solar system since primary school. And now they suddenly decrease the planets to eight. This will take some time for most of us to absorb it,\" says Liu.\nOrdinary people are simply not used to it, but for some professionals, especially the persons in charge of planetariums  and educators, the change has become a real headache. The \"eight instead of nine\" change will affect thousands of planetariums around the world. Schools will also be greatly affected.\n      InChina, teachers are anxious as outdated textbooks are printed and given out to the remotest corner of the country for school children ready to start a new term soon. According to the Ministry of Education, new textbooks with changed contents will not be available until next year.\nZhao Zhiheng, a member of the Astronomy Association from Tianjin, suggested that primary and middle school teachers be trained in the improved knowledge, and that the media carry more stories to let people know about the change as soon as possible.", "id": "high17177.txt"}
