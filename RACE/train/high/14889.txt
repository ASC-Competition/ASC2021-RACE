And they often deepen into significant achievement gaps by the end of eighth grade if they are not dealt with during elementary school.\nThe findings suggest that, in order for the United States to maintain  long-term scientific and economic competitiveness in the world, policymakers need to renew efforts to ensure access(n.,) to high-quality, early learning experiences in childcare settings, preschools and elementary schools.\nThe researchers' study tracked 7,757 children from their start in kindergarten to the end of eighth grade. Researchers found that, among kindergarteners with low levels of general knowledge, 62 percent were struggling in science by the time they reached third grade and 54 percent were struggling in that subject in eighth grade. And general knowledge gaps between minorities and Whites were already large at the time when students began kindergarten.\n\"Children growing up in low-income families typically experience comparatively fewer early opportunities to learn about the natural and social sciences,\" the authors wrote. \"Their parents often have lower educational levels and therefore less science knowledge themselves as well as fewer resources available to direct the children's academic growth. Children raised in poverty often attend poorly resourced schools that futher limit their academic opportunities.\"\nMorgan said that, within families, parents who regularly talk and interact with toddlers  can point out and explain physical, natural and social events occurring around them daily. This might help youngsters learn facts and concepts that will prepare them to take better advantage of science instruction they receive during elementary and middle school.", "id": "high14889.txt"}
