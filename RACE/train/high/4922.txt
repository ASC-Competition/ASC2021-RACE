But native speakers can be hard to find. If you're having trouble communicating in English, American situation comedies are one good way to help.\nThey can not only give you a lot of information about American culture, but also offer some useful daily expressions. Watching them will help you enlarge your vocabulary and teach you correct language usage in different situations. Best of all, situation comedies are a fun way to learn.\nThe Apprentice\nThe American reality   TV show is hosted by the famous businessman Donald Trump. It's based on the idea of the final job interview for the final job. The show picks 16 people to compete for a job with Trump's business. Those who fail their weekly tasks have to meet with Trump. They have to explain why they should not be fired  .\nThe Apprentice is useful for English students who want to learn how to make up a persuasive   argument. For example, rather than say \"I think I did a good job\", one may also learn to throw off the possibility of uncertainty by saying, \"I did a good job.\"\nDesperate Housewives (DH)\nDesperate Housewives is set in an invented American town, Wisteria Lane. It follows a group of middle-aged women as they go through their daily family lives. But in fact, those women live a life of lies, secrets, criminal   acts, and mystery.\nThis program is good at expressing the funny life of American neighbors. And, it's the perfect comedy series for foreign learners wanting to see how to hold a relaxed daily conversation.\nAnother reason for watching DH is to learn some expressions American families use that are not in your English language textbooks. For example, the mothers often use words such as \"sport\" and \"you guys\" to speak about their kids.", "id": "high4922.txt"}
