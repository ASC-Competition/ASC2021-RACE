With regard to helping those in difficulty generally, they found that:\n(1) women are helped more than men;\n(2) men help more than women;\n(3) attractive women are helped more than unattractive women.\nOther factors relate to the number of people in the area, whether the person is thought to be in trouble through their own fault, and whether a person sees himself as being able to help.\nAccording to Adrian Furnham, Professor of University College, London, there are three reasons why we tend to stand by doing nothing:\n(1) \"Shifting of responsibility\"-the more people there are, the less likely help is to be given. Each person excuses himself by thinking someone else will help, so that the more \"other people' there are, the greater the total shifting of responsibility.\n(2) \"'Fear of making a mistake''-situations are often not clear. People think that those involved in an accident may know each other or it may be a joke, so a fear of embarrassment makes them keep themselves to themselves.\n(3) \"Fear of the consequences if attention is turned on you, and the person is violent.\"\nLaurie Taylor, Professor of Sociology at London University, says: \"In the experiments I've seen on intervention  , much depends on the neighborhood or setting. There is a silence on public transport which is hard to break. We are embarrassed to draw attention to something that is happening, while in a football match, people get involved, and a fight would easily follow. \"\nPsychotherapist Alan Dupuy identifies the importance of the individual: \"The British as a whole have some difficulty intervening, but there are exceptional individuals in every group who are prepared to intervene, regardless of their own safety: These would be people with a strong moral code or religious ideals.\"", "id": "high15969.txt"}
