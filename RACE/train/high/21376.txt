The problem arises when it means always giving into all our children's demands--- even if they are beyond our price range or not age-appropriate.\"\nMs Calland, who runs \"Santa Says No\" style sessions with colleague Nicky Hutchinson, added: \"Many of us go into so much debt providing the gifts our children want that we spend the rest of the year paying off the bills.
