She is a founding member of Language Poets, a group in American poetry that analyzes the way language is used and raises questions to make the reader think.\nIn March, she won the National Book Critics Circle Award for \"Versed.\"\n\"This book has gotten more attention,\" Armantrout said, \"but I don't feel as if it's better.\"\nThe first half of \"Versed\" focuses on the dark forces taking hold of the United States as it fought the war against Iraq. The second half looks at the dark forces casting a shadow over her own life after Armantrout was diagnosed with cancer in 2006.\nArmantrout was shocked to learn she had won the Pulitzer but many of her colleagues were not. \"Rae Armantrout is a unique voice in American poetry,\" said Seth Lerer, head of Arts and Humanities at UCSD.\n\"Versed\", published by the Wesleyan University Press, did appear in a larger printing than her earlier works, which is about 2,700 copies. The new edition is scheduled to appear in May.", "id": "high2699.txt"}
