In the middle of so many people hurrying about their own business, a person can feel alone among the millions of others.\nThere is a popular view that in cities, strangers are less likely to help an elderly person cross a street or call the police when they see a bike being stolen.

All it takes is a funny joke or a shared interest to start a conversation with someone at a bus stop.
