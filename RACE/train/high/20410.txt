Get a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet.Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry.But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such things.So it silently began to care about your needs and never let itself grow.When mind looses its freedom to grow, creativity gets a full stop.This might be the reason why we all sometimes think \"What happens next?\", \"Why can't I think?\" \"Why am I always given the difficult, problems?\" Well, this is the result of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things.\nHunger of the mind can be actually satisfied through reading.Now why reading and not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood.Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to turn to reading.You have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all your \"How to?\" questions.The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed.Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas.\nThe same seed, if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, of which you would have never thought in your wildest dreams! This is nothing but creativity.If you read more books, your mind will open up like never before.", "id": "high20410.txt"}
