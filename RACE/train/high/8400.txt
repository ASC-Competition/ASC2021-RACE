There is, however, a catch . As you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building.\nSo a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads: Floor 1--These men have jobs. The woman reads the sign and says to herself, \"Well, that's better than my last boyfriend, but I wonder what's further up?\"\nSo up she goes. The second floor sign reads: Floor 2--These men have jobs and love kids. The woman remarks to herself, \"That's great, but I wonder what's further up?\"\nAnd up she goes again. The third floor sign reads: Floor 3--These men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good-looking. \"Hmm, better.\"\nThe fourth floor sign reads: Floor 4--These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good-looking and help with the housework. \"Wow!\" exclaims the woman, \"Very tempting. But, there must be more, further up!\"\nAnd again she heads up another flight. The fifth floor sign reads: Floor 5--These men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good-looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic character. \"Oh, mercy me! But just think...what must be awaiting me further on?\"\nSo up to the sixth floor she goes. The sixth floor sign reads: Floor 6 -You are visitor 3, 456, 789,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. Thank you for shopping Husband Mart and have a nice day.", "id": "high8400.txt"}
