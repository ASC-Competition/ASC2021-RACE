I had gone down the tower when a blind man came toward me. He kept close to the wall, touching it lightly with his arm. I stood still and looked at him walking toward the tower.\n\"What does a blind man want to climb up the tower for?\" I wondered, \"Not the view   certainly, perhaps he wants to jump. \"Thinking of this terrible reason, I thought I should follow him.\nHe went up slowly and stopped from time to time. I followed him a few steps behind. When he got to the first corner of the bell tower, I came close to him. \"Excuse me,\" I said as politely as I could, \"but I wonder why you came up.\"\n\"You'd never guess.\" he said.\n\"Not the view or the fresh air on this winter day?\"\n\"No.\" he said.\n\"Tell me, then.\"\nHe smiled, \"Perhaps climbing up the tower. You have noticed - and yet, not being blind, perhaps you won't - how the sun shines into the tower through the windows here and there, so that one can feel the cool steps suddenly become quite warm, even in winter. But behind the wall there is shade  . There is no place so good as this for feeling the difference between light and darkness. Though I'm blind, I also want to feel the happiness brought by the sunlight. In fact, it isn't my first time to be here.\" He said and seemed as pleased as a child.\nI had never thought that even a blind man could have his way to enjoy the beautiful life. But we often paid no attention to its value because we never lost it.\nWe went down the tower together and I left him. From then on, I began to treasure what life has given me.", "id": "high10080.txt"}
