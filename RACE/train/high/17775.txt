Yet in East Africa,simple phones like these are changing the face of the economy, thanks to the mobile money services that are spreading across the region.\n    Using the text-messaging function built into the GSM system used by most cell phone networks, these services allow people without a bank account or credit card to use their phone as an electronic wallet that can be used to store. send or receive cash.\n     It works like this: you pay cash to your local agent who then tops up your mobile money account using a secure form of text messaging.
