He says he needs bottles that have already contained drinkable liquids to be sure that drinking water would not be polluted.\n\"The fact is that tests show that AFM does the job better than glass, it is easier to clean and reuse and has all sorts of properties that make it ideal for other applications, \"he claimed. He also thinks the market will be able to take 250 000 tones of green sand a year. The plan is to build five or six factories in cites in UK where the bottles come from to cut down on transport.\nThe factory will be completed this month and is expected to go into full production on January 14 next year. Once it is providing a \"regular\" product, the government's drinking water inspectorate will be asked to perform tests and approve it for general use by water companies.", "id": "high8724.txt"}
