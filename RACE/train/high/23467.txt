The number of students doing so has increased 2 percent annually in recent years, according to the Department of Education.\n         In 2009, Jessica Fuller, then 25, was employed at a small private university in Philadelphia as a clerk in an office. Bored with her job and becoming increasingly interested in healthcare industry, Fuller knew she would need a master's degree in public health for her dream career.\n         At first, Fuller wanted a school in New York and Pennsylvania, but with many programs costing over $30,000 per year for tuition alone, she decided on an option she could better afford ---- the Netherlands. A similar degree in health economics cost less than $ 17,000 for a one-year program.\n         To finance her education at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, Fuller took out a $30,000 bank loan through her mother's credit, which covered tuition and fees, as well as air travel and living expenses for her year abroad. \n         The cost may be lower, but is the quality of education overseas just as good as an American university? Jessica Fuller says in her case, yes: she found a consulting job with Marsh Inc. as an International Knowledge Manager shortly after she graduated from Erasmus University, and says that the university ---and its location---- were definitely a factor.\n         \"Many Erasmus professors were world famous experts in their fields,\" says Fuller. \"Considering the variety of the students, the class discussions were very robust. Having an \"international\" advantage made a huge difference.\"", "id": "high23467.txt"}
