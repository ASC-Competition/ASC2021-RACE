I began studying this question and answers are interesting.\nOne morning, I got into three different taxis and announced,\"Well,it's my first day back in New York in seven years.I've been in prison.\"Not a single driver replied,so I tried again.\"Yeah,I shot a man in Reno.\"I explained, hoping the driver would ask me why, but nobody asked.The only response came from a Ghanaian driver,\"Reno? That is in Nevada?\"\nTaxi drivers were uniform sympathetic when I said I'd just been fired.\"This is America,\"a Haitian driver said.\"One door is closed.Another is open.\"He argued against my plan to burn down my boss' s house.A Pakistani driver even turned down a chance to profit from my loss of hope;he refused to take me to the middle of the George Washington Bridge--a $20 trip.\"Why do you want to go there? Go home and relax.Don't worry.Take a new job.\"\nOne very hot weekday in July, while wearing a red ski mask and holding a stuffed pillowcase with the word \"BANK\" on it, I tried calling a taxi five times outside different banks.The driver picked me up every time.My ride with a Haitian driver was typical of the superb assistance I received.\n\"Let's go across the park,\" I said.\"I just robbed the bank there.I got $25,000.\"\n\"$25,000?\" he asked.\n\"Yeah,you think it was wrong to take it?\"\n\"No, man.I work 8 hours and I don't make almost $70.If I can do that,I will do it too.\"\nAs we approached 86th and Lexington, I pointed to the Chemical Bank.\n\"Hey,there is another bank,\"I said,\"Could you wait here a minute while I go inside?\"\n\"No,I can't wait.Pay me now.\" His unwillingness may have had something to do with money--taxi drivers think the rate for waiting time is too low--but I think he wanted me to learn that even a bank robber can't expect unconditional support.", "id": "high5832.txt"}
