It may be walking, cycling, swimming, or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some forms--football, basketball, hockey, golf or tennis. It may be mountaineering.\nThose who have a _ for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks in high mountains? This astonishment is caused, probably, by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\nMountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no man-made rules, as others, as there are for such games as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of different kinds which would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from man-made rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\nIf we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"team game\". We should be mistaken in this. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\nThe mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. His sport requires high mental and physical qualities.\nA mountain climber continues to improve in skills year by year. A skier is probably past his best by the age of thirty. But it is not unusual for men of fifty or sixty to climb the highest mountains in the Alps. They may take more time than younger men, but they perhaps climb with more skills and less waste of effort, and they certainly experience equal enjoyment.", "id": "high5731.txt"}
