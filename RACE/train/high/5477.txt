Water constantly runs into it, but, because of the law of gravity  ,nothing can flow out of it. Do you know the name of this famous lake? It's called the Dead Sea. It's called this because no living thing could live there. The water is almost dead, compared to what happens with \"living water\".\nWhen you think of the term \"living water\", the image that comes to mind is a rushing river that is flowing. It's filled with life and movement. It doesn't just \"receive\", but is also \"giving\" simultaneously.\nMany of us believe that we need to receive more of something in order to be happy. Whether what we desire is money or something else, we think we need more of it in order to be fulfilled.\nAs a result, we begin to operate in fear and therefore don't give anything because we're afraid that we won't have enough. The result? Like the Dead Sea, we become lifeless. Life is meant to flow. when a pool stops flowing, it becomes stagnant . Stagnant water breeds disease and death. It can't breathe. It can't receive any more. If nothing is flowing out, there's no room for anything else to come in.\nThe solution? Give. As you give, you'll receive. It's a universal law. You see it at work everywhere. we've somehow been deceived (  )into believing that if we don't give, we'll have more. Or we're afraid that if we do give, we won't have anything left. On one hand, this seems to make sense. But it doesn't work. Because when we don't give, we shut off the flow of what's coming in.", "id": "high5477.txt"}
