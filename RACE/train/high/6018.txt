It took her seven years to finish writing it. During those seven years she had a number of jobs, including one job as an English teacher in Portugal.\nRowling sent the book to four publishers before one of them bought it. She was very happy to sell her book because it was her life's dream to be a published writer. Before she sold her book, Rowling was living in a small apartment with her daughter and was so poor that she could not afford heat in the winter.\nHarry Potter became very successful with children and adults in England. The book also really took off in the United States. After her second and third books were published, the three Harry Potter books filled the top three places on many newspapers' lists of best-sellers. Then the books were made into popular movies. Without question, Rowling's life had completely changed, in just three years.\nHarry Potter books have now sold more than 30 million books around the world and have been translated into more than thirty-five languages. In 1997, Rowling was earning PS70 (about US$110) a week. By the end of 2001, she had earned over PS150 million ($250 million), making her one of the most successful female writers of all time.", "id": "high6018.txt"}
