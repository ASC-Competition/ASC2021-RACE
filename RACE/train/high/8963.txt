In this simple test, smokers, deprived smokers and nonsmokers performed equally well.\nThe next test was more complex, requiring all to scan sequences of 20 identical letters and respond the instant one of the letters transformed into a different one. Non-smokers were faster, but under the stimulation of nicotine  , active smokers were faster than deprived smokers.\nIn the third test of short-term memory, non-smokers made the fewest errors, but deprived smokers committed fewer errors than active smokers.\nThe fourth test required people to read a passage, then answer questions about it. Non-smokers remembered 19 percent more of the most important information than active smokers, and deprived smokers bested those who had smoked a cigarette just before testing. Active smokers tended not only to have poorer memories but also had trouble separating important information from insignificant details.\n\"As our tests became more complex.\" Sums up Spilich, \"non-smokers performed better than smokers by wider and wider margins\" He predicts, \"smokers might perform adequately at many jobs until they got complicated. A smoking airline pilot could fly adequately if no problems arose, but if something went wrong, smoking might damage his mental capacity.\"", "id": "high8963.txt"}
