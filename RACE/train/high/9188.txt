A recent DNA test showed that he is male. Zoo worker Celia said  To avoid mixing species, the zoo has had to keep him apart from the other macaws, which has left him lonely and bored. \"He is quite sociable, although he has only learned to say 'Hello', but when he hears music, he dances\" Celia said\nHe has a yellow circle around his eyes that set off the rest of his blue feathers. He is more or less a cousin to Blu , he macaw that starts in the movie, Rio.That species, cyanopsitta-spixii ,is all blue and even more endangered than the hyacinth macaw.\nLike the bird in the movie, scientists hope to find Coco a mate to- rebuild the species. Because international laws against animal training are now so strict, nobody is willing to lend the zoo a female. \"The best solution is to find a female hyacinth macaw in our country. \" Celia said, \"there are at least two other known hyacinth-macaws but without DNA test, it is impossible to know if they are female, and the owners are not willing to help,because the mating process can take some time and be a little hard on females.\"", "id": "high9188.txt"}
