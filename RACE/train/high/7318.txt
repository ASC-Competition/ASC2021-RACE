Bush on them last week. But this was no carnival   - it was the Republican Party's National Convention  , which attracted thousands of protestors  . It was the largest protest ever at a US political convention, with at least 120,000 people marching through Manhattan on August 29. They demanded that the US leave Iraq and a new president be chosen.\nThe Republicans say the opposition - Democrat Party   encouraged the people on to the streets. They believe it is a democratic move to help win presidential election, to be held on November 2. The election is described as \"the decisive battle between donkey and elephant\". The two animals are the symbols of the two major political parties in the US. The elephant represents   the Republicans, whose candidate  , President George W. Bush, is trying to defeat the donkey to win his second them. The donkey represents the democrats, whose candidate, John Kerry, is trying to kick the elephant out of the White House.\nRepublicans think the elephant is powerful and clever, but the Democrats argue it is stupid and conservative  . In return, the Republicans regard the donkey as stubborn   and silly but the Democrats say it is humble, plain, smart and courageous.\nThe Republicans have been sending emails to Bush supporters and journalists with the heading, \"An Elephant Never Forgets\", said party spokeswoman Heather Layman. Elephants are known for their long memories. The emails suggest that Bush will keep his promises, while Kerry will not stick to his words.\nIt is interesting that both symbols were created by a single person, Thomas Nast, a famous political cartoonist of the late 19th century. During the election in 1874, Nast drew a cartoon, in which a donkey in a lion's skin frightened an elephant marked \"Republican\".", "id": "high7318.txt"}
