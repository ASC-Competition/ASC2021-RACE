But the research has proved that _ is not generally the case in natural vegetation.\nIn the Queen's project, PhD student Laura Keating targeted the largest \"host plants\" of 16 woody plant species growing in the Okanogan Valley, British Columbia. The research team calculated the number and variety of plants that neighbored each large host plant. They then randomly selected plots without host plants and calculated the plant species there as well. The research showed that the massive trees have no effect on the number of species with which they coexist.\nSmaller plants have many advantages over their overbearing neighbors, Professor Aarssen notes. Larger species generate physical space niches under their shelters where smaller species grow well. Smaller plants are much more effective than large trees at using available resources. They also produce seeds at a much younger age and higher rate than their bigger counterparts, and settle down much more quickly--thuscompeting with the newly-born plants of larger species.", "id": "high6636.txt"}
