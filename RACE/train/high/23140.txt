All over' the world spring is the season of.new life: flowers bloom, baby animals are born, and the weather becomes warmer.During this time of year, people usually walk around with a spring in their steps and a feeling of fresh beginnings.However, for a fresh beginning it takes more than the bright color1s and fresh air of spring.We need to look at ourselves, set new goals, and decide how to improve ourselves.\n    In England people usually do this on the first day of the year. We look at the past year and think about what we' d like to change or improve in our lives, and we call this a New Year' s resolution.These can be anything from improving one' s health through exercise or cutting out bad habits, to studying harder for better grades or trying to find a good work/life balance.\n    Luckily, we don' t have to wait for the beginning of a new year to try and become better people.We can do this whenever we like.The milestone of a new term is just a good place to start.\n    Sometimes it' s difficult to take the first step in achieving newly set goals, but an old saying is \"to begin is to be half-way there.\" I agree with this because taking on a new task or changing habits can seem  _ at first, but once we begin, they get easier.For example, spending less time on QQ or playing video games and more time studying or communicating face-to-face can be difficult habits to change at first.But once we settle into the new routine and start to see the results,  it' s difficult not to wonder why we didn't do it sooner.\n   The trick with deciding on a resolution for a new term is not to set unrealistic targets. If we do this, it's easy to lose motivation because the end goal seems so far away. Try to make many small targets you want to reach on the way to your ultimate goal.This way, you can see your progress easily.", "id": "high23140.txt"}
