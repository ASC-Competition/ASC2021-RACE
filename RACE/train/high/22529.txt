In the room where Miss Saeki used to spend time with her boyfriend. As I said, there is some change to the library, but it's the very same room. \"\n       Silence on my part.\n    \"Miss Saeki's life stopped at age 20,when her lover died. No, maybe not age 20, maybe much earlier... I don't know the details, but you need to know of this. The hands of the clock inside her soul stopped then. Time outside, of course, flows on as always, but she isn't affected by it. For her, what we consider normal time is meaningless.\"\n       \"Meaningless?\"\n    Oshima nods. \"Like it doesn't exist. \"\n    \"What you're saying is Miss Saeki still lives in that frozen time?\"\n    \"Exactly. When you get to know her better you'll understand.\"\n    Oshima reaches out and lays a hand on my knee on a totally natural gesture. \"Kafka,in everybody's life there's a point of no return. And in a very few cases, a point where you can't go forward any more. And when you reach that point, all we can do is quietly accept the fact. That's how we survive.\"\n    We're about to get onto the main highway. \"There's one other thing I'd like you to know of,\" he goes on. \"Miss Saeki has a wounded heart. To some degree that's true of all of us. But Miss Saeki has a special wound that goes beyond the usual meaning of the term. Her soul moves in mysterious ways. I'm not saying she's dangerous-don't get me wrong. On a day-to-day level she's certainly got her act together, probably more than anyone else I know. She's attractive, deep, smart. But just don't let it worry you if you notice something strange about her sometimes.\"\n       \"Strange?\" I can't help asking.\n       Oshima shakes his head. \"I really like Miss Saeki, and respect her. I'm sure you'll come to feel the same way.\"\n       This doesn't really answer my question, but Oshima doesn't say anything.", "id": "high22529.txt"}
