The researchers found that those who drank green tea at least three times a week were  14 percent less likely to develop a cancer of the digestive ( ) system. More than 19,000 were considered regular green-tea drinkers, who drank it more than three times a week. Over 11 years, 1,255 women developed a digestive system cancer, In general, the risks were somewhat lower when a woman drank green tea often and for a long time. Green tea contains certain chemicals which may reduce the body-cell damage that can lead to cancer and other diseases.\n         Women who  _ a lot of green tea in the study were also younger, ate more fruits and vegetables, exercised more and had higher-income jobs. None of the women smoked or drank alcohol regularly, and the researchers also collected information on their diets, exercise habits, weight and medical history. Yet even with all these things factored in, women's tea habits remained linked to their cancer risks, they noted, even though this type of study cannot prove cause and effect.\n         The study adds to debate over the effect of green tea on cancer risks, Past studies have so far come to conflicting findings on whether green tea drinkers really do have lower cancer risks.Nobody can say whether green tea itself is the reason, since green tea lovers are often more health-conscious in general.", "id": "high22446.txt"}
