About 1/3 of the world's population has English as its mother tongue. 75% of the world's mail is in English.\nEnglish is the official language or is widely used in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, India, United Arab Ernirates, Canada, the United States, Panama, Surinam, South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya.
