Even if they're just microbes , it will be pretty exciting.\"\nObama also said he was impressed by the attention that's been paid to flight director Bobak Ferdowsi, the \"Mohawk Guy\" whose star-spangled haircut and warmhearted behavior during Curiosity's Aug. 5 landing won him Internet fame.\n\"I, in the past, thought about getting a Mohawk myself,\" Obama joked. \"But my team keeps on discouraging me. And now that he's received marriage proposals and thousands of new Twitter followers, I think I'm going to go back to my team and see if it makes sense.\"\nThe congratulatory phone call is a tradition for the White House. But it was clear that Obama particularly enjoyed congratulating the scientists and engineers behind the amazingly successful landing of NASA's newest Mars exploration.\nHe also said the achievement reflected the American spirit, and he gave his personal promise to protect these critical investments in science and technology.\n\"This is the kind of thing that inspires kids across the country,\" he said. \"They're telling their moms and dads they want to be part of a Mars mission, maybe even the first person to walk on Mars. And that kind of inspiration is the byproduct of work of the sort that you guys have done.\"\nThe Curiosity rover's $2.5 billion mission focuses on studying billions of years' worth of geology on Mars and determining whether the planet was ever potentially suitable for people to live in. The mission is not specifically designed to explore life, even on the range of microbes, but it could point the way for future life-exploration experiments.", "id": "high6428.txt"}
