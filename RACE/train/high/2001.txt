Failure can also create fame, just like William Hung, 21, a native of Hong Kong.\nHung recently has made an agreement with US-based entertainment firms Koch Records and Fuse Music Network. They will publish a full-length record, titled \"The True Idol\" on April 6.\nThe idol is a civil engineering student at the University of California at Berkeley. He did a version of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\" on the television show \"American Idol 3\", on January 27. The Fox TV singing contest searches for pop stars among ordinary people. In the case of Hung, however, his act was so bad that the judges cut him off in mid-act.\nHung's response? \"I already gave my best, so I have no regrets at all.\" That's good, because any common person would have found plenty to regret: The off-key singing. The blue Hawaiian shirt worn with pants pulled up too high. The terrible dancing. The hips jerking   to a beat that did not belong to the song, maybe not even to this planet. It was, by all accounts, bad.\nBut, it was this very bad act that sold well.\nMarc Juries, president of Fuse, explained it this way: \"Every one of us is happily guilty of singing our favorite song at the top of our lungs with complete freedom, completely off-key and completely unworried. That's what William did and immediately won the hearts of America.\"\nWhatever _ is, for the moment it's big. Three websites devoted to Hung have gone up on the Internet in the past few weeks. Versions of his performance have been remixed with hip hop and techno-music and have made it to the top 10 request list at a Chicago radio station.\nSo, what does Hung think of this?\n\"There were all these people saying things about me. A lot were saying I was very courageous and that I was great on the show, but some didn't have much respect for me and some were kind of mean.\"\nNow he says he's not so sure whether to distance himself from the glamour   or to accept it. Returning to normal hasn't been easy.", "id": "high2001.txt"}
