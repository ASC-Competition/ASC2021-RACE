Along the way he had completely run out of money and was forced to spend the night in his car. This continued until one morning, after a week of sleeping in his car, he walked nervously into a restaurant and ordered a big breakfast.\nAfter eating his first good meal in weeks, he lied to the waiter, telling him he had lost his wallet. This waiter, who was also the owner of the restaurant, walked behind the chair where the young man had been sitting. He bent down, and came up with a $20 bill that looked as if it had fallen on the floor and said, \"You must have dropped this,\" the owner said. The young man couldn't believe his luck. He quickly paid for the breakfast, left a tip, bought gas with the money, and went to the West.\nOn the way out of town, he began to understand what that man did. Maybe nobody dropped the money. \"Maybe that man knew I was in trouble and he helped me in a way that didn't hurt me. So I just made a promise to help other people if I can.\"\nLater, he worked very hard and became a rich man. Now, he lives in Kansas City. Each year he gives away thousands of dollars. He is known as the \"Secret Santa \" because at Christmas time each year, he personally hands money out to those on the street and at restaurants.", "id": "high18986.txt"}
