How about a scarlet frog? Scientists haven't spotted either species in more than 20 years. What happened to them? Are the creatures still out there, or are they extinct?\nThose are questions that scientists hope to answer. They recently set out around the world in search of those and other long-missing amphibians. An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frog, toads , and salamanders are amphibians.\nThe experts are looking for about 100 species. They are searching at least 14 countries on five continents. They will look for the salamander in North America. They hope to find the scarlet frog in South America. They're also looking for species in Africa, Asia and Australia.\nScientists are hopeful that they'll find the amphibians--and soon! If the creatures are out there, they may need help. Many amphibians are endangered. The animals face many dangers including pollution and diseases. People cut down the forests where they live.\n\"If researchers can find the missing creatures, they might be able to figure out how to save them,\" explains expert Robin Moore. He began searching for the amphibians earlier this month.\n\"This search will tell us a lot about how amphibians are doing,\" Moore told WR News. \"I don't know what we will find, but that makes the search even more exciting.\"\nLost in the Wild\nScientists' hunt for missing amphibians is under way. Read about some of the species they hope to find.\nTurkestanian salamander\nThis salamander is a mystery to scientists. Experts found a few of them more than 100 years ago, but none have been seen ever since.\nGastric brooding frog\nExperts first discovered this frog in 1914 in eastern Australia. It may be extinct because of disease and habitat loss.\nRio Pescado stubfoot toad\nLast sighting: 1995, in South America\nScientists hope to find this spotted toad in rivers and rainforests in Ecuador. The animal faces threats including pollution and disease.", "id": "high6631.txt"}
