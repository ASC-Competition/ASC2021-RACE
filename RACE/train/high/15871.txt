It's a weekly tradition that my two little girls and I began years ago. Thursday has become our day to go out and make a positive contribution. On this particular Thursday, we had no idea exactly what we were going to do. At noon, I drove to a McDonald's with my daughters because they kept complaining that they hadn't had enough to eat at breakfast. There we saw some homeless people in the street and we bought lunch for them.\nWe were about to complete when we found a small woman standing at the corner, asking for change. We handed her some food, and then started to head home. Suddenly from the mirror of the car, I saw the woman waving at us, so I had to turn around and stopped where the small woman stood. She walked to our car, and said, \"Thank you, lady! No one has ever done anything like this for me before.\" I replied, \"Well, I'm glad that we were the first.\" Feeling uneasy, and wanting to move the conversation along, I asked, \"So, when do you think you'll eat your lunch?\"\nShe just looked at me with her huge, tired brown eyes and said, \"Oh honey, I'm not going to eat this lunch.\" I was confused, but before I could say anything, she continued. \"You see, I have a little girl of my own at home and she just loves McDonald's, but I can never buy it for her because I just don't have the money. But you know what...tonight she is going to have McDonald's!\"\nI don't know if the kids noticed the tears in my eyes. So many times I had questioned whether our Acts of Kindness were too small to have effect on those poor people. Yet at that moment, I realized the truth of Mother Teresa's words: \"We cannot do great things -- only small things with great love.\"", "id": "high15871.txt"}
