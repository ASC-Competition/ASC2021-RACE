Instead she cycles everywhere. \"It's cheap, keeps me fit, and is of course better for the environment.\"\n   _ In Britain, the percentage of 17- to 20-year-olds with driving licences fell from 48% in the early 1990s to 35% last year. The number of miles travelled by all forms of domestic transport has remained unchanged for years. Meanwhile, road traffic figures for cars and taxis, having risen more or less every year since 1949, have continued to fall since 2007. Motoring groups put it down to oil prices and the economy. Others offer a more fundamental explanation: the golden age of motoring is over.\n\"The way we run cars is changing fast,\" says Tim Pollard, associate editor at CAR magazine, \"Car manufacturers are worried that younger people in particular don't like to own cars like we used to in the 70s, 80s, or even the 90s, they were owning things for shorter periods. As hi-tech research and development budgets try to keep pace with the iPhone generation, Pollard says carmakers are also coming to terms with less possessive buyers. \nThis has led to a different ownership and rental  schemes such as Streetcar, Zipcar and Whipcar. In response, the latest deals from the big carmakers are very unlike your usual deals. \"Peugeot , for instance, has launched a European project called Mu,\" says Pollard. \"You become a member and can then rent whichever Peugeot best suits your mobility needs that day. So you can borrow a truck to move house at the weekend.' Other car manufacturers are studying similar ideas.", "id": "high22326.txt"}
