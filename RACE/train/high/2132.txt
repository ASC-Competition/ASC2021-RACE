But back then he was the object of jokes in school gym classes in England's rural Devonshire.\nIt was a mountain bike he received for his 15th birthday that changed him. At first the teen went biking alone in a nearby forest. Then he began to cycle along with a runner friend. Gradually, Saunders set his mind building up his body, increasing his speed, strength and endurance. At age 18, he ran his first marathon.\nThe following year, he met John Ridgway, who became famous in the 1960s for rowing an open boat across the Atlantic Ocean. Saunders was hired as an instructor at Ridgway's school of Adventure in Scotland, where he learned about the older man's cold-water exploits  . _ , Saunders read all he could about Arctic explorers and North Pole expeditions, then decided that this would be his future.\nJourneys to the Pole aren't the usual holidays for British country boys, and many people dismissed his dream as fantasy. \"John Ridgway was one of the few who didn't say, 'You are completely crazy,'\" Saunders says.\nIn 2001, after becoming a skilled skier, Saunders started his first long-distance expedition toward the North Pole. He suffered frostbite, had a closer encounter   with a polar bear and pushed his body to the limit.\nSaunders has since become the youngest person to ski alone to the North Pole, and he's skied more of the Arctic by himself than any other Briton. His old playmates would not believe the transformation.\nThis October, Saunders, 27, heads south to explore from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back, an 1800-mile journey that has never been completed on skis.", "id": "high2132.txt"}
