I plan to call it Work Out. It will cater to married women in need of a little fun. On Friday nights, they will be able to come here and enjoy themselves.\nSee, I have a gift for business. I am, as my wife Zsa Zsa likes to note, \"A man with a million ideas, none of them very good.\" Speaking of Zsa Zsa, she is fed up with this plain little life I've made for us----too many kids, too many chores, mind - numbing debt. The other day, she said she thought we needed a new family car. _ I said, and saw my dear Zsa Zsa age about 20 years, and become her mother right before my eyes.\nYes, money is our madness. Last year, we thought we had found a little _ when I published a book about the life here in suburban America. It sold 12 copies----six of them to my mother.

I am a writer, but also the breadwinner in my family. I'm at the keyboard at 6 almost every morning, hoping to tap out one idea----just one----that will take us up the hill, to the mountain, to the top.", "id": "high2823.txt"}
