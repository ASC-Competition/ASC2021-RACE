You will see that not a day passes in which he does not find something or other to make him happy, though he may be in tears the next moment. Then look at a man; any one of us will do. You will notice that weeks and months can pass. Days are greeted with nothing more than resignation  . A man can not smile like a child, for a child smiles with his eyes, whereas a man smiles with his lips alone. It is not a smile; but a grin  ; something to do with humor, but little to do with happiness. \nSir Henry Stewart was a lawyer. He was certainly successful. It is twenty years ago since he came down to our village from London.\nI remembered some ten years ago when he was made a King's Counsel  , Amos and I, seeing him get off the London train, went to congratulate him. We grinned with pleasure; he merely looked as miserable as though he'd received a penal   sentence. It was the same when he was knighted. He never smiled a bit. He took his success as a child does his medicine. \nI asked him one day what it was like to achieve all one's ambitions. He looked down at his roses and went on watering them. Then he said \"The only value in achieving one's ambition is that you then realize that they are not worth achieving.\"\nI recall this incident, for yesterday, I was passing his house, and had drawn up my cart just outside his garden wall. I had pulled in from the road for no other reason than to let a bus pass me. As I sat there filling my pipe, I suddenly heard a shout of joy come from the other side of the wall.\nI peered over. There stood Sir Henry doing nothing less than a tribal war dance of unashamed ecstasy  . When he saw me staring over the wall, he shouted, \"Come and see. Look! I have done it at last! I have done it at last!\"\nThere he was, holding a small box of earth in his hand. I observed three tiny shoots out of it.\n\"And there were only three!\" he said, his eyes laughing to heaven.\n\"Three what?\" I asked.\n\"Peach stones\", he replied. \"I've always wanted to make peach stones grow, even since I was a child, when I used to take them home after a party, or as a man after a banquet. And I used to plant them, and then forgot where I planted them. But now at last I have done it, and, what's more, I had only three stones, and there you are, one, two, three shoots,\" he counted. And Sir Henry ran off, calling for his wife to come and see his achievement.", "id": "high17591.txt"}
