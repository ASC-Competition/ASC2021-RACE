Your interest in the job?\nSpeak clearly and loudly enough. Show interest and enthusiasm in your voice. When you speak, look at the interviewer. Also, don't say negative things about yourself, or former employer.\nListen to questions carefully.

They don't expect you to be totally calm and relaxed. But they expect you to try to control your nervousness. They expect you to show confidence in your ability to do the job.\nAt the end of the interview, thank the interviewer for her or his time.\nIt's a good idea to send a short thank-you letter right after the interview, or deliver it by hand.\nPhone the company if you have not heard anything after one week. Ask if they have made a decision about the job.\nGood luck!", "id": "high8293.txt"}
