(The automatic gratuity, however, had already been added to the total.)\nThe Reddit user who submitted the image explained in the comments section that the receipt was part of a total bill for a party of 20, which is why the gratuity was automatically added.\n\"Parties up to eight ... may tip whatever they'd like, but larger parties receive an automatic gratuity,\" the server wrote. \"It's in the computer; it's not something I do.\"\nThe server added: \"They had no problem with my service, and told me I was great. They just didn't want to pay when the time came.\" \nScribbling  notes on receipts has become something of a trend. Earlier this month, the manager of a North Carolina Red Robin surprised an overdue pregnant woman by comping her meal.\n\"Once seated, a manager came up to us and started talking,\" the woman's husband told Consumerist. \"He was extremely friendly and jokingly asked my wife if this was her last meal before heading to the hospital.\"\nWhen the check came, a note from the manager next to her portion of the bill read: \"MOM 2 BEE GOOD LUC.\"\n\"It was a pleasant surprise and made my tired-of-being-pregnant wife a little more cheery,\" the man said.", "id": "high24196.txt"}
