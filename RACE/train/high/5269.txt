Many people believe that they deserve success simply because they believe that they deserve success.\nBut there is a widespread belief that people who get on in life may be successful not because they deserve it, but because of influential    friends or the right background. Sometimes it may just be a comforting and harmless belief, while at the other extreme it can be very destructive. I once met a brilliant young engineer who worked in a chemical plant. Because of her knowledge and experience, she should have been promoted to Production Manager. Instead, the job went to a man who was totally unsuited for the post. Everyone knew that he only got it because he was politically acceptable to his superiors  . This injustice discouraged the young engineer and many of her colleagues. It also meant that the factory was much less efficient than it could have been.\nAt the same time, we should not be pessimistic  . More and more the modern world depends on having people who are in the job because they are good enough, not just because their faces fit. There is a story of a factory owner who sent for an engineer to see to a machine which would not go. He examined it, then took out a hammer and tapped, once. The machine started up immediately. When he presented his bill, the owner protested, \"This can't be right! $ 100 just for tapping a machine with a hammer?\" The engineer wrote out a new bill: \"For tapping a machine, $1; for knowing where to tap. $99.\"", "id": "high5269.txt"}
