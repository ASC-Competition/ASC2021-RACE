Being very short of money, I applied.\nThree days later, a letter arrived, asking me to go to Croydon for an interview. It proved a tiring journey: a train to Croydon station; a ten-minute bus ride and then a walk of at least fifteen minutes.\nIt was clearly the headmaster himself that opened the door. He was short and fat, with a grey-color1ed moustache,a deeply lined face and hardly any hair. \nHe looked at me with surprised disapproval.

She's the one who really runs this school.\"\nThis was the last thing I could hear. I was young. How could my dignity allow me to work under an old woman?", "id": "high18854.txt"}
