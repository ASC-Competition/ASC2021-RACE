What will you do? Many new graduates feel lost when they consider the endless list of career choices. They've invested   a lot of money for their diploma   and now an important question stares them in the fact.\n       I've seen so many new graduates who do not know how to use the degree they have just earned. An example was Dave, who loved sports and had played baseball throughout his college years. He had his heart set on working for Nike. But he had never made clear in his own mind what kind of job he could do for Nike, so nothing ever happened. Another example was Allison, who was a history major. She wanted to work as an event planner but, unfortunately, no one hired her. Why? No experience.\n       Failing to do some solid career exploration first or to get a clear idea of the types of jobs you can do is a big error that many college students make. After our suggestion, Dave and Allison both found their jobs. To ensure a brighter future, follow these effective strategies:\n       -- Make educated career choices. Identify the job you want. Conduct research. Ask parents to advise you on actual job duties. Consider what your matured talents are, and look for positions where you can use them.\n       -- Don't rely on the Internet. Networking is an effective tool -- be sure it's a job-hunting strategy you use. New studies from the Department of Labor state that only 4% of job-seekers found their job on the Internet. The fact is that 63% of all jobs are filled by contacts.\n       -- Employers are making quick decisions. Most people lose the job in the first minute of the interview. It's deadly to let the employers focus quickly on how well you can perform the job.\n       -- Practice your interviewing skills. Be ready for the tough questions by first writing out good answers to possible questions and having a role-playing interview with your friend.", "id": "high22449.txt"}
