In the classic TV production, one scene in particular impressed me: when Mrs Darling puts her children into bed. As she turns off the last of the night lights, she takes one last look at the bedroom and says, \"Dear night lights, protect my sleeping children.\" As a mother, I know how much she loves her children.\nIt has been several weeks since we took our daughter to college and she seems to be adjusting   well after a short period of homesickness. For us, though, it's another story. Like most parents, I love checking in on my children at night. But now she's gone, and I find nighttimes the hardest.

And it's not just \"first-time\" parents like me. Two moms who have kids already well into college said the separation didn't get any easier. \"You feel like something has been taken away from inside you,\" said one of them.\nI imagine things will get easier with time, especially as I see my daughter adjust to college life. Meanwhile, as I keep my cellphone close to me in bed and text my daughter goodnight and sweet dreams every night, I like to think that messages serve as a night light that keeps her safe.", "id": "high344.txt"}
