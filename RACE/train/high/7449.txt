Overall, I am happy with the location. At the beginning I had planned to live here for at least two years. I like here.\nHowever, I am very disappointed in that there seems to be a terrible roach   problem. I can't invite any guest over because of this problem and I cannot recommend   Canyon Crossing to any of my classmates either.\nI have left two voice mails for you which are concerned with this problem. You have not returned either one. Therefore, this letter is my next step in hoping to solve the problem. I am kindly asking you to ask an exterminator   by July 15th. If you fail to do so, I will have no choice but to make a complaint to the BBB (Better Business Bureau).\nYou are welcome to text me anytime at (435) 234-3452. I hope this problem will be solved soon.\nThank you.\nYours sincerely,                                                            Unhappy Ursula\nDear Sir,\nI am a new resident   at Sunning Court. I have seen the condition of the building becoming worse and worse since I moved here last year.\nFirst of all, the management of the building is really terrible. Sometimes, there is a bad smell when I walk on the road. I see much rubbish there. No cleaners clean the rubbish. Many roaches and rats run around the building.\nMy second problem is about the security  . I always see the guards reading newspapers or smoking when they are on duty. The security room is very dusty too. When I want to use the phone, they say, \"We can't help.\"\nI am therefore writing to demand your company's action to improve the situation. Thank you for your consideration.\nYours faithfully,\nChris Wong", "id": "high7449.txt"}
