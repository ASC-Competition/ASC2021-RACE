She saved more than 900 dollars and was planning to buy a ticket, but she lost her purse with all her money and credit cards .\nEmma looked through the garbage  and all the buildings where she worked but came up empty-handed. She went home heartbroken. She believed that she had lost her money forever. While Emma was at home, sad and depressed, a homeless man was searching through the garbage looking for things to sell. As he was looking through a garbage bag, he found something wrapped in a plastic bag.\nThe homeless man, who did not want to be recognized, took the purse to Sherry Wesley, because Sherry Wesley knew him from her volunteer work at a homeless shelter. The homeless man came to Sherry Wesley with the wad of money and said, \"This probably belongs to someone that you work with; can you find the owner?\" Sherry Wesley works in one of the buildings that Emma cleans and she knew Emma had lost her purse.\nEmma was amazed when she heard the good news. \"I couldn't believe it when they called me,\" she said. \"He has a very big heart. If someone else had found the purse, the money would be gone.\" As a reward, Emma gave the man 100 dollars. The homeless man gave half of the money to Sherry Wesley and asked her to donate it to charity  for him.", "id": "high19163.txt"}
