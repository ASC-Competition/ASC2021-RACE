The word \"waiters\" has a male, not a female, connotation. The advertisement does not contain an equal opportunities statement and does not specify that the jobs are open to men and women.\nExample2\n    A medical clinic places an advertisement for a nurse with a photograph of a female nurse. Nursing is an occupation that is traditionally associated with women. The advertisement does not contain an equal opportunities statement. \nGood practice checklist:\n*              Advertise widely so that as many suitably qualified people as possible have an opportunity to apply.\n* Do not publish job advertisements in locations or publications where they are likely to be read wholly or mainly by people who share a particular community background, sex, race, disability, or age.\n*              Use language which is clear and simple and do not use abstract words. For example, when describing the working environment or the characteristics of desirable employees, do not use words like young, mature or energetic.\n*              Where possible, do not use job titles which have a male or female connotation. For example, do not use the following words---\n    waiter/waitress  salesman/ salesgirl     postman     manageress    foreman\nstoreman      matron       chairman/ chairwoman     head master/ mistress\n    Instead, where possible, use job titles that have gender-neutral connotation, For example, the following words are appropriate---\n  waiting staff      sales assistant    postal worker    manager    stores person      supervisor          chairperson        nurse manager     head teacher", "id": "high16688.txt"}
