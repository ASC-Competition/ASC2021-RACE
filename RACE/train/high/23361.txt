What began in 1971 as theprefix = st1 /MagicKingdomnow includes the high-tech, movie-mad Disney and Animal Kingdom. Each time the park expands, so do your chances to spend money. How can you save? As a family guide to Disney World, I've been to the park more than 25 times with my kids, and I've developed a few money-saving plans.\n    * Buy the five-day All-in-One Hopper Pass  . Even if you're visiting for fewer days, it's a deal (the pass costs $ 229 for visitors ages 10 and up, $ 183 for kids ages three to nine and is free for kids under age three). Without the pass, you'll have to pay separately for PleasureIslandand the water parks. A single trip toBlizzardBeach, for example, would cost a family of four $ 100.\n* Dine out at lunch. The prices at some of the nicer restaurants, especially those in Epcot's World Showcase, are much lower at noontime than at dinner. It's wise to make reservations before you leave home. Call 407-W-DISNEY.\n* Become a Gold Card Member. For $65, you can get a Magic Kingdom Club Gold Card (call 1-800-56-DISNEY). Card-holders get up to 20 percent off Disney hotel rooms, plus price breaks on character breakfasts, theme park tickets and goods from Disney stores.\n* Don't pay extra to see a character. Character-theme dinner shows are expensive, costing a family of four about $ 140, and even a character breakfast, where Mickey or Donald Duck joins you for cakes, can  _ $ 50. If your budget is tight, try to meet the characters inside the theme parks and at free in-park shows. You can watch the Diamond Horseshoe show, for example, in theMagicKingdomfor no additional cost, while the similarly themed Hoop-Dee-Doo Musical Revue requires expensive tickets.\n* Wait until the end of your trip to buy souvenirs. By then, the kids will really know what they want, and you won't waste money on expensive things.", "id": "high23361.txt"}
