They are very easy to catch but must not be eaten because their flesh and internal organs contain a poison. Anyone who does eat the flesh can become sick very quickly. They may even stop breathing.\nThe Blue Bottle\nThe Blue Bottle is found in most Australian waters. Blue Bottles float lightly on the surface of the water but their tentacles   can be as long as 10 metres. Blue Bottles are much less dangerous than some other jellyfish but they can give a swimmer a bad sting   if the swimmer accidentally touches them.\nStingrays\n     There are many different kinds of stingrays in Australian waters. They usually swim and feed on the bottom of the sea. Accidents can happen if people stand on them or try to pick them up. Stingrays have a sting on their tail. These stings have poison on them.
