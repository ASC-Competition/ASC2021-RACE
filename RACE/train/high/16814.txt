He was found wandering around the streets of Washington D.C. He could not hear or speak. Sometimes people pitied him and gave him food and clothing. If not, he ate what he could find in garbage cans.\n    It is said that a man named Craig found the little boy and took him to Dr. E. M. Gallaudet at Gallaudet College. Dr Gallaudet gave him the first name of Douglas, and the last name of Craig, after the man who found him.\n    Dr Gallaudet placed Douglas in the Kendall School, and he stayed there until he was old enough to work. He spent his life working in and around the halls of Gallaudet.\n    Once he courted   a black woman from Baltimore. Since his courtship required letter-writing, and he was illiterate, he had a student in the college act as his \"private secretary\". Though that relationship did not work out, he did finally marry. Later, he married a black deaf woman from Washington D.C. The wedding and reception took place in a church near the college.\n    The happy couple went to Baltimore for a honeymoon, but the honeymoon only lasted for one day. Their plans were cut short when Douglas's pocketbook containing about $300 was either lost or stolen.\n    Douglas never got very far from Washington D.C. and Gallaudet College was his world. He went to Norfolk, Virginia, once on a vacation, but he did not know what a vacation was. He spent the entire time working around the docks of Norfolk. He came home with a pocket of money, and told everyone that he had a fine vacation.\n    Douglas's last public duty was to raise the flag to the top of the new flagpole in front of College Hall. He died on February 11, 1936, but left a story at Gallaudet that would live forever.", "id": "high16814.txt"}
