The Kinema showed its first film in 1922 and the first six rows were deckchair  . Today, it's more richly decorated.\n\"People come here because it's a fantastic experience,\" says manager Philip Jones. \"Many rooms in the Kinema are simple and not attractive, but we try to remain everything that makes it special.\"\nThe Cube, Bristol\nIt's not really a cinema. It is a not-for-profit cooperative run by volunteers, which has been operating for the last 15 years.\nThey are \"unique for what we do, which is to operate seven nights a week and with no funding.\" They make many things themselves, such as cola and yogurt.\nThe Broadway, Nottingham\nA cinema has been here since the 1960s, when local fashion designer Paul Smith would come to see arty foreign films, which heavily influenced his career choice. Later, he designed the stripy  sofas.\nThe Broadway was previously used as a church, but locals love it for its independent, art house, and DIY spirit. The Broadway also has a right-on restaurant, with locally sourced vegetables and salads, and even serves its own beer.\nThe Rex, Hertfordshire\nIt opened to the public in 1938 and has been named the most beautiful cinema in the UK. There's a varied program with different films every night. Hot dogs and popcorn are banned. And a real person answers the phone when you call.\nPeople speak very highly of the Rex. So do go, if only once, to see just how a cinema should be run.", "id": "high9697.txt"}
