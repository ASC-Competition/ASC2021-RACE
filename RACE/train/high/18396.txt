First of all,mistakes are a clear sign that you are trying new things. It's always good to try new things because when you are trying new things you are growing. If you never try anything new,how can you improve?How can you expand?The simple answer is\"You can't.\"Look around you. With very few exceptions,either every-thing you see in your world or every single detail of every single thing is the result of someone trying something new.\nAnother good thing about mistakes is this:When you are making mistakes,you are learning.Consider this:Edison failed 10,000 times before he perfected the 1ight bulb.When asked how it felt to fail that many times,he said that he hadn't failed 10,000 times,but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work.\nFinally,when you make a mistake you are much closer to success.Why?Because when all is said and done,you will have tried some numbers of things before you succeed.Every time you make a mistake you eliminate one of those things and are one step closer.But this all doesn't mean that you should go ahead without considering the consequences of a mistake.Quite the contrary,when you try something new you have to be willing to set some reasonable limits so that in the event that it doesn't work out the way you want it to,you will he in a position to try again.\nWe all have limited time and money so don't blow them all on one approach to a problem.Realize that it probably won't be perfect the first time and allocate these resources properly so you can learn,make corrections,and try it again.If you accept and use your mistakes in this way,you can make great progress in your business and your career.\nThere is an old saying that goes,\"If you're not making mistakes,you're not trying hard enough.\"So go ahead and make mistakes.And learn.And grow.And succeed.", "id": "high18396.txt"}
