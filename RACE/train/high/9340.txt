In Hong Kong, education accounts for more than one-fifth of entire government spending every year.\n\"Shanghai and Hong Kong are small education systems, with a concentration of ideas, manpower and resources for education,\" says Prof Cheng.\nUnder the banner \"First class city, first class education\", Shanghai set about systematically re-equipping classroom, upgrading schools and improving the curriculum in the last decade.\nIt got rid of the \"key schools\" system which concentrated resources only on top students and top schools. Instead staff were trained in more interactive teaching methods and computers were brought in.\nAbout 80% of Shanghai school leavers go to university compared to an overall average of 24% in China.\nMeanwhile, dynamic Hong Kong was forced into educational improvements as its industries moved to cheaper mainland Chinese areas in the 1990s.Its survival as a service and management hub depends on upgrading knowledge and skills.\nIn the last decade Hong Kong has concentrated on closing the gap for all students, says a report by McKinsey management consultants.\nThe report, How the World's Most Improved School Systems Keep Getting Better, rated Hong Kong's education system among the best in the world.", "id": "high9340.txt"}
