We all use them, often without noticing what we're doing.\nI was arranging to meet someone for dinner last week, and I said \"I'll pencil it in my diary\", and my friend said \"You can ink it in\", meaning that it was a firm arrangement not a tentative one!\nMany of these new verbs are linked to new technology. An obvious example is the word fax. We all got used to sending and receiving faxes, and then soon started talking about faxing something and promising we'd fax it immediately. Then along came email, and we were soon all emailing each other madly. How did we do without it? I can hardly imagine life without my daily emails.\nEmail reminds me, of course, of my computer and its software, which has produced another\ncouple of new verbs. On my computer I can bookmark those pages from the World Wide Web that I think I'll want to look at again, thus saving all the effort of remembering their addresses and calling them up from scratch. I can do the same thing on my PC, but there I don't bookmark; I favorite--coming from \"favorite pages\", so the verb is derived from an adjective not a noun.\nNow my children bought me a mobile phone, known simply as a mobile and I had to learn yet more new verbs. I can message someone, that is, I can leave a message for them on their phone. Or I can text them, write a few words suggesting when and where to meet, for example. How long will it be before I can mobile them, that is, phone them using my mobile? I haven't heard that verb yet, but I'm sure I will soon. Perhaps I'll start using it myself!", "id": "high1609.txt"}
