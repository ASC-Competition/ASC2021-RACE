The doll really did look like a live baby from a distance. It even had a pleasant baby powder smell. I took the baby home and named him Tyler. \nMy friends and I went out for supper that night. As it was rather cold, I decided to wrap prefix = st1 /Tylerin a blanket and carry him in that way. When I walked into the restaurant, I noticed some very strange looks and quite a few raised eyebrows. My friends and I decided to make a game out of the whole situation. I stood in the Gorner pretending to rockTylerto while my friends kept looking into the blanket and said, \"Oh, how lovely. \" I could not but laugh. And although it was funny to my friends and me, some of the people did think it was so funny that  I had a baby. I overheard one couple say,\"Why would she g a baby here?\" These people were giving me rude looks and forming judgments about because they thought I was a teenage mom. Others just smiled at me pathetically  and felt sorry for me because I was only a child with a child. In our meal,my friends and I received strange looks from the others in the restaurant.

People do not realize that some things are not the way they seem. I was only  ying it around for a class project. The people in the restaurant were so quick to judge because they thought I was a teenage mom. I sometimes catch myself judging people I not know, just because of the first impression they give. In  reality, I have no idea about real stories. We should all be slower to judge others,and realize that some things are as they seem.", "id": "high17000.txt"}
