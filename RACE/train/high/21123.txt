None,\nhowever, is any better known for his humour than Lincoln. No matter the situation, it always\nreminded him of a story, and more often than not, the story was amusing.\n    It seemed that his passion for humor appeared early in life and his humor never seemed to\nfade, even under the most difficult situations. Following are some favorite Lincoln stories. All\nare fun to read.\nAbe Needs His Hair Combed\n    President Lincoln had the ability to laugh at himself and he greatly enjoyed telling stories in\nwhich he was the object of the joke. He especially liked this one: when I was nominated at\nChicago, I had never before sat for a photograph. One fellow thought that many people might\nlike to see what I looked like, so he immediately bought the camera and began selling\nphotographs of me all over the country. I happened to be in Springfield when I heard a boy\nselling them on the streets. \"Here's your likeness of \"Abe\" Lincoln!\",he shouted to Lincoln.\n\"Only two shillifigs!He'll look a lot better once he gets his hair combed!\"\nNobody Ever Died in Here!\n    A man was complaining to the President that a friend of his had been driven away from\nNew Orleans because he was a Union supporter. When the man asked to see the paper by which\nhe was driven away, he was simply told that the Confederate Government would do nothing\nillegal, and so they had issued no papers. They were simply hoping to make him go on his own\nfree will. Naturally, that reminded Lincoln of a story, and he remarked that he had known of a\nhotel keeper in St. Louis who boasted that nobody ever died in his hotel. \"Of course,\"\nLincoln said with a twinkle in his eye, \"anytime a guest appeared to be in danger of dying he\nwas carried out to die outside.\"\nLet the Elephant Run\n    Assistant Secretary of War Charles A. Dana had learned that a man named Jacob Thompson,\nwho had been causing the government many problems, was about to escape to Liverpool. Dana\napproached Lincoln with the news. Lincoln asked Dana what Secretary of War Edwin Stanton\nthought about it. Dana answered, \"He thinks we should arrest him.\"\n    Lincoln replied, \"I disagree. If you have an elephant on your hands that wants to run away,\nyou'd better let him run.\"", "id": "high21123.txt"}
