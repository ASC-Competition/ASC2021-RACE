The study found that people who watches an average six hours of TV a day lived an average 4.8 years less than those who didn't watch any television .Also ,every hour of TV that participants watched after age 25 was associated with a 22-minute reduction in their life expectancy .\nIt's no mystery that sitting in front of the TV isn't exactly healthy. The more TV you watch, the less physically active you are. And the less exercise you get, the more likely you are to develop disease such as diabetes or hear problems.\n  Lennert Veerman is the lead author of the study ,which was published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine .Working at the University of Queesland, Veerman acknowledges that it may not just be the sedentary  nature of watching TV that lowers life expectancy,but also the poor diet that onscreen junk-food advertising can promote. But Veerman says that association between watching too much TV and lower life expectancy exists, even after adjusting for diet.\n  Veerman says that it might make sense for doctors to start asking their patients about how much time they spend in front of the TV, and to treat TV time as they would be other risk factors for poor health, such as lack of exercise and an unhealthy diet.\n      Veerman points out that people who are concerned can simply turn off the TV and get off the couch. \"Exercise is good,\" he says, \"but even light physical activity also improves health.\"", "id": "high21300.txt"}
