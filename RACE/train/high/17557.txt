They were brave, and hostile; they would not take orders, and shouted \"Amandla!\" at every opportunity. Their instinct was to confront rather than cooperate.\n              The authorities did not know how to handle them, and they turned the island upside down.\nDuring the Rivonia Trial, I remarked to a security policeman that if the government did not reform itself, the freedom fighters who would take our place would some-day make the authorities miss us. That day had indeed come on Robben Island.\n                 In these young men we saw the angry revolutionary spirit of the times. I had had some warning. On a visit with Winnie a few months before, she had managed to tell me through our coded conversation that there was a rising class of discontented youths who were violent and Africanist in beliefs. She said I should be aware of them.\n                 The new prisoners were shocked by what they considered the inhuman conditions of the island, and said that they could not understand how we could live in such a way. We told them that they should have seen the island in 1964. But they were almost as sceptical of us as they were of the authorities. They chose to ignore our calls for discipline and thought our advice weak and unassertive .\n                 It was obvious that they regarded us, the Rivonia Trialists, as moderates .After so many years of being branded a radical revolutionary, to be seen as a moderate was a novel and not altogether pleasant feeling. I knew that I could react in one of two ways: I could scold them for their disrespect or I could listen to what they were saying. I chose the latter.\n                 Then some of these men, came into our section. I asked them to tell us about their movement and beliefs.\n              Shortly after their arrival on the island, the commanding officer came and asked me as a favour to address the young men. He wanted me to tell them to behave themselves, to recognize the fact that they were in prison and to accept the discipline of prison life.I told him that I was not prepared to do that. Under the circumstances, they would have regarded me as a follower of the authorities.\n                 (-adapted from \"Long walk to freedom: The autobiography of Nelson Mandela\")", "id": "high17557.txt"}
