Usually, achieving  what you set out to do is not the important thing. Let me explain.\nTwo brothers decided to dig a deep hole behind their house. As they were working, a couple of older boys stopped by to watch.\n\"What are you doing?\" asked one of the visitors.\n\"We plan to dig a hole all the way through the earth!\" one of the brothers answered excitedly.\nThe older boys began to laugh, telling the younger ones that digging a hole all the way through the earth was impossible. After a long silence, one of the diggers picked up a jar full of spiders , worms and a lot of insects. He removed the lid  and showed the wonderful contents to the visitors who were laughing at them. Then he said quietly and confidently, \"Even if we don't dig all the way through the earth, look what we found along the way!\"\nTheir goal was far too difficult, but it made them dig. And that is what a goal is for--to make us move in the direction we have chosen. In other words, it sets us to digging!\nBut not every goal will be fully achieved. Not every job will end successfully. Not every hope will come to pass. Not every love will last. But when you fall short of your aim, perhaps you can say, \"Yes, but look at what I found along the way! Look at the wonderful things which have come into my life because I tried to do something!\" And I believe it is the joy in the journey, in the end, that truly matters.", "id": "high2179.txt"}
