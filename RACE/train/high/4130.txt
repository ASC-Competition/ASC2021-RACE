The second annual National Technology Scan conducted by Park found that the main reason why potential customers say they do not subscribe to the Internet is because of the low value to their daily lives rather than concerns over cost.\nForty-four percent of these families say they are not interested in anything on the Internet, versus just 22 percent who say they cannot afford a computer or the cost of Internet service, the survey showed. The answer \"I'm not sure how to use the Internet\" came from 17 percent of participants who do not subscribe. The response \"I do all my e-commerce shopping and YouTube-watching at work\" was cited by 14 percent of Internet-access refuseniks. Three percent said the Internet doesn't reach their homes.\nThe study found U.S. broadband adoption grew to 52 percent over 2006, up from 42 percent in 2005. Roughly half of new subscribers converted  from slower-speed, dial-up Internet access while the other half of families had no prior access.\n\"The industry continues to chip  away at the core of non-subscribers, but has a long way to go,\" said John Barrett, director of research at Parks Associates. \"Entertainment applications will be the key. If anything will pull in the holdouts, it's going to be applications that make the Internet more similar to pay-TV,\" he predicted.", "id": "high4130.txt"}
