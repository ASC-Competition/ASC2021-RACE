But the problem is not in the number of students, a new report says. The report is called \"Turning the Tide -- Making Caring Common.\"\nThe report argues that the process schools use to choose students causes major problems. David Hawkins is the Executive Director for Educational Content and Policy. He says that most colleges and universities require many things from students when they apply.\nSchools usually require an essay describing a student's interests or why they want to study at that school. The schools also ask for letters from teachers describing why a student is a good candidate. But, Hawkins says, schools are most concerned with a student's high school grades and standardized test results. \nThe Education Conservancy is an organization that fights to make higher education equal and available. Lloyd Thacker is the Executive Director of the Education Conservancy, saying that the college admission process has changed a lot.\n\"Over the past 30 years, college admissions have become more complex.\" He says that ranking systems for colleges and universities are a big part of the problem.\nU.S. News and World Report is a media company that creates a list of what it calls \"America's Best Colleges.\" The company bases the list on information collected from colleges and universities across the country. This information includes results of standardized tests like the SAT from all of a school's students. Higher average test results help put schools higher on the list.\nThacker claims, \"Too many students are learning to do whatever it takes in order to get ahead, even if that means sacrificing their own individuality, their health, their happiness and behavior...\"\n\"The impact on students and on parents is that college is all about where you go. The rank has nothing to do with the quality of education that goes on at the college.\"\nThe Harvard report states that the best way to change the admission process is by changing college applications.", "id": "high19436.txt"}
