His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer  a nail into the back of the fence.\nThe first day he had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control  his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually _ . He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into fence.\nFinally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that now pull out  one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone.\nThe father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said,\" You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say thing in anger, they have a scar  just like these holes. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say 'I am sorry ', the wound is still there. A verbal  wound is as bad as physical one.\"\nThe little boy then understood how powerful his words were. He looked at his father and said \" I hope you can forgive  me ,father, for the holes I put in you.\"\n\"of course I can,\" said the father.", "id": "high6691.txt"}
