The fires that occurred in Hillborough four years ago destroyed thirty homes, most of which have been rebuilt. While the home were rebuilt, the grasses, bushes, and shrubs were re-growing. The area is now so overgrown in brush that it again brings a major danger of fire.\nThe city government asked for bids  to remove the brush. The lowest bid they received was $50,000. And that was if the city provided breakfast and lunch for the work crews for the six weeks it would take to clear the overgrown area. The city government said no, offering unlimited coffee and a doughnut a day for each crew member. When that offer was rejected, the city asked for help on its website.\nA sheepherder in Montana and a goat-herder in San Bernardino read about the city's problem while surfing the web on their laptops. They both offered to do the job for $25,000. The government chose the goat-herder because he lived closer. When told that the city dump was overflowing, the goat-herder said, \"No problem. My goats will eat everything in your dump. Except for the automobile engines, of course.\" So, for another $5,000, the city killed two birds with one stone. If all goes well, they will invite the goat-herder and his \"family\" back every three years. The goat-herder said he will probably visit San Diego while his goats are in the dump. \"I want to go there by plane; I just hope we don't crash. My goats would miss me a lot,\" he said.", "id": "high19476.txt"}
