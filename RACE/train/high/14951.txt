Besides wearing a mask, what else can we do to protect ourselves from the dirty air?\nScientists have developed a new inhaler   that can reduce the effect air pollution has on people. It could help millions of people who are suffering from air pollution,the Guardianreports.\nThis inhaler is developed by German company Bitop and contains a molecule   named Ectoine. The molecule creates a layer   that protects lungs from polluted air. It's reported that the inhaler will be affordable to most people when it comes to the market.\nAir pollution kills more than three million people a year worldwide and leads to health problems like lung and heart disease and strokes, according to a 2016 research project in the journalNature. It is also linked to brain disease, mental illness and diabetes  .\nAndreas Bilstein at Bitop believed that the inhaler could be useful around the world, because air pollution is not just a European problem: \"Especially in Asia - China in particular - the demand for such a product is even higher.\"\nMany Chinese cities have been suffering from haze. According to World Health Organization, two of the 10 most polluted cities in the world in 2015 were in China. About 800,000 deaths that are linked to air pollution take place in the country every year.\nHowever, such inhalers should never be an excuse for not trying to stop air pollution, said Professor Jean Krutmann at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine. \"The best thing is that we have clean air and we don't need any prophylactic   treatment,\" he said.", "id": "high14951.txt"}
