It shows that louder noises reduced the reported sweetness or saltiness of food while increasing the measure of crunchiness .\nIt may go some way to explain why airline food is widely complained about by both the workers and passengers. Andy Woods, a researcher, said, \"It's a general opinion that plane foods aren't fantastic, but I'm sure airlines do their best, so we wondered if there were other reasons. One thought was that perhaps the background noise may have an effect. NASA gives their space explorers very strong-tasting foods, because for some reason, they can't taste food that strongly--again, it may have something to do with the background noise.\"\nIn a study, 48 people were fed sweet foods or salty ones, while listening to nothing or noise through earphones. Meanwhile they rated  the foods. In noisier settings, foods were rated less salty or sweet than they were when it was silent, but were rated crunchier. \"The evidence shows that if the background noise is loud, your attention might be drawn to that, away from the food.\" Dr. Woods said.\n\"We are still at an early stage of progressing and this is a rather small study to really draw definitive  conclusions from,\" Dr Woods said, \"but they suggest that restaurants could well adapt their choice of food for a given environment.\"\nAlso in the group's findings there is the suggestion that the overall satisfaction with the food is also related to the degree to which people like what they are hearing.", "id": "high14952.txt"}
