Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn, was moving languidly   about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had scarcely tasted.\nShe smiled and said, \"You, Fred, you wash dishes?\"   \n\"Yes, indeed, mother,\" answered Fred. \"I should be a poor scholar if I couldn't, when I've seen you do it so many times. Just try me.\"\nA look of relief came over his mother's face as she seated herself in her low rocking chair. Fred washed the dishes and put them in the closet. He swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school.\nFred's father was away from home and as there was some cold meat in the pantry  , Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes.\nHe kept on in this way for two or three days, until his mother was able to resume her usual work. He felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who happened in one day, said, \"Well, madam, it's my opinion that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.\"\nThe doctor did not know how the \"quiet\" had been secured, nor how the boy's heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of what boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and skating being just at this time in perfection.\nBesides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He had been in the habit of going early to school and staying to play after it was dismissed.\nThe boys missed him and their curiosity was excited when he would give no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school, than that he was \"Wanted at home.\"\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Tom Barton, \"I'll find him out, boys-see if I don't!\"\nSo, one morning on his way to school, he called on Fred. As he went around to the side door, he walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was  ly needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in his hand.   \nOf course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings poor Fred received at recess  .\"Well, you're a brave one to stay at home washing dishes!\"\"Girl boy!\" \"Pretty Bessie!\"\"Lost your apron, haven't you, Polly!\"\nFred was not wanting either in spirit or in courage, and he was strongly tempted to resent these insults and to fight some of his tormentors  . But his consciousness of right and his love for his mother helped him.   \nWhile he was struggling for self-mastery, his teacher appeared at the door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it did not say, \"Don't give up! Be really brave!\" He knew the teacher had heard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates.   \nThe boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be taunted in any manner. They knew that the teacher meant what he said; and so the brave little boy had no further trouble.", "id": "high18221.txt"}
