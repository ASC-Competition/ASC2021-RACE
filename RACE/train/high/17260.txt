You can see the vessels opening up with other activities such as exercise.\" A similar effect is seen with drugs such as statins and ACE inhibitors.\nWhen blood vessels open up more, blood flows more smoothly and is less likely to form the clots that cause heart attacks and strokes. Elastic vessels also resist the hardening activity of atherosclerosis .\n\"We are not saying to stop your statins or not to exercise but rather to add this to an overall program of heart health,\" said Miller, who presented his findings to a meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans. Miller's team tested 10 healthy, non-smoking men and women, who were told to bring their favorite music. They spent half an hour listening to the recordings and half an hour listening to music they said made them feel anxious while the researchers did ultrasound tests designed to show blood vessel function. Compared to their normal baseline measurements, blood vessel diameter increased 26 percent on average when the volunteers heard their joyful music. Listening to music they disliked - in most cases in this group heavy metal - blood vessels narrowed by six percent, Miller said.\nMiller said he came up with the idea after discovering the laughter caused blood to literally flow more smoothly.\" I asked myself what other things make us feel real good, besides calories from dark chocolate of course. Music came to mind. ... It makes me feel real good,\" he said. Most of the volunteers chose country music but Miller said the style is not so important rather what pleases each individual.", "id": "high17260.txt"}
