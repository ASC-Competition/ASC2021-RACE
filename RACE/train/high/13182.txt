What difference has it made, statistically speaking?\n400 million births prevented\nThe one-child policy, officially in place since 1979, has prevented 400 million births. Parents have faced fines and other punishments for having more children.\nThe majority of the decrease in China's fertility rate happened in the 1970s. It dropped from 5.8 children per woman in 1970 to 2.7 in 1978. Despite the one-child policy the rate had only fallen to 1.7 by 2013.\n21:28-baby deaths rate\nSince the one-child policy was introduced, baby girls have become more likely to die than boys.\nIn the 1970s, according to the United Nations, 60 males per 1, 000 live births died under the age of one. For girls the figure was 53. In the 1980s, after the one-child policy became official, the rate for both was 36. By the 1990s, 26 males per 1,000 live births died before the age of one - and 33 girls. The 2000s saw 21 boys per 1,000 live births dying and 28 girls.\n1.16 boys born for every girl\nSexually selective abortions have been considered as a major cause of China's unusual imbalance.\nGietel-Basten, associate professor in social policy at Oxford University, says the births of many girls are not registered if parents have broken the rule by having two children, adding officials often turn a blind eye. It's estimated there are now 33 million more men than women in China.\n4: 2: 1 families\nWith the ageing of China's population and the continuation of the one-child policy, a \"4: 2 :1\" home is the description given to households in which there are four grandparent, cared for by two working age parents, who themselves have one child.\nBy 2050, it's predicted that a quarter of China's population will be 65 or older. The predicted decline in the number of people of working age is thought to have persuaded the government to drop the one-child policy.", "id": "high13182.txt"}
