It's hard work and it makes you short of breath. To fly over the channel takes only twenty minutes as long as you're not held up at the airport, but it's an expensive way to travel. You can travel by hovercraft  if you don't mind the noise and that takes forty minutes. Otherwise, you can go by boat, if you remember your sea-sickness pills. All these means of transport have their problems, and the weary traveler often dreams of being able to drive to France in his own car. \"Not possible, you say. Well, wait a minute. People are once again considering the idea of a channel tunnel or bridge.\" This time, the great London Council is looking into the possibility of building a channel link straight to London. A bridge would cost far more than a tunnel, but you would be able to make a journey by rail or by car on a bridge, yet a tunnel would provide a rail link only. Why is this idea being discussed again? Is Britain realizing the need for links with Europe as a result of joining EEC?Well, perhaps, the main reason, though, is that a tunnel or bridge would reach the twenty square kilometers of London's discussed dockland .  A link from London to the continent would stimulate  trade and revitalize the port, and would make London a main trading center in Europe. With a link over the Channel, you could buy your fish and chips in England and be able to eat them in France while they are still warm!", "id": "high9100.txt"}
