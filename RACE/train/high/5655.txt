During his visit, I happened to throw an old broken blender   in the trash. The next day it was sitting on my counter - in working order. In his world, people simply cannot afford to replace an item which doesn't work properly. They take the time and figure out how to fix it. In Cuba, they are still driving cars from the 1960's, mainly because they do not have a choice.\nIn contrast, the U.S. is a \"throw-away society.\" Statistics show that each American produces six pounds of trash per day. I believe a combination of factors has contributed to this phenomenon.\n\"Planned obsolescence \" is not a secret. It is a manufacturing   philosophy developed in the 1920's and 1930's, when mass production became popular. The goal is to make a product or part that will fail, or become less desirable over time or after a certain amount of use. This pressures the consumer to buy again.\nPlanned obsolescence does keep costs down. Instead of making an expensive product that will last a long time, businesses produce more affordable, disposable  items. Some electronic items have become so inexpensive that it is cheaper to replace them than to repair them.[:&&Z&X&X&K]\nBusy people often value their time and convenience more than money. If a car starts to have mechanical problems, replacing it with a newer, more reliable model may be more appealing than tolerating it being in the garage for a week.\nIn addition, advertising trains consumers to want what is new and improved. It convinces them that the more they have, the happier they will be.\nUnlike people in many developing countries, we live in a world of abundance. A study by Dr. Timothy Jones of the University of Arizona also found that in the U.S., 40-50 percent of all food ready for harvest is wasted. Abundance and waste soon became closely associated in the American way of life.", "id": "high5655.txt"}
