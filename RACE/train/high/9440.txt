A team of engineering scientists from Qatar University (QU) have taken a more high-tech approach to solving the problem - they've reportedly developed a type of artificial \"cloud\" designed to float above the World Cup venues and provide fans and players with relief from the blazing sun.\nThe artificial clouds system was invented by a team led by Dr Saul Abdul Ghani, Head of the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department at QU, who told Gulf News that the \"clouds\" would be made from a lightweight carbon structure carrying a giant envelope of material containing helium gas. The \"cloud\" would also feature solar panels on its upper surface to power engines that allow the cloud to be moved via remote control. While the country officials have promised to improve some of the issues with solar-powered stadiums capable of reducing the temperatures inside, to a comfortable 20degC, there is still concern of how the players will be able to function in the practice fields.\nThe system would initially cost around US$500,000, with prices coming down with commercial scale production. However, since Qatar needs to find a solution, the money is probably to the issue. The bigger question is, will this team of scientists actually be able to conjure up something that they have promised? We will all find out in about eleven years!", "id": "high9440.txt"}
