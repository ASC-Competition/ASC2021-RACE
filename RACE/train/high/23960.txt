Thus many are convinced that their dreams are prophetic because a few have come true; they  fail to notice the many that have not. Consider also the belief that \"the phone always rings when I'm in the shower. \" If it does ring while you are in the shower, the event will stand out and be remembered. If it doesn't ring, that nonevent probably won't even be remembered.\nPeople want to see order, pattern and meaning in the world. Consider, for example, the common belief that things like personal misfortunes, plane crashes, and deaths \"happen in threes. \" Such beliefs stem from the tendency of people to allow the third event to define the time period. I if three plane crashes occur in a month, then the period of time that counts as their \"happening together\" is one month; if three crashes occur in a year, the period of time is stretched. Flexible end strengthens such beliefs. \nWe also tend to believe what we want to believe. A majority of people think they are more intelligent, more fair-minded and more skilled behind the wheel of an automobile than the average person.
