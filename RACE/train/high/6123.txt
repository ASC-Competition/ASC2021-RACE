By 2018, 143,000 additional students will enter the already crowded public-education system. Gerner needs 73 new schools to house them. Four architecture teams have nearly finished designing primary school prototypes  ; they plan to construct their schools starting in 2009. The district will then assess how well the schools perform, and three winners will copy those designs in 50 to 70 new buildings.\nGreen schools are appearing all over, but in Clark County, which stands out for its vastness, such aggressive targets are difficult because design requirements like more natural light for students go against the realities of a desert climate. \"One of the biggest challenges is getting the right site orientation ,\" Mark. McGinty, a director at SH Architecture, says. His firm recently completed a high school in Las Vegas. \"You have the same building, same set of windows, but if its orientation is incorrect and it faces the sun, it will be really expensive to cool.\"\nSurprisingly, the man responsible for one of re most progressive green-design competitions has doubts about ideas of eco-friendly buildings. \"I don't believe in the new green religion,\" Gerner says. \"Some of the building technologies that you get are impractical. I'm interested in those that work.\" But he wouldn't mind if some green features inspire students. He says he hopes to set up green energy systems that allow them to learn about the process of harvesting wind and solar power. \"You never know what's going to start the interest of a child to study math and science,\" he says.", "id": "high6123.txt"}
