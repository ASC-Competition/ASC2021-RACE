That Saturday, the teacher wrote down the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper, and listed what everyone else had said about that _ . On Monday she gave each student his or her list. Before long, the entire class was smiling. \"Really?\" she heard whispered. \"I never knew that I meant anything to anyone!\" and, \"I didn't know others liked me so much,\" were most of the comments.\nNo one ever mentioned those papers in class again. She never knew if they discussed them after class or with their parents. Several years later, one of the students was killed in Vietnam and his teacher attended his funeral. As she stood there, one of the soldiers came up to her. \"Were you Mark's math teacher?\" he asked. She nodded: \"yes.\" Then he said: \"Mark talked about you a lot.\"\nAfter the funeral, Mark's mother and father were waiting there, \"We want to show you something,\" his father said, taking a wallet out of his pocket, \"They found this on Mark when he was killed. We thought you might recognize it.\"\nThe teacher carefully removed two worn pieces of notebook paper that had obviously been taped, folded and refolded many times. The teacher knew without looking that the papers were the ones on which she had listed all the good things each of Mark's classmates had said about him. \"Thank you so much for doing that,\" Mark's mother said, \"As you can see, Mark treasured it.\"\nThe density of people in society is so thick that we forget that life will end one day. And we don't know when that one day will be. So please, tell the people you love and care for, that they are special and important.", "id": "high6655.txt"}
