Public school kids surrounded by museums and monuments are putting the ready-made learning tools to use -- and actually learning.\nA trip to see painter Jacob Lawrence's Migration Series is one of almost 200 trips that Wheelock will organize this year through the nonprofit group Live It Learn It. \"For many kids, school is disconnected,\" says one of four full-time workers and tour leaders. \"With the program, they see how what they are learning is connected to their communities.\"\nSeven years ago, Wheelock changed a job as a lawyer for one as a four-grade teacher. When he learned that D.C.'s public schools ranked behind those of other cities in many ways, he knew he had to do something different. He took his class to Capitol Hill for a lesson on the three branches of government -- and saw his students' interest develop quickly.\nWith seed money from a local couple, Wheelock developed detailed lesson plans for trips to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Lincoln Memorial. The group also has classes for trips to the Anacostia River, boat rides to historical forts. Word spread, and now fourth, fifth, sixth graders from the neediest public schools in the District participate.\n\"I'm not brave enough to take my class to a museum for over an hour!\" says teacher Cathy McCoy, gesturing toward her students. \"But look With Live It Learn It, what the kids learn today they'll remember for a lifetime.\"", "id": "high6374.txt"}
