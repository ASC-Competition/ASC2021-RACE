If you are confused about your own feelings concerning a matter, it's best to stay quiet until you are more certain because more harm can be done by revealing false or exaggerated feelings\nChoose silence instead of blurting out 'in-the-moment' feelings that are hurtful and not really how you feel in the grand scheme of things. When you feel the urge to say an unkind thing, take a few breaths and think of the possible consequences of your words.\nSilence can be your best friend during negotiations. Say your piece, then close your mouth, and let the other person come to their own conclusions. Your silence shows that one, you are confident in what you just said, and two, you respect the other person enough to hear what they have to say.\nSometimes silence is the best and most timely solution because the other person is not in a position to hear what you have to say. For example, when a friend needs for you to listen to her problems, but she is unable to accept your advice at that moment.\nPractice being silent at work when you don't have anything meaningful to contribute. Unless you can elevate the conversation by pointing out something interesting, missing, or beneficial, it's best to just observe and learn.\nFinally, silence is golden when you don't want to engage in a fool's argument. As some squabbles will never be resolved, one must agree to disagree.\nHower,there will be times in your life where you will need the power of your voice,the voice within you that wants and needs to be respected and apprecitsed.", "id": "high7909.txt"}
