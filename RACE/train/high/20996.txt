Research in the sixties found the opposite. Bilingual people scored higher than monolinguals, people who speak only one language. So which is it?\nResearchers presented their newest studies last month at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The latest evidence shows that being bilingual does not necessarily make people smarter. But researcher Ellen Bialystok says it probably does make you better at certain skills.\nEllen Bialystok said, \"Imagine driving down the highway. There're many things that could\ncapture your attention and you really need to be able to monitor all of them. Why would bilingualism make you any better at that?\"\nAnd the answer, she says, is that bilingual people are often better at controlling their attention -- a function called the executive control system.\nMs. Bialystok is a psychology professor at York University in Toronto, Canada. She says the best method to measure the executive control system is called the Stroop Test. A person is shown words in different color1s. The person has to ignore the word but say the color1. The .problem is that the words are all names of color1s.\nEllen Bialystok said, \"So you would have the word blue written in red, but you have to say red. But blue is so salient , it's just lighting up all these circuits  in your brain, and you really want to say blue. So you need a mechanism  to  _ that so that you can say red. That's the executive control system.\"\nHer work shows that bilingual people continually practice this function. They have to, because both languages are active in their brain at the same time. They need to suppress  one to be able to speak in the other.\nThis mental exercise might help in other ways, too. Researchers say bilingual children are better able to separate a word from its meaning, and more likely to have friends from different\ncultures. Bilingual adults are often four to five years later than others in developing dementia or\nAlzheimer's disease.", "id": "high20996.txt"}
