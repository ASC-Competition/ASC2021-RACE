One afternoon, my eight-year-old sister Brittany and I were with the drama group rehearsing A Little Princess, a children's play. \"Good luck!\" I whispered as Brittany adjusted her boarding school costume.\n  \"Take your places for act one, please. Everyone, places for act one!\" called the director. The lights went out and the rehearsal began. Halfway through the first act, Brittany finished her part and went backstage. She grabbed her script from the table and read along with the rehearsal that was still going on in front of the curtain. A small group of fellow actors joined her, and started practicing lines. Suddenly, something wet exploded on the back of Brittany's head! Turning around, she saw a tall girl with a beverage bottle in her hand. Sticky blue liquid slid down Brittany's face. The older girl laughed . Brittany glanced at her, expecting someone else to speak up and defend her. However, they all screamed with laughter and pointed mocking fingers at Brittany, who ran out of the make-up room in dismay.  \nTen minutes later, Brittany met me backstage. \"A big girl just sprayed me with this stuff and laughed at me,\" she said, trying to wipe the liquid out of her curly hair. \"All the other girls laughed, too.\" I didn't even know the girl's name, and she was bullying my sister !\nWhen we got home, we looked at the cast list and found that the girl's name was Jessica. Our mom e-mailed the director, who said she would talk to Jessica and arrange time for an apology right before the next rehearsal. Nobody really expected a heartfelt apology from Jessica but Brittany was prepared to forgive her.\nBefore the next rehearsal, the director met Brittany at the door and announced that we had a problem on our hands. \"Jessica swears that she was never even near you yesterday,\" she said.\nBut Brittany knew the truth. As she glanced across the room full of young actors, she glimpsed Jessica sitting in a metal folding chair. For a split second, their eyes met. Jessica quickly turned away to stare in the opposite direction. For weeks afterwards, no matter how hard Brittany tried to talk to her, Jessica refused to look her way.\nIt was very difficult for Brittany to work with Jessica during every rehearsal , for three hours each week. But finally, we were ready to perform. There would be three performances over the course of the next weekend. Brittany and I were glad that the ordeal was almost over.\nAfter the first show, Brittany and I each got a beautiful bouquet from our church's pastor and his wife. Jessica didn't get a single flower. The second night, we received flowers from our grandparents. Again, Jessica received nothing.\nOn the way home, Brittany spoke up. \"Mommy\", she said quietly from the back seat of the car, \"I've been thinking, and I decided to buy some flowers for Jessica,\" Mom smiled in surprise and replied, \"That would be very nice.\"\nBefore the last performance, Brittany met Jessica on the way to the theater. She handed the older girl a big bunch of yellow roses, bought with her own savings. \"Great job with the show last night, Jessica. These are for you.\" Jessica was astonished. \"For me?\" she said. \"These flowers are for me? Are you sure?\" \"Yes I want you to have them!\" Brittany skipped towards the dressing room, leaving Jessica staring at her with a confused look on her face and a bouquet of beautiful flowers in her arms. \nThat night, Jessica finally received some flowers from her dad. She pulled out a spring of carnations and smiled shyly as she gave them to Brittany.\nMaybe Jessica will never apologize to Brittany. Maybe she won't ever even admit her mistake. But she is just beginning to realize what wonderful things a person's love does in people like Brittany.", "id": "high18343.txt"}
