It used long thin wire. It was invented in 1900 by Valdermar Poulsen. In 1930, German scientists invented the tape we use today. Back then the tape was on big rolls. In 1964 the Philips company in Holland invented the cassette. It's pretty much a holder for the tape. People use cassettes all over the world. If you don't have a cassette recorder, borrow one.\nThink of a book your parents read out loud to you. That might be a great book to read out loud to your mom or dad in their car. Put a cassette in the recorder, open the book, hit the record button and start reading out loud.\nRemember there is no such a thing as a wrong way to do this. You might think you've made a mistake, but this gift is part of you, and nothing about that can be a mistake. It's impossible.\nYou get to be all artistic and creative here. You might want to play music in the background. Do whatever you want. The gift is you, so you decide. Remember to say \"I love you\"at the end of your reading. That's like the prize at the end of the book.", "id": "high8378.txt"}
