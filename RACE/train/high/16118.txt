The black woman, however, turned the course of American history in December 1955 when she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. \"By sitting down, \"remarked John Lewis, \"she was standing up for all Americans. \"\nAmong the numerous awards Parks received in her life were the Presidential Medal of Freedom(1996)and the Congressional Gold Medal(1999).\nParks died on Oct. 24, 2005. At St. Paul A. M. E. Church in Montgomery, a large crowd including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice celebrated her life. Rice said she and others, who grew up when the political activities of Parks held public attention, might not have realized her impact on their lives, \"but I can honestly say that without Mrs. Parks, I probably would not be standing here as Secretary of State. \"\nAfter her casket was placed at the Capitol, U. S. President Bush, members of Congress and ordinary Americans paid their respects. In American history Parks is the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol, a very high regard usually reserved for Presidents of the United States.", "id": "high16118.txt"}
