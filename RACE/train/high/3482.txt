He is very brave and always helps others in need.\nOn March 26, 2012, Zhang donated bone marrow   at the Navy General Hospital of Beijing. He is the youngest and the first high school student to do it. Last April, Zhang became a blood donor on his 18th birthday. He also joined the China Marrow Donor Program that day. Six months later, his bone marrow was chosen as a match for a 4-year-old leukemia   patient from Fujian.\nZhang was studying for the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) when the call from the Chinese Bone Marrow Donors came. He found out that the patient could not wait, or things might get worse. With the support of his family and school, Zhang arrived at the hospital in Beijing the very next day.\n\"Saving a life is more important than taking an exam, and having the chance to help cure a patient does not allow for more thought,\" Zhang said.\nThe transplant operation   was a success. After that, Zhang Wenchi was in good health and he came back to school soon. Zhang said then the most important task for him was the exam. He hoped that his dream of becoming a pilot could come true.\nNow the NCEE has been over for more than a month, and what about Zhang Wenchi's marks? To our great relief, it's known that he has earned 540 points, which means he can be admitted into Beihang University (formerly Beijing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics). Therefore he can realize his dream of flying in the sky.\nZhang's deed has earned him nationwide respect, and some have given him the nickname, \"the most beautiful post-90s student\".", "id": "high3482.txt"}
