Even if you know the meaning of each word you see or hear, you may not understand the idiom because you don't understand the culture behind it.\nFor example, if an American boy asks his mother what's for dinner tomorrow, she may say \"I'll play it by ear\", that means she doesn't have plans for dinner and she will decide later. \"Play by ear\" used to mean playing music using the sheet music, but now people often use it when they're not talking about music.\nThere're many idioms in English. If you learn to use them, your English will be more vivid and colorful. English idioms are more common in spoken English. They can be difficult to remember sometimes. Next time when you hear somebody saying to you, \"Give me a hand\", you don't necessarily stretch out your hand to him/her, but you do need to be helpful. And when the situation is out of hand, you usually can do very little to manage all that. What about a green hand? It's not about the color of your hand! You're a green hand when you are very new at your work and don't have much experience. If you and your partner always work together hand in glove, you two definitely work together very well.\nCan you guess the meanings of some common English idioms to do with parts of your body?", "id": "high165.txt"}
