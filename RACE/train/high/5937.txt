The fires were driven by high winds,moving as many as ten miles a day.Many small animals died in the flames.The fires' rapid advances gave the wildlife little chance to escape. Even today,few of these small forest animals have returned to live in the park. In the years immediately following the fires,the numbers of visitors declined rapidly.No one was interested in seeing a blackened and treeless park on vacation.Yellowstone had previously been famous for its amazing views and unique geological formations such as the geyser Old Faithful. But now its reputation as America's wonder is damaged permanently.", "id": "high5937.txt"}
