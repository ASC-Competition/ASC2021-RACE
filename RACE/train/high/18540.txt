She was leaving her native country to join her sister in the United States. She spoke English very well. Though she was very happy she could go abroad, she was feeling sad at leaving her family and friends. As she was thinking all about this, she suddenly heard the airline employee asking her to pick up her luggage and put it on the scales . Maria pulled and pulled.

If you are in such a hurry, why can't you give me a hand with my luggage?\"\n  The man was surprised to hear Maria speak English. He quickly picked up her luggage and stepped back.
