Millions of dollars are spent on the marketing of a perfume, trying to get customers to connect attraction or attitude to a fragrance.\nEven without the marketing, fragrance has power over our thoughts and feelings. Some scientists insist that memory and smell are especially closely linked. Certain aromas have the power to call up deep memories. Perfume makers are aware of this and use aromas that can touch us deeply.\nThe Power of Aromas\nOf every ten new perfumes put on the market, perhaps only one will succeed. It's risky to try, as a company introducing a new fragrance can easily run through a budget of 20 million dollars. Profits , however, can be very high. One successful fragrance, CK One from designer Calvin Klein, made 250 million dollars in its first year.\nIn the perfume world, the most basic and important quality is the material with its own special aroma. Some are natural, coming from flowers, plants, or wood, for example. Others are synthetic materials, that is, the materials which are not natural but made with the help of science. According to expert perfumer Harry Fremont, a good fragrance \"is a balance between naturals and synthetics\".\nImage and Marketing\nSephora is France's leading perfume store. In a store of shining stone, metal, and glass, famous perfumes are shown and guarded like works of art in the nearby Louvre Museum. Salespeople are dressed in black, and each type of perfume is sold in a particularly shaped bottle. In perfume sales, the importance is on presentation at least as much as on the product.\nIf you're confused about which perfume to buy, perfumer Annie Buzantian offers her advice: you really can't get an idea whether a perfume works or not until you wear it. \"It's like the difference between a dress on the hanger on the hanger and a dress on your body,\" says Buzantian. \"Your first impression is often the right one.\"", "id": "high18995.txt"}
