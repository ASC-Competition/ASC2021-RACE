You will have to take a number of measures so that your hike is a pleasant experience. \nHiking Tip 1 -- Start Early\nMost hiking experts hold the opinion that it is rather sensible to start hiking at 3 or 4 in the morning, even if it is a full-day hike. Since most hikes are conducted at high altitudes, starting off early will make sure that you are back down during the afternoon hours.   \nHiking Tip 2 -- Be Light\nSince we are anyway talking about the load you will carry, another important hiking tip is to carry fewer loads. If you are going on a hiking trail on a familiar path, you will need reduced survival items, as chance that you will get lost or hurt yourself on these hiking trails is little. \nHiking Tip 3 -- Reduce the Number of Breaks\nOnce you start your hike, you should make sure you do not take too many breaks. You will need to maintain a consistent speed and minimize the number of stops which you take. Speed and rest stops help distinguish an inexperienced hiker from an expert hiker. An inexperienced hiker will have bursts of speed and energy and it will be followed by rest stops. This results in slowing down the general speed.\nHiking Tip 4 -- Tip for Children\nDo you plan to take your kids along with you on the hiking trail? Well, then you must be looking for hiking tips for kids! You will have to educate them about nature and also get them into an exercise routine before taking them on a hike. Kids have a tendency to run in the beginning. This exhausts them and they have to be carried, which is certainly not the best of ideas.", "id": "high19631.txt"}
