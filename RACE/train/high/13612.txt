Rather, they say that achieving passion for your work is something you can develop over time.\nUnlike the main way of thinking that you'Il only achieve passion for your work through finding the right fit with a line of work - what the researchers call \"fit theory\" , the researchers say you can learn to love your job and find meaning in it gradually(\"developing theory\").\nWe probably hear and think a l.t more about \"fit theory\" than \"developing theory\" because we've become used to it. \"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work,\" said Steve Jobs. \"And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'II know when you find it. \"\nChen and colleagues examined some students' career attitudes and expectations with regard to \"fit theory\"and \"developing theory\". \"People can achieve similar levels of passion at work by accepting either the fit or develo-ping theory. The key difference lies in how these results are reached : fit theorists   tend to self-select into lines of work that fit them from the start, while developing theorists grow into that fit over time. \"\nFit theorists tend to value enjoyment at the expense of good pay, while developing theorists are willing to let enjoyment take a back seat to other goals, safe in the knowledge that they'll grow into the role and find enjoyment over time.\nEveryone has moments of being bored with their work,but it's important to keep your thoughts focused on the bigger picture, your Iong-term goals , and whv you took the role in the first place.", "id": "high13612.txt"}
