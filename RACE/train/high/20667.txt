Farmer Joe was in his cart when he was hit by a truck. He decided his injuries from the accident were serious enough to take the trucking company (which caused the accident)to court. In court the trucking company's lawyer was questioning Farmer Joe. \"Didn't you say, at the same scene of the accident, 'I'm fine'?\" said the lawyer.\nFarmer Joe responded, \"Well, I will tell you what happened.

Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to cover the fact. I believe he is telling lies. Please tell him to simply answer the question.\"\nBy this time the Judge was fairly interested in Farmer Joe's answer and said to the lawyer, \"I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite mule Bessie.\"\nJoe thanked the Judge and went on, \"Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite mule, into the cart and was driving her down the road when this huge truck ran into the stop sign and pushed my cart right in the side. I was thrown into one side and Bessie was thrown into the other.\"\n\"I was hurt so badly that I didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie breathing loudly and groaning  .

He said, \"Your mule was in such pain that I had to shoot her. How are you feeling?\"", "id": "high20667.txt"}
