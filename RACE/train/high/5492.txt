The character is a crocodile hunter, hence the nickname.\nIn the first film, Crocodile Dundee, Mick is visited by a New York reporter, Sue Charlton, who travels to Australia to investigate a report she heard of a crocodile hunter, who had his leg bitten off by a crocodile in the outback. The hunter supposedly walked more than a hundred miles back to civilization and miraculously survived his injuries. However, by the time she meets him, the story turns out to be a somewhat exaggerated legend where the \"bitten-off leg\" turns out to be just being some bad scarring on his leg; a \"love bite\" as Mick calls it. Still _ by the idea of \"Crocodile Dundee\", Sue continues with the story. They travel together out to where the incident occurred, and follow his route through the bush to the nearest hospital. Despite his old-fashioned views, the pair eventually become close, especially after Mick saves Sue from a crocodile attack.\nFeeling there is still more to the story, Sue invites Mick back to New York with her, as his first trip to a city (or \"first trip anywhere,\" as Dundee says). The rest of the film depicts Dundee as a \"fish out of water,\" showing how, despite his expert knowledge of living outdoors, he knows little of city life. Mick meets Sue's boyfriend, Richard, but they do not get along. By the end of the film, Mick is on his way home, lovesick, when Sue realizes she loves Mick, too, and not Richard. She runs to the subway station to stop Mick from leaving and, by passing on messages through the packed-to-the-gills crowd, she tells him she won't marry Richard, and she loves him instead. With the help of the other people in the subway, Mick and Sue have a loving reunion as the film ends.", "id": "high5492.txt"}
