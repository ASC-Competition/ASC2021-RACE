Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so rapidly that they will not survive for future generations.\nThe mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer, is scattered   with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields   and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti  .\nJean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, \"People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.\"\nHe describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition   of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even cut off parts to take home as souvenirs. \"When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,\" he said. \"The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub them to make them look fresher.\" Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch   their own drawings, or even their names, in the rocks.\nBut experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a \"no-go\" area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Otherwise, he says, not only will the site be completely destroyed but important research work will be reduced.\nClottes disagrees, \"The measure suggested by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,\" he said. \"The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.\"\nDavid Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. \"Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,\" he said. \"Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is money. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. It doesn't seem to be possible to get the government support.\"\nIn Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is alarmed that as the mountain becomes easier to reach -- tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles -- the damage will increase rapidly. She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides. \"You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,\" she said. \"That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation.\"", "id": "high8097.txt"}
