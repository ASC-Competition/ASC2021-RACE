If we continue to burn oil and pump carbon into the atmosphere, then the effects on global climate will lead to global disasters even before the oil disappear.\nThe British government has set a target of a 20 percent reduction in carbon emission by 2010. Central to this policy is the search for alternative, renewable forms of energy production---and this is where the serious disagreement among scientists begins.\nHere, two people active in the debate about wind farms give their points of view.\nSimon Shearman\n\"First, a few facts about wind power. Wind is one of the cheapest of the new, renewable forms of energy. It is extremely safe---no member of the public has ever been injured at a wind farm. The shallow waters around Britain are the windiest in Europe---ideal locations for wind farms and, by 2010, up to ten percent of the electricity used in the UK could be produced by wind power. I find it annoying and frustrating that the biggest objection that opponents of wind farms can come up with is that the crisis of global warming is real and something must be done urgently.\"\nAlice Evans\n\"The simple, obvious fact is that wind turbines  cannot generate electricity if the wind is too light or too strong and it often is. Many scientists estimate that wind turbines generally produce only 30 percent of their capacity . This is not a reliable enough supply to enable us to close down conventional power stations. In fact, wind power can't keep up with the growth of the demand for electricity, let alone replace other sources of power.\"\nIt's a topic that is causing heated debate around the country---but one we must address before it's too late---before the oil runs out.", "id": "high9402.txt"}
