She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm. Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss. It was pretty cool. \n     Rachel was there thanks to Facemail. Facemail lets you send email that gets read to the receiver by an attractive male or female form. The free software can be downloaded at www.facemail.com, and you can choose different faces.\n     The basic idea is pretty clever. The Facemail people have taken biologically based imaging and used it to create lifelike digital faces. The voice reading the email is standard. \n And Facemail will get more interesting. Soon you can have your own voice read the email you send. The company has signed a deal with Kodak and next year you can submit your photo and your own face will be the one reading your email. \n     LifeFX, the company that produces Facemail, says that one reason e-commerce is struggling is that buying over the Internet lacks the human touch. But what if you went to the Nike website and Michael Jordan greeted you by name and waited on you? The company will also use Facemail to make greeting cards and living wedding albums. \n    Personally, I'm a fan of Facemail. But Facemail should be used carefully. If you select an angry face, put a few harsh words and add some angry emotions, you've got Psycho-mail.", "id": "high22693.txt"}
