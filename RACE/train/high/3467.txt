Recently, The Daily Telegraph ran a humorous piece on untrue tech moments from some top movies. Let's see what they are all about.\nTom Chiver, the writer of The Daily Telegraph uses his first example from the movie Independence Day, in which a character comes up with a virus which destroys Windows the computer system the alien  spacecraft uses. \"It's a good thing that they didn't have Norton Anti-virus,\" jokes  Chivers.\nIt's just one case of a movie that takes a lot of license with its science. Another one Chivers mentions is from the movie Star Wars, where the glowing light beams  traveling through space look very impressive. But the problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd be invisible , which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen.\nMost people think that the mind--bending Matrix films are made for great viewing. But for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little bit silly. He comments \"...the film is based on the idea that humans are kept alive as electricity generators  . This is not just unlikely --it's basically impossible. _ would need more energy to stay alive than they would produce. It's just like saying that you'll power the car with batteries, and keep the batteries charged by running a generator from the wheels. \"\nAnd finally, as Chivers points out, DNA is not replaceable. But this bit of elementary genetics passed the makers of the 2002 Bond film Die Another Day by. In the film the bad guy has \"gene treatment\" to change his appearance and his DNA, which is completely impossible in our real world.", "id": "high3467.txt"}
