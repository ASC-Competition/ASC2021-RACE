With an ageing population, the biggest challenge is dealing with the rising number of elderly motorists. By 2021, there will be an estimated three million drivers over the age of 70 on Britain's roads.\nDrivers must renew their licenses at the age of 70 and every three years thereafter. The applicant is legally required to tell the DVLA of any conditions that could weaken their ability behind the wheel.\nMinisters have ruled out a compulsory maximum age for driving but will instead rely on tightening up the checks on motorists over the age of 75. The most likely option would be tests to ensure motorists were fit to drive. They would include an eyesight test and a cognitive  test that would prove a driver's ability to react to road signs, driving conditions, pedestrians and vehicles.\nHowever, checks are likely to be tightened at all ages. The strictest controls are expected to be imposed  on motorists of any age who have had a heart attack or stroke. They could have to produce a doctor's approval to resume driving. Anyone making a false declaration would be guilty of a criminal offence.", "id": "high3937.txt"}
