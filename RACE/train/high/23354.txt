But at times, some things look very minor but their result can be really powerful. Here are some of the efforts which can change the relationship between parents and children.\nPat your child when he loses:May it be failure in the class, or on the field, speak words of encouragement to your child. The trust and confidence in your relationship will go to another level. After all, words of encouragement during failure are more valuable than words of praise after success.\nGive him importance, like a member of the family:Hang his painting in your room or in the office, take his opinion when you are buying furniture for the house. Your child will believe in himself and be a winner throughout.\nShare your own experience when your child makes a mistake:When you see your child lying or stealing, share with him the mistakes you made in your life. He' 11 know it is all right to make mistakes and that he can share with you anything.\nAppreciate at least one quality in your child every day:Each day look at what qualities your child possesses and appreciate him, maybe for his caring attitude, his dance skills or his observation power. Tell him how proud you are of him because of those qualities.\nBecome his age before bedtime:Jump on the bed, have pillow fights, act silly, dance--become a child with your child for sometime. You' 11 forget all your day's stress.\nTry these minor things; you' 11 see the love deepen and the relationship blossom.", "id": "high23354.txt"}
