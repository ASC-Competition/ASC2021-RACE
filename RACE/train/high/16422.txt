Inside the bottle was a scrawled letter from Zoe Lemon, a youngster with a love of \"ballet, playing the flute and the piano\", who had just boarded a ship heading for a holiday in Germany.\nShe told her expected recipients of her pet hamster and fish, both called Sparkle, and her parents who were both teachers.\nMiss Lemon, of Salford, Greater Manchester, soon forgot about her act of fantastic, eventually marrying and having a child herself.\nBut this Christmas she was extremely surprised to receive a reply after 23 years.\nIt turned out to be a reply to her letter from Piet and Jacqueline Lateur from near Rotterdam. Mr Lateur was walking his dog in the Oosterschelde dykes , near where he and his wife live in Serooskerke, when he found the bottle with Zoe's letter inside.\nMrs Averianov, 33, who works in a jewellery shop, said: \"It's been a bit crazy really. My parents came to visit on Christmas day and they had this letter from Europe addressed to my\n, Lemon.\nSince receiving the letter, Mrs Averianov has been in contact with Mr Lateur via email and asked to see photographs of where the bottle was found.\nHe told her: \"I am keeping your little letter on my piano. I know you are no longer a little girl but you asked me to write you so I have.\"\nMrs Averianov's father, John Lemon, 68, had encouraged his daughter to throw the message into the sea on a family holiday and now she is considering doing the same for her five-year-old son Maksim.\nShe said: \"I'll probably wait until he's a bit older and can understand and write a letter, but maybe we'll do it by attaching it to a balloon.\"\nFrom\n, (Jan,2014)", "id": "high16422.txt"}
