You turn to your best side and click.\nThere it is - your selfie.\nOver the past year, \"selfie\" has become a well-known term across the globe. This August the Oxford dictionary added the word to their online dictionary and define it as: \"A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.\"\nToday it's not difficult to find social networking pages full of photos people have taken of themselves and their friends.
