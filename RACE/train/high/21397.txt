While relaxing and enjoying the aloneness, I sensed a battle for favorable position between the highly-spirited water and the large rocks resting on the bed along the edges of the stream.\nAt first; the rocks, stubborn, immovable and unbending, seemed to have their way with their adversary  . However, the water, determined yet forgiving, seemed merely inconvenienced by the presence of the rocks, as it effortlessly changed its course, running towards its original destination.\nSoon it became clear that the rocks, although remaining strong and firm, were losing this battle as the water's total indifference began to slowly reform these obstacles   into smooth and beautifully polished stones.\nYou see, there seemed to be total lack of struggle associated with the water's journey. Struggle is like bondage   forcing harmony and the water would have none of that. On the contrary,the water seemed perfectly content to move around the rocks when necessary, following some route God had originally intended.\nI paused for thought. Maybe people need to be more determined and less stubborn. Maybe human beings need to always be open to different points of view, not afraid to readjust their direction as life presents all of its new and unforeseen challenges.", "id": "high21397.txt"}
