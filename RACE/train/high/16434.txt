Using the same technology as a dehumidifier  , the Water Mill is able to create a ready supply of drinking water by getting it from a limitless source-the air. The company behind the machine says not only does it offer all alterative to bottled water in developed countries,but it is a solution for the millions who face a daily water shortage.\nThe machine works by drawing in damp air through a filter  and over a cooling element which changes it into water droplets.It can produce up to 12 liters a day.The Water Mill will also produce more water when storms pass over, as the humidity in the air increases.In keeping with its ecodevelopment,the machine uses the same amount of electricity as three light bulbs.\nInventor Jonathan Ritchey said:\"The demand for water is\n.People are looking for freedom from water distribution systems that are shaky and unreliable\".\nThe machine,which is about 3 feet wide,is likely to costPS800 when it goes on sale here in the spring.Its maker, Canadian firm Element Four, estimates that a liter of water will cost around 20 pence to produce.\nEnvironmentalists claim half the world's population will face water shortage because of climate change by 2080.One in five humans is said to lack access to safe drinking water.\nThe Water Mill is not effective in areas with below about 30 percent relative humidity, but with average relative humidity in England of more than 70 percent that won't be much of an issue here.", "id": "high16434.txt"}
