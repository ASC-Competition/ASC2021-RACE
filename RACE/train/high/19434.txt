But exciting things can happen when we actually believe in ourselves. Here is a man who believed in his own ability even as a boy, and that confidence helped shape his adult life.\nAt the turn of the last century, a young boy quit school to help with the family expenses. When he was fifteen, he became interested in automobiles  and worked in a garage. He subscribed to a correspondence home study course on automobiles and, after a long day in the garage, studied at the kitchen table by lamplight.\nWhen he felt ready, he walked into the Frayer-Miller Automobile Company of Columbus, Ohio. When Mr. Frayer noticed him, he asked, \"Well, what do you want?\"\n\"I just thought I'd tell you I'm coming to work here tomorrow morning,\" the boy replied.  \n\"Oh! Who hired you?\"\n\"Nobody yet, but I'll be on the job in the morning. If I'm not worth anything, you can fire me.\"\nEarly the next morning the young man returned to the plant. Noticing the floor was thick with metal shavings and accumulated dirt, the boy got a broom and set out to clean the place. \nBecause of his self-confidence and work ethic, the boy's future was predictable. He went on to stand out in many fields, including automobile racing, piloting World War I planes and founding what was to become one of America's largest airline companies -- Eastern Airlines.\nPeople who become more confident habitually encourage themselves. Without confidence, we are not likely to move far in the direction of our dreams. But become our own best friend and almost anything will be possible. It is important that we always believe in ourselves. In order to reach victory, we must believe in ourselves even when we make mistakes and fall short.", "id": "high19434.txt"}
