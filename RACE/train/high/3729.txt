Participants rated how much they enjoyed the chocolate and described each flavor so that the researchers could record the order in which the randomly   selected treats were eaten.\nVolunteers were assigned to the \"next\" or the \"last \" condition by chance.\nIn the \"next\" condition, the experimenter said \"Here is your next chocolate\" before offering each chocolate, including the fifth.\nFor the \"last\" condition, the experimenter said \"Here is your last chocolate\" before offering  the fifth chocolate.\nThese participants rated the fifth chocolate more enjoyable than volunteers in the \"next\" condition.\nAs predicted, participants who knew they were eating the final chocolate of a taste test enjoyed it more.\nIn fact, when asked to pick their favorite chocolate, the majority of \"last\" participants chose the fifth - even though the flavor of the fifth was randomly chosen.\nThey also rated the overall experience as more enjoyable than volunteers who thought they were just eating one more chocolate in a series.\nO'Brien says these findings may have far-reaching implications. For example, the last book or film in a series or the last speaker in a symposium   may receive _ praise.\nThe last job applicant, meanwhile, may look more qualified.", "id": "high3729.txt"}
