Winston Churchill once joked that the people of Britain and the people of America are separated   only by their language. Do you think that is true? The British and the Americans both speak English as the official language. However, each uses some different words.We Americans are similar to the British. After all , our country was once owned by Great Britain , so we have a lot in common. But there are many differences between us.\nGreat Britain has a king or queen, and the leader of the government is the Prime Minister. The United States has no kings or queens. Our leader is the President.\nBoth the British and Americans use pounds and ounces, oints, quarts, and gallons. Both use miles, yards,and feet. Our money is different,though. The British use pounds and pence. Americans use dollars and cents.\nDriving in a car is very different in England. They drive on the left side of the road. We drive on the right. What we call the hood of the car, the British call the \"bonnet\". British cars run on \"petrol\",which we call gasoline.\nIn our everyday lives, we do many of the same things as the British. But we describe them differently. A young mother here might push a baby in a baby carriage. A British mom pushes a \"pram\". The British watch the \"telly\", while we watch TV. We like to eat French fries, but the British call them \"chips\". Millions of Americans drink coffee, but most British prefer tea.\nSo we are different in many ways. But we stay friendly anyway.", "id": "high8651.txt"}
