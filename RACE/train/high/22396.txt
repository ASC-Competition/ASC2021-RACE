Being born in a certain month appears to indicate the possibility of what job a person will end up with, the study by the Office for National Statistics found.\n    Researchers have uncovered that the month in which babies are born could also affect everything from intelligence to length of life. A child born in December is more likely to become a dentist while someone whose birthday falls in January will tend to a debt collector, they found.\n    A February birth appears to increase the chances of being an artist while March babies appear to go on to become pilots. Meanwhile, April and May are said to have a fairly even spread of professions, births in the summer months mean a much lower chance of becoming a high-earning football player, doctor or dentist. The study was gained by researchers who analyzed the birth months of people in 19 separate occupations using information from the last census  , the Daily Mail reported. Although these trends may be difficult to explain, relations between birth months and specific health problems have a scientific basis.\n    Spring babies are at greater risk of illnesses including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, asthma and autism. They may also be less clever than classmates born in other parts of the year. (http://www.ebigear.com/news-115-76605.html)", "id": "high22396.txt"}
