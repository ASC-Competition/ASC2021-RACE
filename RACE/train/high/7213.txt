In this month's newsletter ,Peter Turner,the head teacher,warned that any cards found in school would be confiscated .He wrote:\"We do not wish to see any Valentine's Day cards in school this year. Some children and parents encourage a lot of talk about boyfriends and girlfriends. We believe that such ideas should wait until children are mature enough emotionally and socially to understand the commitment involved in having or being a boyfriend or girlfriend.\"Mr.Turner said any families wanting to support the Valentine's Day idea should send cards in the post or deliver them to home addresses by hand.\nHis views were _ by Ruth Rice,46,who has twins Harriet and Olivia at the school. She said,\"Children at that age shouldn't really be thinking about Valentine's Day,they should be concentrating on their schoolwork.\"They are at an age when they are impressionable and most parents including myself are with Mr.Turner. \"She added that the cards cause\" too much competition. If someone gets a card and another doesn't,then someone will be disappointed.\nHowever,Rajeev Takyar,40,who has two children Jai,11,and Aryan,five,at the school,said he was \"outraged\".He said,\"There are schools that have banned conkers and snowballs,and now Valentine's Cards.\"I think banning the cards stops children from having social skills. How are they going to learn about relationships otherwise?It's ridiculous. Alec Suttenwood,father of three children,said of the ban:\"It's totally ridiculous. Young children just send the cards to each other as friends and to their parents. It's just a bit of harmless fun. There is no difference between this and Mother's or Father's Day.\"", "id": "high7213.txt"}
