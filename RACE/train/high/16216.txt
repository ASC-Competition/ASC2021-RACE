For most people, it means some new clothes for work or a small trinket for a friend. For others, however, shopping is much more than an enjoyable pastime, and in some cases, it is a real and destructive addiction that can turn into a financial disaster. Compulsive shopping and spending are defined as inappropriate, excessive, and out of control. Like other addictions, it basically has something to do with impulsiveness and lack of control over one's impulses. In America, shopping is embedded in our culture; so often, the impulsiveness comes out as excessive shopping. Sometimes this is referred to as \"shopholism\". Shopping addiction can damage a person's life, family, and finances. \"No one knows what causes addictive behaviors, like shopping, alcoholism, drug abuse, and gambling\", says a professor of applied health science. Some of the new evidence suggests that some people, maybe 10%-15%, may have a genetic predisposition to an addictive behavior, coupled with an environment in which the particular behavior is triggered, but no one really knows why.\" Individuals will get some kind of high from an addictive behavior like shopping.\nWhat are the telltale signs that shopping has crossed the line and become and addiction? What should a concerned family member or friend look out for when they think shopping has become a problem? The behaviors can signal a serious problem:\n*Shopping or spending money as a result of feeling angry, depressed, anxious, or lonely\n*Having arguments with others about one's shopping habits\n*Feeling lost without credit cards -- actually going into withdrawal without them\n*Buying items on credit, rather than with cash\n*Describing a rush or a feeling of euphoria with spending\n*Feeling guilty, ashamed, or embarrassed after a spending spree \n*Thinking obsessively about money\n*Spending a lot time juggling accounts or bills to accommodate spending\n\"If someone identifies four or more of any of these behaviors, there may be a problem\", experts say. Treating a shopping addiction requires a multifaceted approach. There are no standard treatments for shopping addiction. Medications have been used, but with mixed results. Therapists also focus on cognitive-behavioral treatment programs. There is no quick and easy answer that will immediately cure a shopping addiction, and while treatment is a necessary part of solving the problem, so is behavior change on the part of the addict.\nSome basic changes in behavior that will have a big impact on breaking a shopping addiction are recommended:\n*Admit that you are a compulsive spender, which is half the battle.\n*Get rid of checkbooks and credit cards, which fuel the problem.\n*Don't shop by yourself because most compulsive shoppers shop alone and if you are with someone you are much less likely to append more.\n*Find other meaningful ways to spend time.\nAnd keep in mind that while behavior change is clearly important to recovery, so is reaching out for professional help.(509)", "id": "high16216.txt"}
