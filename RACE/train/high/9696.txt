Across the street was a gas station, which was closed for Christmas, but I noticed a family standing under the narrow overhang to keep dry. I wondered briefly why they were there but then forgot about them as I couldn't wait to see my gifts.\nOnce I got home, there was hardly any time to enjoy my gifts. My grandparents were still waiting for us to have Christmas dinner together at their house. As we drove down the highway, I noticed that the family was still there.\nThe closer we got to my grandparents' house, the slower the car went. Suddenly, my father U-turned and said, \"I can't stand it!\" \"What?\" asked my mother. \"It's those people back there at the gas station, standing in the rain.\"\nWhen my father pulled into the station, I saw there were five of them: the parents and three children--two girls and a small boy. Then we learned that the family was waiting for the bus to Birmingham, where the man planned to find a job.\n\"Well, that bus won't come along for several hours. Winborn's just a few miles away, and there is a shed  with a cover there,\" my father advised. \"I will run you up there.\"\nThen they climbed into our car,. My father looked back and asked the children if Father Christmas had found them. Three sad faces gave him his answer.\n\"Well, Father Christmas said he was having trouble finding you, so he just left your toys at my house this morning. Let's go to get them first,\" my father said. All at once, the three children's faces lit up.\nWhen we arrived at our house, one girl spied a lovely doll, that little boy took a ball, and the other girl picked up something else. That was the Christmas when I learned the joy of making others happy.", "id": "high9696.txt"}
