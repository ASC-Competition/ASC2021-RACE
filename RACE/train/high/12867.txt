The 84-year-old's route to the honour has been anything but traditional. In China, she is being called the \"three nos\" winner: no medical degree, no doctorate, and she's never worked overseas.\nIn 1967, malaria, a then deadly disease, spread by mosquitoes was _ Chinese soldiers fighting Americans in the jungles of northern Vietnam. A secret research unit \"Mission 523 \"was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of \"Mission 523\".\n\"Mission523\" read ancient books carefully for a long time to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, more than 240,000 compounds  around the world had already been tested, without any success. Finally, the team found a brief reference to one substance, sweet wormwood , which had been used to treat malaria in China around 400 AD. The team took out one active compound in wormwood, and then tested it. But nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text. After another careful reading, she changed the drug recipe one final time, heating the compound without allowing it to reach boiling point.\nAfter the drug showed promising results in mice and monkeys, Tu Youyou volunteered to be the first human recipient of the new drug. \"\nIn any case, Tu Youyou is consistently praised for her drive and passion. One former colleague. Lianda Li, says Ms Tu is \"unsociable and quite straightforward\", adding that \"if she disagrees with something, she will say it.\"\nAnother colleague, Fuming Liao, who has worked with Tu Youyou for more than 40 years, describes her as a \"tough and stubborn woman\". Stubborn enough to spend decades piecing together ancient texts, she applies them to modern scientific practices. The result has saved millions of lives.", "id": "high12867.txt"}
