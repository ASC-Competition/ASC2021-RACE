Probably -not. Not many  Londoners know it either, but Henri does and he is willing to show it to you.\nHenri used to sleep in parks until he met a charity  that helps homeless people get  back on their feet by becoming tour guides.\nRather than show traditional London sights, \"Unseen Tours\" t _ Henri has been teaching tourists about the history and architecture of Shoreditch, where he slept on public benches for three years.\nWhen he felt separated from the society, contact with the volunteer network \"The Sock Mob\" gave Henri hope. \"Not everyone just looked down on me,\" he said. The tours aren't the only actions trying to help those who have suffered a misfortune to stand tall again.\nAn innovative  college for homeless people in London, the first of its kind in the country, is attracting hundreds of students. The Recovery College, set up by St Mungo's charity, is providing courses designed to improve technical skills and life skills.\nAccording to Andy Williams, who helps to organize the college, the most popular courses have proved to be about raising self-confidence and developing self-pride.\nSteve, now in his 50s, told a reporter how much of a difference it makes to \"have a bit of confidence\". He had difficulty learning to read and had to leave school when he was 12. Because Steve's problem was not recognized at the time, he was \"seen to be unable to read or write\", and suffered with depression and alcohol addiction. He says the status of \"student\" is itself important for people who are used to being treated as outcasts \nSome charities aim not only to help the homeless become independent but also to make them popular. The Homeless World Cup started ten years ago. Today the tournament draws teams from 48 countries made up of players-men and women-who are, or have been, living in the streets.  It gives them a chance to become football heroes.", "id": "high4882.txt"}
