Some say it's a town of fools. Others say all the villagers are wise. Let me tell you about the people of Gotham so you can decide for yourself.\nLong ago, England was ruled by a cruel king named John. One day, the people of Gotham heard that King John and his men would soon be riding through their town.This worried the villagers, for they knew the greedy king would demand food and accommodation for his men. What's more, if he saw anything to his liking, he would surely take it.\nA town meeting was called. After much discussion, the townspeople decided to cut down a number of huge trees to block the roads leading into Gotham. When King John and his men reached the outskirts of the village, they could not pass. Angry, King John ordered his men to go into the town and punish the villagers.\nWhen the king's officers finally made their way over the trees, they found a village of fools. Some say that was because the people of Gotham had a plan--they had decided to act like fools since they had never heard of anyone being punished for being a noodlehead. Others say that's just the way they were.\nIn the village, the king's men encountered a man riding a donkey. The man was bent over because he carried a huge bag of grain on his own shoulders. He looked exhausted. One of the king's men approached him and asked, \"Why, in heaven's name, are you carrying that bag? Why don't you just put it behind you on your donkey's back?\"\n\"You see,\" replied the man from Gotham, \"my donkey is feeling poor today. It's bad enough that she has to carry me, so I decided to lighten her burden by carrying the bag myself.\"\nThe king's men said, \"But sir, don't you see that if you're riding on top of the donkey, she's\nstill carrying the weight of the bag?\" The man didn't reply. He just looked at the king's men as if  they were crazy and went on his way. The king's officers giggled at the foolishness of the man. Before long, they passed a pond where they found a number of villagers in the midst of a great  argument. Two of them were holding a big eel. \"Quiet down,\" commanded one of the king's men. \"What's the problem here?\"\nOne of the villagers stepped forward and said, \"Last year we took all the extra fish we [caught and put them in this pond so they would multiply. But this year when we came back, all we  caught was this one huge eel. Obviously it has eaten all of our fish! Since then, we have argued long and hard over how to punish this bad eel. But we have finally agreed on the perfect punishment. We are just about to drown the eel in this very pond!\" The king's officers couldn't believe their ears. Drown an eel whose home is in the water? These men were sillier than the first man they met!\nBefore long, they reached the center of the village, where they were in for another surprise. There they found the rest of the townspeople building a towering stone wall. When the soldiers inquired what was going on, one of the villagers replied, \"Every spring a cuckoo comes to live in our village. It always brings warm weather. When it leaves, the cold weather returns. Last year we decided that if we could get the cuckoo to stay here all year, we would always have warm weather. We built this stone wall, but it obviously wasn't high enough because the bird flew away. This year we're determined to build it so high that the cuckoo can't escape.\"\nThe king's officers had heard enough. They couldn't bring themselves to punish such stupid people. They returned to King John and told him all about the fools of Gotham. Whether it's fair or not, the people of Gotham have been known as fools ever since.\nWhat do you think? Were the villagers of Gotham wise or foolish?", "id": "high9922.txt"}
