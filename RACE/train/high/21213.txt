It found that, regardless of how much exercise they did or their total sitting time, those who took more breaks from sitting had lower risk of thick waists and lower levels of blood lipids .\n\"Higher levels of blood lipids have been linked to a heightened risk of heart disease,\" principal researcher Genevieve Healy of the University of Queensland said. \"What the study shows is that there are benefits in just getting up regularly and interrupting your sitting time.\"\nResearchers behind the Stand Up Australia project have written to the Rudd Government requesting $3.5 million for a two-year study into the impact how long sitting offects health and productivity of workers. The study would also develop and test strategies for reducing sitting time on the job.\nThe latest study builds on work that is shifting the health promotion focus from purposeful exercise, such as running, to lower intensity activities throughout the day.\nThe Australian research has been backed up by US studies.\n\"To hold a body that weighs 77 kilograms upright takes a fair amount of energy from muscles,\" said Professor Marc Hamilton from the University of Missouri. \"There is a large amount of energy associated with standing every day that cannot easily be replaced by 30 to 60 minutes in the gym.\"", "id": "high21213.txt"}
