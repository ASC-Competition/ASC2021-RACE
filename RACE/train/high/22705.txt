While coffee contains caffeine, which may temporarily increase heart rate and blood pressure in some people, coffee also contains hundreds of unique compounds that may do good to health. Further confusing much of the research into coffee is the fact that many coffee drinkers are also smokers, and it has been difficult to untangle the   health effects of coffee and cigarettes.\nTo learn more, researchers from the National Institutes of Health analyzed diet and health information collected from questionnaires filled out by 229,119 men and 173,141 women, who were members of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) between 1995 and 1996. They were followed until 2008, by which point 52,000 had died.\nAs expected, the researchers found that the regular coffee drinkers in the group were also more likely to be smokers. They are more red meat and fewer fruits and vegetables, exercised less and drank more alcohol -- all behaviors associated with poor health.\nBut once the researchers were able to separate the risks, the data showed that the more coffee a person consumed, the less likely he or she was to die from a number of health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, infections and even injuries and accidents.", "id": "high22705.txt"}
