Let's take the boat out tomorrow morning,just you and me. Maybe we can catch some crabs for dinner,and we can talk more.\"\nEarly next morning we set off along the coast. We didn't talk much,but enjoyed the sound of the seagulls and the sight of the coastline and the sea beyond.\nThere was no surf on the coastal waters at that time.\"Let's see if we get lucky,\"he said,picked up a mesh basket with a rope attached and threw it into the sea. We waited a while,then my father stood up and said,\"Give me a hand with this,\"and we pulled up the crab cage onto the deck.\nThe cage was filled with dozens of soft shell crabs.\"Why don't they try to escape?\"\n\"just watch them for a moment. Look at that one,there!He's trying to climb out,but every time the other crabs pull him back in,\"said my father.\nAfter several times,not only did the crab give up its struggle to escape,but it actually began to help stop other crabs trying to escape.He'd finally chosen an easy way of life.\nSuddenly I understood why my father had suggested catching crabs that morning. He looked at me.\n\"Don't get pulled back by the others,\"he said.\"Spend some time figuring out who you are and what you want in life.Think about what's really important to you,what really interests you,what skills you have.If you can't answer these questions now,then take some time to find out. Because if you don't,you'll never be happy.\"\nMy father started the motor and we set off back home.", "id": "high19090.txt"}
