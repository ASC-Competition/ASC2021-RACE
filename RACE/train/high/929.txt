Making decisions on your own is hard enough, but when other people get involved and try to pressure you one way or another it can be even harder. People who are your age, like your classmates, are called peers. When they try to influence how you act, to get you to do something, it's called peer pressure.\nPeers can have a positive influence on each other. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in the solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book, and now everyone's reading it. These are examples of how peers positively influence each other.\nSometimes peers influence each other in negative ways. For example, a few kids in school might try to get you to cut class with them; your soccer friend might try to convince you to be mean to another player and never pass him the ball.\nIt is tough to be the only one who says \"no\" to peer pressure, but you can do it. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do.\nYou've probably had a parent or teacher advising you to \"choose your friends wisely.\" Peer pressure is a big reason why they say this. If you choose friends who don't cut class, smoke cigarettes, or lie to their parents, then you probably won't do these things either, even if other kids do.\nIf you continue to face peer pressure and you're finding it difficult to handle, talk to someone you trust. Don't feel guilty if you've made a mistake or two.", "id": "high929.txt"}
