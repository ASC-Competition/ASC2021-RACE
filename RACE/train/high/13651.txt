Swift's family ran a farm. \"I had her sitting on a small horse when she was nine months old,\" said Swift's mother. \"If my dream had gone well, she'd be in a horse show right now.\" The only obvious forerunner   of Swift's musical talent was her grandmother, an opera singer.\nThat talent showed itself early: when the family went to see a Disney musical film, Swift would come out of the theater singing all the songs correctly. At the age of 11, she sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at a Philadelphia 76ers game. The experiences during her pre-teen years encouraged the creativity to go with Swift's talent. As a child, she attended the academically competitive Wyndcroft School in Pottstown, but then switched to public schools in Wyomissing. Although it was her hometown, she didn't know any of her classmates, and she was terrified. Swift began to understand the storytelling feature of country songs, and put her feelings into songs of her own.\nOne of her future hits, \"The Outside\", was written when she was only 12. \"I wrote that about the scariest feeling I've ever felt: going to school, looking at those faces, and not knowing who you're gonna talk to that day,\" she said. \"In the music, I could never feel the kind of rejection   that I felt in middle school.\" Swift's parents quickly realized that they had someone special on their hands. They sold their farm when she was 13 and moved the family to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[:Z+xx+k.Com]\nSwift had the ability, above all, to put feelings into words with accuracy   far beyond her years. In \"Our Song\" she wrote, \"Our song is the slamming screen door, going out late, tapping on your window.\" In the summer of 2006, \"Tim McGraw\" came out, and almost from the beginning the 16-year-old Taylor Swift was a star.", "id": "high13651.txt"}
