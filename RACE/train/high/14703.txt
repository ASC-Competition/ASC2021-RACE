Amy Chua is a law professor at America's Yale University and her recent book on the subject is making waves. She's been called \"dangerous\",\"outrageous\",even a \"monster\" for her descriptions of how she brought up her two daughters.\nHer bookBattle Hymn of the Tiger Motherdescribes fighting with a daughter for hours at the piano to ensure the child gets a piece of music right. She rejected birthday cards made for her by her girls because she didn't think they had made enough effort. She compared one child negatively with the other, threatening to burn their toys. Her rules include: schoolwork always comes first; an A-minus is a bad grade; children must be two years ahead of their classmates in math, and playing the violin or the piano is a must. Ms. Chua considers the Chinese hard work ethic as a way of creating happy, successful children--at least in her case. Although she's had a large amount of _ for her theories, one thing can't be ignored--the success of Chinese children in the education system.\nIn Britain, shocking research shows that Chinese girls, for example, are outperforming all other foreign groups at GCSE--79 percent getting 5 A--C Grades, compared with 58 percent of white British girls. So what is it about Chinese parenting that's leading to high achievers? And how do Amy Chua's theories play into that success?\nShe told me that if her daughter came back from school with 96/100 in a test, Chua would ask her what happened to the other 4 points. It's about always knowing \"you can do better\",she told me. Interestingly, in China, the birthplace of the tiger mother, people are moving away from traditional Chinese parenting. They are following more western parenting styles.", "id": "high14703.txt"}
