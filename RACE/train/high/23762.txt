When Roy, the manager, had to leave for a few days, he put Rogers in charge. \"What if the workers refuse to follow my orders?\" Rogers asked. He thought of Tony, a worker who was always giving the other men a hard time. \"Fire them,\" Roy said. Then, as if reading Rogers' mind, he added, \"I suppose you want to fire Tony if you get the chance. I'd feel bad about that. Tony is the most reliable worker I've ever had. I know he complains a lot, but he comes first and leaves last. There has not been an accident on the hill where he works for eight years.\" \nRogers took over the manager's job the next day. He went to Tony and spoke to him, \"Tony, did you know that I'm in charge today?\" Tony didn't show any respect or interest. \"I was going to fire you because you once gave me a hard time, but I want you to know I'm not,\" he told Tony, adding what Roy had said. When Rogers finished, tears streamed down Tony's face. That day Tony worked harder than ever before --and he smiled for the first time! Rogers went back to school after that summer. \nTwelve years later he met Tony again. He was in charge of one of the largest logging companies in the West. Rogers asked him how he managed to become so successful. Tony replied, \"If it were not for that time you spoke to me back in Idaho, I would not be myself today. That one minute changed my whole life.\" \nHave you got one minute to appreciate someone? It can make a difference for a lifetime.", "id": "high23762.txt"}
