It left me wondering what was going to happen to us now. But it reassured me some when my mother told me she was relieved to be leaving since her boss wasn't the nicest person to be around.\nI got off the college shuttle bus and started walking. That's when I heard piano music and singing rising above the noise of the people and the traffic. I walked a little slower so I could find out where it was coming from. Through the crowd I saw a young lady sitting at a piano with a carriage next to her.\nShe was singing songs about love, keeping on trying, and not underestimating the power within yourself. The way she was singing comforted me a bit. I stood there watching her play for about fifteen minutes, thinking that it must take courage to perform on your own in the middle of a crowded New York ferry terminal.\nSo I stood there listening.\nShe must have felt my presence because she would occasionally look in my direction. By now I was telling myself that if she could perform in front of hundreds of people she didn't know then I could at least tell her how good she sounded. I walked over and put some money in her carriage and she said, \"Thank you.\" Instead of continuing my way home, I said to her, \"I have been going through a rough time lately, but you've made me hopeful again.\"\n\"I'm happy that I could help,\" she replied. \"Why are you so sad?\"\n\"Well, my mum told me she had got fired from her job, and that made me sad. I'm not so sure what to do ...\"\n\"You see, here's the problem,\" she explained. \"The way you were walking, your head was down. Don't look defeated, because opportunity comes in different ways and if your head is down you might never see it. You should smile more ... lift your head up.\"\nI smiled faintly, amazed by how she was encouraging me. So, I asked her, \"Why are you playing the piano in the middle of a crowded place? I've seen you do this more than once.\"\nShe explained to me that she sees a lot of negative people in the world and she tries to alleviate the pain and bring more positivity by sharing motivational music. She told me that when she wasn't making music she studied psychology. So, that was how she knew some of the things she was telling me.\nI smiled a little wider because I knew that she was doing a good thing. So, after that we parted, my heart touched and lightened by a musical soul!", "id": "high15691.txt"}
