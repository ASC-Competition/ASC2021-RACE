Call loud: \"I'm ready! Come and find me!\"\nThe snacks in the tool shed   smell like the seaside.\nThey'll never find you in the salty dark,\nBut be careful that your feet aren't sticking out.\nWisher not to risk another shout.\nThe floor is cold. They'll probably be searching\nThe bushes near the swing. Whatever happens,\nYou mustn't sneeze when they come prowling   in.\nAnd here they are, whispering at the door;\nYou've never heard them so hushed   before,\nDon't breathe. Don't move. Stay dumb. Hide in your blindness. \nThey're moving closer, someone stumbles, mutters;\nTheir words and laughter scuffle, and they're gone.\nBut don't come out just yet; they'll try the lane\nAnd then the greenhouse and back here again.\nThey must be thinking that you've very clever,\nGetting more puzzled as they went away.\nYou legs are stiff, the cold bites through your coat;\nThe dark damp smell of sand moves in your throat.\nIt's time to let them know that you're the winner.\nPush off the snacks.
