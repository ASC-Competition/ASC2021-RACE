The pain was terrible, but there was no one home to give me any sympathy. I walked around the house, finally arriving at the telephone! Quickly, I called \"Information Please\" and told her what happened.  She told me to open the icebox and hold a little piece of ice to my finger.\nAfter that, I called \"Information Please\" for everything. When my pet bird died, I told \"Information Please\" the sad story. She tried to comfort me, she said quietly, \"Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in.\" Somehow I felt better. Another day I was on the telephone, \"How do you spell 'grateful'? \". All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was 9, we moved to Boston.\nA few years later, on my way to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes. Without thinking, I dialed my hometown operator and said, \"Information, please.\"\nSurprisingly, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well, \"Information.\" I hadn't planned on this but I heard myself saying, \"Could you please tell me how to spell 'grateful'?\"\nThere was a long pause. Then came the soft-spoken answer, \"I guess your finger must have healed by now.\"   I laughed. \"So it's really still you,\" I said, \"I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time.\"  I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and asked if I could call her again. \"Please do,\" she said, \"Just ask for Sally.\"\nThree months later I was back in Seattle. A different voice answered me. I was told that Sally passed away five weeks before.\nBefore I could hang up she told me that Sally left a message for me--\"Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in. He'll know what I mean.\"  I thanked her and hung up. I knew what Sally meant.\nNever underestimate the impression you may make on others. Whose life have you touched today?", "id": "high15186.txt"}
