And the frontline weapon in their campaign is the water meter  . They want us all to have one and one company is seeking powers to make this compulsory.\nThe Government is anxious for us to use less water, too. Elliot Morley, the Environment Minister, says he is impressed by the savings when a meter is installed. In most homes, consumption drops by 20 percent.\nHe also thinks consumers get a good deal from meters. He said, \"Most people would find that they would either be exactly the same or better off with water meters and it is a fairer way of paying for water.\"\nAt present, only 25% of households have meters and most of those are in East Anglia. They are installed by water companies, and households then have about PS43 added to each bill to cover the cost of installing and reading the meter.\nBarrie Clarke, a spokesman for Water UK, said, \"We want everyone to be more water wise--to think about the amount of water they use. But with our climate change and different weather patterns, over time it will make economic and environmental sense to think how we use water. This may mean meters.\"\nMr. Clarke believes the easiest way to save water is to use less in the garden. In one hour, a sprinkler uses the same amount of water as the average family of four uses in a day--about 632 liters. He said that gardeners should water in the evening so that it dose not _ in the heat of the day and that every household should have a water butt to collect rainwater for use in the garden.", "id": "high3361.txt"}
