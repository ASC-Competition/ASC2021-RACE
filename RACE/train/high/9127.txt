Let me explain.\nMaybe you have heard the Great Barrier Reef, stretching some 1,800 miles from New Guinea to Australia.Tour guides regularly take visitors to view the reef.\nOn one tour, a traveler asked the guide an interesting question.\"I notice that the lagoon  side of the reef looks pale and lifeless, while the ocean side is vibrant and colorful,\" the traveler observed.Why is this?\nThe guide gave an interesting answer, \"The coral around the lagoon side is in still water, with no challenge for its survival.It dies early.The coral on the ocean side is constantly being tested by wind, waves and storms.It has to fight for its survival every day.As it is challenged and tested, it changes and adapts.It grows healthy.It grows strong.And it reproduces.\"\nThen he added, \"That's the way it is with every living organism.\"\nThat's how it is with people.Challenged and tested, we come alive! Like coral pounded by the sea, we grow.Physical demands can cause us to grow stronger.Mental and emotional stress can produce tough-mindedness and resiliency.Spiritual testing can produce strength of character and faithfulness.So, you have problems? No problem! Just tell yourself, \"There I grow again!\"\nRemember: A smooth sea never made a skilled mariner.", "id": "high9127.txt"}
