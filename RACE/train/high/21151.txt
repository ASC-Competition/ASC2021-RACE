Some worry that anger over the \nforthcoming Los Angeles Timesarticle will make people oppose so-called \"value added\" analysis of\nteacher performance, which is the method the Times uses.\n\"This incident with the L.A. Times is where the advocates  for value-added are getting a bit \nahead of themselves,\" says Douglas Harris, an education professor. \" _ \nthe gun on this kind of thing.\"\n\"Value-added data\" is the latest trend in teacher responsibility: the idea that a student's gain from the\nprevious year's test -- as opposed to his or her overall performance -- can be measured and tied to the \nlatest teacher.\n\"There are too many variables  in the testing process,\" says A.J. Duffy. But he says he opposes \nusing value-added data in evaluations at all, although he acknowledges it could be a useful tool to give \nteachers feedback. \"I believe in a system that emphasizes the whole student, not just standardized tests,\" \nhe says.\nProponents  of value-added say that's a valid criticism, agreeing that no one should expect\nthat student gains on a standardized test could capture the creativity or broader enrichment that goes on in \nmany teachers' classrooms. The District of Columbia which attracted argument for its decision to fire \nteachers based in part on value-added data, uses that data for 50 percent of the evaluation, relying on \nother measures such as classroom observation for the rest. \"No one is suggesting using  _ as a single\nmeasure of performance,\" says Paige Kowalski.\nBarnett Berry, a professor, is even more critical of it. Value-added data can be useful, he and others \nsay, but it's important to acknowledge its limitations. It doesn't take into account, for instance, constant \nstudent absence and learning gains due to summer school, after-school programs, or supplemental \nteachers, such as reading specialists.", "id": "high21151.txt"}
