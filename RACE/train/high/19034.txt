But luckily, they were set free last Tuesday morning, unharmed by the people who had taken them hostages.\nAfter hard work by Chinese diplomats  in the region, the Iraqi kidnappers  agreed to hand them over to a local religious group. \"The friendly relations between the Chinese and Iraqi people have played a key role in the release  of the hostages,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan. China refused to join the US-led coalition  in the Iraqi war.\nSince April 4, over 60 hostages from 12 countries, including America, Italy and Japan, have been taken in Iraq. Some have been released, others were killed.\nThe Iraqi resistance groups have started taking foreigners hostages in an attempt to force the US-led troops out of their country. As a result, many foreigners have left, fearing the situation will get worse. Some nations are also considering removing their troops from Iraq. Thailand has ordered its forces not to leave their camp and may bring them home before September as originally planned. New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark is considering similar action.\nBut Dan Senor, spokesman for the US-led coalition in Baghdad, said that it would not negotiate  with \"terrorists  or kidnappers\" to get hostages released.", "id": "high19034.txt"}
