Now mid-aged Americans may not keep in touch with old people until they are old themselves.That's because we group people by age. We put our three-year-olds together in day-care center, our 13-year-olds in school and sports activities, and our 80-year-olds in senior-citizen homes. Why?\nWe live away from the old for many reasons: young people sometimes avoid the old to get rid of fears for aging and dying. It is much harder to watch .someone we love disappear before our eyes. Sometimes it's so hard that we stay away from the people who need us most.\nFortunately, .some of us have found our way to the old. And we have discovered that they often save the young.\nA reporter moved her family onto a block filled with old people. At first her children were disappointed. But the reporter baked banana bread for the neighbours and had her children deliver it and visit. Soon the children had many new friends, with whom they shared food, stories and projects. \"My children have never been less lonely,\" the reporter said.\nThe young, in turn, save the old. Once I was in a rest home when a visitor showed up with a baby. She was immediately surrounded. People who hadn't gotten out of bed in a week suddenly were ringing for a wheelchair. Even those who had seemed asleep wake up to watch the child. Babies have an astonishing power to comfort and cure.\nGrandparents are a special case. They give grandchildren a feeling of security and continuity. As my husband put it, \"my grandparents gave me a deep sense that things would turn out right in the end.\"\nGrandchildren speak of attention they don't get from worried parents. \"My parents were always telling me to hurry up, and my grandparents told me to slow down,\" one friend said. A teacher told me she can tell which pupils have relationships with grandparents: they are quieter, calmer, more trusting.", "id": "high2973.txt"}
