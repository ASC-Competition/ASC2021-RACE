An outstanding Opening Ceremony, splendid athletic performances in perfect stadiums, the best-ever Paralympic Villages, amazing high definition   television coverage, a never ending and self-generating   supply of passion and emotion, superb organization, wonderful volunteers, millions of new Paralympic sports lovers both here in China and around the world. These are the greatest Paralympic Games ever.\n--Philip Craven, president of the International Paralympic Committee\nIt was another spectacular show. Perhaps it's not quite as sublimely  beautiful as the opening, but a fitting end to what has been a memorable 12 days in the Chinese capital.\nThe Paralympics were inspiring.

And the next step will be for the abilities of disabled people on the Paralympics to be translated into a realization of their abilities to study, work and go about daily life in a barrier-free society.\n-- Eric Roeder, China Daily", "id": "high24176.txt"}
