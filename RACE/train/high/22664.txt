The agreement called upon UN members to help the newly developing countries achieve a minimum rate of growth of 5% by the end of the decade. It also emphasized the need for industrial development and encouraged cooperation with respect to regional-development programs.\nIn the past the organs and agencies of the UN in the economic field have concentrated largely on economic development. Increased attention was directed towards the need for balance and integration in economic and social development. It was emphasized at various UN meetings that particular attention must be given in the new nations to such problems as urbanization, housing, community development, and child welfare.\nThe Assembly has also offered a $100,000,000 world food program designed to use surplus   food to encourage the development of needy countries. The program would improve upon the present unsatisfactory method of disposing of surplus food supplies and would enable the poorer nations to use more of their resources for development purposes.\nMany of the UN specialized agencies increased their budgets. This means that such agencies as the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, the World Health Organization, and the International Labor Organization will be pushing ahead at an increasing rate to deal with problems in their respective fields.\nThe Assembly again set $150,000,000 as the target figure for the work of the UN Technical Assistance Program and the Special Fund. If funds are available, technical assistance will move ahead at a faster speed.", "id": "high22664.txt"}
