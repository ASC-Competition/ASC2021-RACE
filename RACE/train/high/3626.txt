Stop shopping at the store. Flowers and other things in stores are too common to mention. You can choose a special gift for Mother's Day! Just try staying close to home--and heart --write a Mother's Day poem for her.\nUse your head. Think of special moments when you were a child, times you've shared with your mom, things she did for you, and why you love her. Write down how those moments influenced you. Write down everything you can think of. This is your inspiration for the poem.\nLook at what you wrote and pick out those things that are connected . See if any words rhyme . It's fine to write a free poem(one without rhymes), but many people find poems with rhymes are easier to work with, easier to read and quite catchy . If no words rhyme but you want your poem to, try to find connecting words that can help connect memories.\nOnce you have a few sentences, put them in a good order. For example, you could start with a childhood memory and end with something you remember from last month.\nAdd a title that shows the feeling of the poem. Even something as simple as \"For Mom\" can work, although something more personal might be better.\nWrite it in pen if you have beautiful handwriting. Read the poem over breakfast on Mother's Day, and then hand it to your mom. Let's wait and see the smile and tears of happiness on her face.", "id": "high3626.txt"}
