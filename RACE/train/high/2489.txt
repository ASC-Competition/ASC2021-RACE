We were happy because it was a sunny day. We were expecting an enjoyable two-day holiday. On the way, we kept singing and making jokes.\nHowever, in the afternoon, when we finished our picnic at one o'clock, it was dark and windy. Soon, there was a shower. Unluckily, none of us brought an umbrella. We ran about but we could find no place to hide.\nTwenty minutes passed and it was still raining, There were hours to go before we reached the campsite  . It was even worse that our small compass   showed that we went to the wrong way. We had lost our way!\nWe had to make a quick decision as it was raining heavily. Chris said we could set up a tent to hide in, so Mary and Tom helped to set up the tent. Chris and I tried to make a fire to keep us warm. But we were unable to light the fire, as everything was wet. We dried ourselves, chatted and waited inside the tent. At about five o'clock, it stopped raining. We decided to give up the camping trip because all of us had been very tired.\nThis camping trip may not be very successful but we know each other better. And the most important thing I've learned from this trip is the importance of team spirit.", "id": "high2489.txt"}
