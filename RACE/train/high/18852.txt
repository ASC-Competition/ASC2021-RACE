The first name comes from the verb to \"cop\", meaning to \"take\" or \"capture\", and the second comes from the first name of Sir Robert Peel, the nineteenth-century politician, who was the founder of the police force as we know it today. An early nickname for the policeman was \"peeler\", but this one has died out.\nWhatever we may call them, the general opinion about the police seems to be a good one except, of course, among the criminal part of the community where the police are given more bad nicknames which came from America, such as \"fuzz\" or \"pig\". Visitors to prefix = st1 /Englandseem, nearly always, to be very impressed by the English police.

A music-hall song of some years ago was called, \"If You Want To Know The Time, Ask A Policeman\". Nowadays, most people own watches but they still seem to find plenty of other questions to ask the policemen. In London, the policemen spend so much of their time directing visitors about the city that one wonders how they ever find time to do anything else!\nTwo things are noticeable to the stranger, when he sees an English policeman for the first time. The first is that he does not carry a gun and the second is that he wears a very special type of helmet . His helmet, together with his height, enables an English policeman to be seen from a long distance, a fact that is not without its usefulness. From time to time it is suggested that the policeman should be given a gun and that his helmet should be taken from him, but both these suggestions are not accepted by the majority of the public and the police themselves.", "id": "high18852.txt"}
