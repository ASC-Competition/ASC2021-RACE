She hesitated, uncertain how to classify herself.\n\"What I mean is,\" explained the recorder, \"do you have a job, or are you just a ...\"\n\"Of course I have a job,\" said Emily. \"I'm a mother.\"\n\"We don't list 'mother' as an occupation... 'housewife' covers it,\" said the recorder.\nOne day I found myself in the same situation. The clerk was obviously a career woman, confident and possessed of a high sounding title. \"What is your occupation?\" she asked.\nThe words simply popped out. \"I'm a Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human Relations.\"\nThe clerk paused, ballpoint pen frozen in midair.\nI repeated the title slowly, then I stared with wonder as my statement was written in bold, black ink on the official questionnaire.\n\"Might I ask,\" said the clerk with new interest, \"Just what you do in this field?\"\nCoolly, without any trace of panic in my voice, I heard myself reply, \"I have a continuing program of research (what mother doesn't), in the lab and in the field (normally I would have said indoors and out). Of course, the job is one of the most demanding in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?), and I often work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it). But the job is more challenging than most careers and rewards are more of a satisfaction rather than just money.\"\nThere was an increasing note of respect in the clerk's voice as she completed the form, stood up, and showed me out.\nAs I drove into our driveway, buoyed up   by my glamorous new career, I was greeted by my lab assistants---ages 13, 7, and 3.\nUpstairs I could hear our new experimental model (a 6 month old baby), in the child-development program, testing out a new vocal pattern.\nI felt proud! I had gone on the official records as someone more distinguished and indispensable   to mankind than \"just another mother.\"\nMotherhood...What a glorious career! Especially when there's a title on the door.", "id": "high1731.txt"}
