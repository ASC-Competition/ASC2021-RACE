Many people begin their days by reading the paper. In this way they learn what is going on in the world. Sometimes,however,they don't have the time to read the news carefully and must be satisfied with a quick look at the front page,at other times they may be in such a hurry that they have time only to _ at the headlines. There are newspapers to satisfy every reader. In big cities there are many types with several different editions every day. In small towns there are few newspapers and perhaps only one edition each day. In some areas the paper is printed weekly.\nMost papers have several editions,especially on Sundays when the editions are larger than usual.
