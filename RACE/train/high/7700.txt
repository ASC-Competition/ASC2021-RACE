The story may or may not be true. But inflation was up so fast that by the end of 1923, they were 50 billion percent higher-- a rise of almost 2500% a month.\nThere was so much paper money, and it had so little value that people carried bags full of money around to pay for things.

But when she was looking, a thief robbed her. He didn't take her money; however, he threw it away and took the basket instead.\nAt first workers demanded to be paid every day. But as the situation became worse, they had to be paid twice a day. but they had to run out and spend the money at once, or it would lose its value.
