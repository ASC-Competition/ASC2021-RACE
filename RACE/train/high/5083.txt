Zulu is the most widely spoken home language, spoken by over 3.1 million pupils. However, less than a third of them choose to be taught in Zulu. The same thing is true of Pedi-speaking pupils, only a third of such pupils choosing to be taught in their home language.

In April 2011, the leaders of higher education and training said that they would take some steps to improve the university teaching and prevent the continuing _ of African languages. They suggested that in future every South African university student could be required to learn at least one African language in order to complete their studies at school.", "id": "high5083.txt"}
