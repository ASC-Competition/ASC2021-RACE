The health advantages of standing instead of sitting for eight hours a day are clear, so when the company Ergotron invited me to review their WorkFit C-Mod Dual Desk, I jumped out of my chair---really.\nAfter several hours putting the desk together, I finally got to try it out. The standing desk had a desktop that I could use for writing.\nAt first I absolutely loved it. Standing during the day instead of sitting was fantastic. Although I felt more tired after all that standing during the day, I knew the health benefits were worth the slight discomfort. However, after the initial novelty  of the desk wore off, I realized that I could not use it in the long term.\nIt was just not practical. While using the desk for a month , I could definitely foresee problems arising from using it full time.\nI enjoy having a lot of things on my desk. The standing desk just did not have enough room for all of my things.\nI can easily foresee awkward situations when I put that desk in an office space. When someone comes into your office, does your guest have to stand as well? If you office is big enough, maybe you have room for two chairs for you and a visitor, which is great. Yet for the ordinary worker in a small office, the standing desk creates a very awkward situation.\nAdditionally, the amount of money I would have to spend to replace my current workspace with a standing desk was another issue. The desks I have looked at were highly expensive.\nYes, spending the day standing can offset  many of the negative effects of too much sitting, but we humans are designed for movement. Through activity changes like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, you can easily increase the time you spend on your feet. Best of all, those options are completely free.", "id": "high3989.txt"}
