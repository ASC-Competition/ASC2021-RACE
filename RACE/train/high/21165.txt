Rolling down the windows to let in fresh air, she settled back to enjoy her lunch. Suddenly she noticed a big  _ man running through the parking lot. Before she came to realize what would happen, the man was there, shouting through her window, \"Get out!\"\n Neilson refused.\nPulling open her door, the man seized her by the neck and hair, and threw her out of the car onto the ground. She screamed, grabbing her purse and the keys.\nTwo reporters of the local newspaper, Robert Bruce and Jeff Jackson, just outside their office building on a break, heard the screams and began running .\nWhen they reached Neilson's car, the attacker had jumped into the driver's seat and was madly searching for the keys. Bruce opened the door, and he and Jackson dragged the man out. The attacker fought back. But even in his cornered panic, he was no match for the two athletic men.\nReggie Miller, a worker of the local newspaper, heard the screams, too. He rushed back to the office to phone the police, and then ran back with some plastic ropes ---- used to tie up newspapers.\nWith his arms tied tight behind him, the prisoner looked up and said coldly, \"I hope you guys feel good about yourselves---- you just caught one of the most wanted men.\" They ignored him and waited for the police. Later, Bruce and Jackson were shocked to learn the man was the professional carjacker  and suspected murderer, whose picture---- but with a full head of hair---- had been recently printed in their own newspaper.                                                                                                                               \nNeilson considers herself lucky though she suffered injuries. She believes the story might have had a different ending if those good people had not come to her aid. \"Unfortunately,\" she said, \"many people would never have done what they did, and that is the real truth.\"", "id": "high21165.txt"}
