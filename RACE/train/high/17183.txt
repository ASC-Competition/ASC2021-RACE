In the past , many people spent their entire lives in the communities in which they were born and raised .Many more people continued to live with their parents ,brothers and sisters after they were married and had children of their own . By remaining in familiar communities with  s nearby, families had enough opportunities for friendly contact and for support in time of trouble.\nRecent studies suggest that family arrangements in Western societies have not changed as much in the last few centuries as is generally believed .Yet most sociologists agree that in modern societies ,there are fewer opportunities for friendship and support from  s outside the immediate family .Parents and children often live apart from other  s ,and seldom visit them .Also ,the family moves when a parent accepts a job in another place or when it decides to live in a better neighborhood. Together , loneliness and mobility force immediate family members to depend heavily on one another for affection and companionship.\nBecause the family is one of the few ongoing sources of affection and companionship in modern societies, a high percentage of people continue to marry ,even though it is possible for a single man and woman to live together without marrying. On the other hand, because affection and companionship have become so important, families are more likely to break up if the husband's or wife's emotional needs are not met  within the family circle--even if all other family functions are being satisfactorily performed ,and in this sense ,affection and companionship have become the touchstone of the modern family.", "id": "high17183.txt"}
