The couple met during the 1930s when Antonio served as a young officer.\nThe case appears to set a new record, at least for the age of the oldest figures - the previous oldest couple to divorce were Bertie and Jessie Wood, both aged 98, from the UK.\nThat pair ended their 36 - year marriage in 2009 when they were both two years away from their l00th birthdays.They got married in Elstree, Hertfordshire, in 1972, having both ended previous marriages, before moving to Falmouth, Cornwall four years later.", "id": "high3096.txt"}
