I was looking forward to a quiet view   of some great paintings of excellent artists.\nA young couple looking at the paintings in front of me were talking non-stop. I watched them a moment and decided she was doing all the talking. In fact, I was surprised at this man for putting up with her everlasting speech. Bored by their noise, I moved on.\nI met them several times as I moved through those rooms of art. Each time I heard her voice, I moved away at once. \nI was standing at the museum gift shop buying some cards when the couple walked to the exit  .\n\"He's a brave man,\" said the shop assistant. \"Most of us would give up if we were blinded at such a young age. But he and his wife come in whenever there's a new art show.\"\nIt explained the non-stop talk! A sudden sense of shame came to my heart for what I was thinking just now. \"But what does he get out of the art?\" I asked.\n\"His wife describes each painting so he can see it in his head.\"\nAt that moment I realized what is patience, courage and love. I saw the patience of a young wife describing paintings to a person who can't see and courage of a husband who would not allow blindness change his love towards art. And I felt the love shared by the two as I watched them walking away holding each other's hands.", "id": "high16778.txt"}
