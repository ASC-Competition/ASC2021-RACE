She was so happy when she entered the British embassy . She thought it was the greatest happiness in her life as many graduates wanted to get that job while she was one of the few people who got it!\n              But when she started her new job, she realized that it was just a job of answering calls and recording staff members' starting and quitting times. It was unappreciated and was supposed to have no future. However, she didn't feel sad about it. She learnt how to love the job. And she loved it when she was working. The names and phone numbers of the staff members were written down on the notebook so that she could remember them. When the phone calls came in, she picked it up as soon as possible. When someone asked her about who was not in the office, she would answer them the right name and the time when they left. Nobody could do that except her.\n              Her wonderful performance not only received the compliments from the embassy's staff, but also the employees from the local government. And a leader of a famous company in Britain was also impressed by it and invited her to work for him. After that she became a personal translator of an important leader from Britain and appreciated by the foreigners.\n              We cannot choose our destiny , but we can choose the attitude with which we face our life. Maybe the attitude could change our destiny. If we cry to life, life will be gray. If we smile to life, life will smile to us, too.", "id": "high23781.txt"}
