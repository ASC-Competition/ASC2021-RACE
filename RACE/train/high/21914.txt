Dean  at the university, Jeffrey Brenzel, said the admission  for Kenny, Martina, Ray and Carol, all 18-year-old students at Danbury High School in Connecticut , was probably the  first for the university. \"The living memory in the office here shows that we've just had twins, never quadruplets,\" he told the reporters. \"They are all interesting and quite smart in their own way. They are extremely lively kids, very attractive, but clearly four different people. They are all in the top 10 percent of the class.\"\n    The quadruplets explained to The New York Times how they nervously logged on one by one to the Yale website to discover their fates, First was Ray, who described how the screen suddenly turned Yale blue and displayed the university's bulldog mascot  with the message \"welcome to the Class of 2014\". \"We just kept logging on and screaming, logging on and screaming,' Martina, last to find out, said in an interview with the local television station WINH-TV. Until May 1 they have to decide whether to accept Yale's offers and part of the decision will come down to money, they told the Times.\n Their father Steven works as a case manager with the Connecticut mental health department and their mother, Caroline, who originally came from Nigeria, is studying for her master's degree in social work, according to the Times.\n     Ranked as one of the top three universities in the US after Harvard and Princeton, Yale's school fees each year can be as high as 36,500 dollars, which would land the Crouch family with a very heavy load by the time they graduate in 2014.", "id": "high21914.txt"}
