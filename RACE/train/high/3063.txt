I hope that you and your child are settled and comfortable in the arrangement of the new school year. I would like to take this opportunity to give you news about the art project that the eighth grade students and I will be working on during this unit.\nMy name is Molly Atkinson and I am a new middle school teacher here at MSAE in Kauai. I feel that it is important for you to know that my approach to classroom management is inspired by Maharishi's Principle of Ideal Teaching. I believe that it is the most positive method for guiding our students' education. I also believe that by keeping the lessons interesting, the classroom will be a creative environment for the students to explore the artistic process. My experience with the class this week makes me believe that the students and I will have a fruitful and caring experience in our time together.\nThe students' first project is a three-part work that begins with the creation of a collage  . A pencil drawing of the collage will follow. The third part of the project will be a geometrical three-dimensional   drawing of the collage. The students have jumped right into the project with enthusiasm   and focus. I can tell that we are going to have a very productive unit.\nOn October 30th, the students will have a showing of their work for you. I look forward to meeting all of you that day. If you would like to get hold of me before _ I will be here after school until 4:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays and can be available on other afternoons by appointment  . I may also be reached at my e-mail address: matkinson@kdsi.net. I am very happy to be here and look forward to working with the eighth grade students.\nSincerely,\nMolly Atkinson", "id": "high3063.txt"}
