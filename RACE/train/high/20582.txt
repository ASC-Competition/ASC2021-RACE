The planes flew east over the coast... and disappeared. The group was Flight 19, on a run between Florida and Bahamas. Tailor was the group leader. At about 3:40, Tailor reported that his compasses  were not reading properly. The other planes followed their leaders aimlessly, first east, then west, then northeast over the ocean, as Tailor tried to make sure of the direction by radio. Then, suddenly Tailor was heard to give orders to dive...\n    Quickly, two giant Martin seaplanes were sent up to search for Flight 19. Several hours later, the wind became strong and visibility   dropped. A return to base was ordered. But only one of the Martin seaplanes landed. Four days later, the Navy and Coast Guard  _ a 100,000 square--mile area with more than 100 planes and ships. No sign was ever shown of the missing planes.\n    Today, people have noted the disappearance of many ships and planes in the southwest part of the North Atlantic and began to call this area the Bermuda Triangle.\n    The points of the triangle are Bermuda, Puerto Rico and a particular place in the Gulf of Mexico, west of Florida. It is a two--faced water world of tiny islands, bright beaches and beautiful waters. Yet thick fogs, powerful currents  and sudden storms are hidden behind this smiling surface.", "id": "high20582.txt"}
