Group 1 carcinogens definitely cause cancer in humans. Group 2A is probably carcinogenic to humans, Group 2B is possibly carcinogenic, the carcinogenicity of Group 3 in humans is unclassifiable, and Group 4 is probably not carcinogenic to humans. Only a little more than 100 are classified as Group 1 cancer-causing substances, including ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke.\n\"Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,\" the lARC's Dana Loomis said in a statement. \"The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.\"\nIn 2010, lung cancer resulting from air pollution killed 223,000 people worldwide, and there was also convincing evidence that it increases the risk of bladder   cancer, according to the IARC.\nAir pollution is already known to raise risks for a wide range of illnesses, including respiratory and heart diseases.\nAir pollution is global, although the levels of it vary over space and time.\nLoomis said people in Asia, eastern North America, some places in Central America and Mexico, as well as North Africa have relatively high exposure. Developing countries with large populations and booming manufacturing sectors, such as China, are particularly at risk.\nMany cities in China, such as Beijing, frequently see smog. This week, Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang province, became the first Chinese city to officially suspend classes due to serious smog\nMany developed countries face similar problems, although to a lesser degree than most developing nations. In Europe, levels of many pollutants have fallen. But between 91 and 96 percent of Europeans living in cities are exposed to levels of PM2.5--tiny particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers--that are higher than the WHO safety limits, says a report published by the European Environment Agency on Oct 15.\nAlthough both the composition and levels of air pollution can vary dramatically from one location to the other, the 1ARC said its conclusions apply to all regions of the world.\n\"Given the scale of the exposure affecting people worldwide, this report should send a strong signal to the international community to take action without further delay,\" said Christopher Wild, director of the IARC.", "id": "high6090.txt"}
