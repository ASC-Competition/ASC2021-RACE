By delivering text direct to the user's computer screen, the e-book could cut down costs, and allow creators to deal directly with their audience, bypassing   traditional publishers and readers. But it also raises the possibility of mass piracy  . Phil Rance, founder and managing director of Online Originals, a London-based e-book publisher, sums it up. \"No one wants Napster   to happen to books.\"\nIndeed, the most popular MP3 have put the frighteners on   an industry that generally operates some way behind the \"bleeding edge\". The Mata Group, a leading US-based market researcher, says publishers are far too concerned about protecting their rights, \"We believe all the recent legal control over Napster is like putting a finger in a river that is already overflowing. Publishers need to deal with reality and come up with new ways to develop wide electronic distribution  , asking the question: 'How can we use the certainty of wide distribution to our advantage?'\"\nAt the moment, most publishers would like to limit the use of e-books to the person who bought them, or to the computer used to download them.
