You have to buy water from shops. And still there isn't enough for everyone. Your mother has to save the family's shower water to do other things. Would you be able to stand that kind of life?\nProbably not. But _ 's what kids in Yemen are experiencing. Experts said Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water. According to a report, the capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025.\nBecause of the shortage, the government often cuts the water supply. Hannan, an 18-year-old from Lahej, told the Times: \"In a good week we'll have a water supply all week. But then the following week there will be water only for a day or two.\"\nHannan said only rich people have enough water to use. They can buy water from the shops or from the water truck. Private companies own the trucks. They travel around the city every day to sell water - at very high prices.\n\"A lot of people can't afford it,\" she said.\nThe average person in Yemen uses 100 to 200 cubic meters of water per year. That is far below the international water poverty line of 1,000 cubic meters.\nThe government is thinking of making use of seawater. But it will cost a lot and it may not happen soon enough to help the people of Yemen.", "id": "high3807.txt"}
