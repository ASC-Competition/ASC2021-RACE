For four days they saw nothing. Each night they slept in a nearby village, pledging  to make part of the bear's skin against the cost of their lodging  . On the fifth day a huge bear appeared, and Ali said nervously to his friend, \"I don't mind admitting that I'm afraid to take this bear.\" Hagan laughed, \"Just leave it to me, little coward.\"\nSo Ali  _ like lightning up the nearest tree at once, and Hagan stood with his gun at the ready. The huge creature came, moving on in a slow and awkward way, and Hagan began to grow more and more scared. At last he raised his gun to his shoulder, but by now he was trembling so much that, before he could take proper aim, his gun went off and missed the target .\nHagan, remembering that bears never touch a dead body, threw himself flat on the ground and held his breath. The bear came up, sniffed all around him and moved off in the end.\nAli, who had been watching the whole thing from the tree, now came down and, congratulating Hagan on his escape, asked him, \"What did the bear whisper in your ear just now?\"\n\"Don't sell the bear's skin before you have caught the bear,\" Hagan announced.", "id": "high21899.txt"}
