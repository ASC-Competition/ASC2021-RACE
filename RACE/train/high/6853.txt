Later, as The Washington Post's publisher, Katharine Graham became one of America's most powerful women.\nDespite a privileged  background, Katharine had to deal, while growing up, with the high demands her mother placed on her children.Katharine's love of journalism, which she shared with her father, led to her career after college at The Washington Post, the newspaper her father bought in 1933.At the Post, Katharine met Phil Graham, a young, charming lawyer who became her husband.When, in 1945, Katharine's father chose Phil over her to take over his struggling paper, Katharine didn't object and stayed at home as a wife and mother of four.\nWhile Phil's successful efforts to restore the Post to fame made the Grahams popular members of the Washington social scene, Katharine privately suffered great pain from her husband's increasingly harmful behavior caused by severe depression.When Phil committed suicide , the 46-year-old Katharine found herself thrown into a new job, that of newspaper publisher.But determined to save the family paper for her children, Katharine rose to the challenge of running the Post, attending meetings in every department, working endlessly to prove herself to her critics, and becoming the toast of Washington.\nIn 1971, Katharine ordered the Post to print a copy of the Pentagon Papers, the top-secret documents telling the truth about the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War.What's more, her courageous decision and support for her journalists prepared the Post to break the most important political story in modem history: Watergate   , one of the greatest scandals   in American political history.Katharine managed to keep control over the most disorganized situation when it was reported, all the time insisting the news stories be accurate and fair.Watergate made the Washington Post an internationally known paper and Katharine was considered as the most powerful woman in America.", "id": "high6853.txt"}
