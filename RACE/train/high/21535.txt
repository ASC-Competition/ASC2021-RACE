But only ordinary food and healthy habits have been shown to work.\nA research team from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) has designed a four-step plan to improve your memory in just 14 days.\n\"It sounds like another advertisement, but it really works,\" says UCLA psychiatry   professor Gary Small.\nThe team found the four-step plan improved memory function   in teenagers under stress and older people. After a two-week study that included brain-teasers  , exercise and diet changes, test subjects' memories worked more efficiently.\nHere's the programme:\nMemory training: Train yourself with brain-teasers, crossword puzzles and memory exercises that train verbal   skills throughout the day.\nHealthy diet: Eat five rather than three meals a day. The food should be rich in omega-3 fats (omega-3), such as whole grains and vegetables that contain antioxidants  . Having frequent meals helps increase blood glucose  , the primary energy source for the brain.\nPhysical fitness: Have regular physical exercise such as walking, basketball or running, every day.\nStress reduction  : Perform stretching and relaxation exercises. Stress causes the body to release a chemical that can shrink   the memory centres in the brain.\nBefore-and-after brain scans showed that test subjects experienced on average a 5 per cent increase in working memory. This suggests they were using their brains more efficiently. They also performed better on a cognitive   test.\nA control group that didn't follow the plan showed no big changes.\n\"We've known for years that diet and exercise can help people keep their physical health, which is a key part of healthy aging,\" said Small. \"But keeping mental health is just as important. Now we have evidence that people can improve their memories through a programme of memory exercises and stress reduction.\"", "id": "high21535.txt"}
