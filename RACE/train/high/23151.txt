Chinese literature has alyeady attracted international attention, but experts say translation remains a barrier.\n\"Many very good Chinese writers have been accepted globally for a long time already.\"says Michel Hockx, professor of University of London. \" It's mainly because there are many more opportunities for Chinese writers to visit other countries, to publish their work outside China and to interact with readerships abroad. At the same time, more and more people globally are learning Chinese and taking an interest in Chinese language and Chinese culture.\"\nHockx adds: \"We need more good translators, especially foreign translators, who know good Chinese and can translate the work into their own languages in a way that foreign readers will appreciate and understand.\"\nLondon's independent literary agent Toby Eady, who represents many Chinese writers, including Yu Dan, met Mo about 15 years ago in China. But Eady says:\"I still think Mo Yan's writing--and, to an extent, all Chinese writing--are not truly understood by Western readers because a part of Chinese literature is lost in translation. The translator has done a good job in translating Mo's work, but the variety of Chinese vocabulary doesn't well translate into English.\"\nUniversity of Oxford lecturer in medern Chinese literature Margaret Hillenbrand says:\"The obvious reason for the growing global presence of Chinese literature is the growing global presence of China itself. People have come to realize that there is a serious knowledge deficit   between China and its international counterparts   --in particular, China knows incomparably more about Europe and America than the other way around--and reading Chinese literature is an effective means of narrowing that gap.\"", "id": "high23151.txt"}
