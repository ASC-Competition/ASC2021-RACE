Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.\nThe government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.\nFigures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.\nVitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food.
