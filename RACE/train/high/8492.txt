My father died in a car accident,leaving my mother,my two younger brothers and I alone. At that time,I was a senior high school student. After my father's funeral,I had no choice but to drop out of school and work in a factory.\nI really wanted to return to school and wanted to go to college,but I couldn't. I only hoped to bring up my two young brothers. Life was not easy for me,for I can't afford their tuition even if I worked from day to night without stopping. Without my father's protection,I thought I was a slave to the fate.\nLater on,something changed my life. I still remember that it was a rainy day. I put myself in the rain and walked slowly in the street.\nSuddenly the rain stopped!I raised my head and found \"the sky\" was in fact a dark blue umbrella. Then I noticed a middleaged man with one leg on crutch  standing behind me. He said to me,\"Why not run without an umbrella?If you didn't run,you would get drenched.\"\nThe man told me that he was a promoter. He once dreamed of being a policeman,but an accident ruined his dream. Though his present job was not suitable for his legs,it was a wonderful start to him. He was very happy that he didn't lose heart and still \"ran\" on the road of life...\nI was encouraged by the man's words. I went to a big city and  became an assurance representative. After two years' running,I did well and my family condition turned better little by little. Later I returned to school and succeeded in my entrance to university.\nLife is like this. When you are in rainy days in your life,if you couldn't find a way to prevent you from being wet,you would be overwhelmed. But if you decide to get rid of it,you'll discover that the rainy days last not so long as you imagine.", "id": "high8492.txt"}
