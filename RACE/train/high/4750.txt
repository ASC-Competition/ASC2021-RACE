I came to a very busy crossroad where the stoplight had just turned red.\nA young couple, both blind, were walking across the road. Each of them had a white cane . They were overcoming the most feared blindness. I held my breath when I noticed that the couple was not walking on the crosswalk, but was instead stepping directly into the middle of the crossroad. Without realizing the danger they were in, they were walking right into the path of the oncoming cars. I was frightened for them because I didn't know if the other drivers understood what was happening. Then I saw a _ unfold before my eyes. Every car in every direction came to a stop at the same time. Nobody can yelled, \"Get out of the way!\"\nAmazed, I noticed that everyone's attention was also fixed on the couple. Suddenly the driver to my right reacted. He yelled, \"To your right.\"Other people followed, shouting, \"To your right!\"Trusting their elite canes and the calls from some concerned citizens, they made it to the other side of the road. I could judge they had no idea what was really going on around them. Yet I immediately felt smiles appeared on everyone's face. The driver to the left of me was saying, \"I can't believe it!\"\nI thought all of us were deeply moved by what we had just seen. Here were human beings stepping outsides themselves for a while to help other people in deed.", "id": "high4750.txt"}
