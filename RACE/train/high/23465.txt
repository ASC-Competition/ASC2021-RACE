She stepped on the brakes . and stopped just in time.\nBut then she started texting. Distracted , Amanda turned left and right, then crashed into another car.\nLuckily she wasn't in a real car. She was in a driving simulator at Roosevelt High School, Ohio, US.\"I never really realized you swerve that much,\" Amanda, a junior, said. She added that she doesn't text while driving any more. The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and State Highway Patrol brought the simulator to the school. They said they wanted to help students learn about the dangers of driving drunk, while texting, or while talking on the phone.\nLast year, state authorities reported 39 fatalities  , 454 serious injuries and 12,410 crashes caused by distracted driving. Experts said that real numbers are probably higher.\nThe simulator is basically a computer game. Like many computer games, it was a hit with the students. They lined up and crowded around to watch each other take turns. The simulator has a steering wheel , brake and gas pedals  . It is made up of three large computer screens on a table.\nStudents choose a distraction, for example driving drunk or driving while texting. They always crash, of course. Then they are pulled over by police, and learn the bad results of their driving: how much damage they've caused, what their fine is, if anyone died in the accident, and if they're going to go to prison.\n\"It teaches how to drive without being on the road,\" said Shante Thompson, 16. She had just crashed into a deer.\nODOT spokesman Justin Chesnic said hundreds of kids have gone behind the wheel so far. He said even more have benefited from watching their classmates.\n\"Driving is such a major responsibility, so take it seriously,\" he said. \"Put away your cell phone. Don't put your makeup on. Don't be eating or playing with the radio.\n\"A lot of the accidents out there are because of distracted driving. It cannot only change your life, but it can change someone else's life forever. The results are serious.\"MCT", "id": "high23465.txt"}
