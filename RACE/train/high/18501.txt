Here are opinions from our readers.\nAndy: Well, being in British for 3 years now from New Zealand I've come to realize that a lot of British people pronounce words how Americans do. But in saying that, I guess the more educated British people do not pronounce words the way some Americans do. So, I prefer Educated British English.\nBill: Well, I am studying English and I think British sounds funny and I prefer Americans sounds. Although I can tell that everyone else in my class loves British pronunciation and thinks American English is less pretty or even ugly. I don't agree at all, though.\nCindy: At first British English accent sounds better and wonderful but then it gets annoying, so I love American English.\nDale: I prefer the British accent. It sounds like someone reading a poem. I just like the pronunciation of the British people, very clear and sounds like music! British accent is more musical.\nEdward: When I listen to the BBC announcers, I notice that they're exploding the letters out, not pronouncing them. And some British people from the North of England or Scotland speak with strange accents. I mean it is difficult to understand their English.\nFrank: As a matter of fact, English for International Communication is very much like American accent. I love the American accent.", "id": "high18501.txt"}
