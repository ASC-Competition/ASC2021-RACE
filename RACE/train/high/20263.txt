Before I could make the call, I saw a woman walking out of the \" Quickie Mart\" building, then suddenly she slipped on some ice and fell down, so I got out to see if she was okay.\nWhen I got there, it looked like she had been overcome by weep than that she had fallen; she was a young woman who looked  _ with dark circles under her eyes. She dropped something as I helped her up, and I picked it up and gave it to her. It was a coin.\nAt that moment, everything came into focus for me: the crying woman, the ancient Suburban  packed full of stuff and three kids in the back, and the gas pump reading $4.95.\nI asked her if she was okay and if she needed help, and she just kept saying \"I don't want my kids to see me crying,\" so we stood at the other side of the pump from her car. She said she was driving to California for Christmas and that things were very hard for her right now.\nI took out my credit card and swiped it through the card reader on the pump so that she could fill up her car completely, and I bought two big bags of food for her kids in the car who attacked it like wolves. While it was fueling, she asked, \"So, are you an angel or something?\" I said, \"At this time of year, angels are really busy, so sometimes God uses common people.\"\nIt was unbelievable to be part of someone else's miracle. And of course, you guessed it, when I got in my car it started right away and got me home with no problem. Sometimes, angels fly close enough to you that you can hear the flutter of their wings.", "id": "high20263.txt"}
