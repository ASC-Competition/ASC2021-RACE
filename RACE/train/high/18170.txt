I opened my eyes and found it was seven forty, so I jumped out of bed and rushed to a nearby bus stop without breakfast. Fortunately the bus started going as soon as I got on it. I was sure I could reach the school before the bell rang.\nHowever, the bus suddenly stopped. There was something wrong with it and we had to get off and wait for another one. I felt I couldn't  wait and the school was only fifteen minutes' walk, so I ran to the school as fast as possible. Just at this moment, it began to rain hard.\nI reached the classroom with all my clothes wet through. Mr. Smith, our physics teacher, had begun his class. I was always afraid of him. I hesitated  for a moment, and then I opened the door.\n\"It's you again, Jim,\" Mr. Smith said angrily. I've told you not to be late, but you ...\". Then he suddenly stopped when he noticed my wet clothes. He quickly took off his own jacket and asked me to put it on. \"I don't  want you to catch a cold,\" he said kindly. I went to my seat with Mr. Smith's jacket on. It was a bit large for me but I felt very warm in it. I found, for the first time, Mr. Smith's physics class so interesting and I changed my mind, there and then, about being afraid of him.", "id": "high18170.txt"}
