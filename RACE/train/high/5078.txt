As they went along, they saw a pair of old shoes lying in the path. They were a poor farmer's, who was working in the nearby field.\nThe student turned to the teacher, saying: \"we will hide his shoes, and hide ourselves behind those trees, and wait to see what he will do.\"\n\"My young friend,\" answered the teacher, \"we should never make fun of the poor. Why not put a coin in each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch?\" The student did so and they both hid themselves behind the trees. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes.\nAfter putting on his coat, he put his foot into one of his shoes, and felt something hard. Then he bent   down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Surprised, he looked at the coin, turned it around and looked at it again. He then looked around, but no person was seen. He put the money into his pocket, and continued to put on the other shoe. His surprise was doubled on finding the other coin.\nHe couldn't control his feelings and fell to his knees, looked up to the sky and expressed his thanks. Then he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread. He said the help would save them from dying.\nThe student stood there deeply moved, and his eyes filled with tears. \"Now,\" said the teacher, \"are you not much happier than if you had hidden the shoes?\"", "id": "high5078.txt"}
