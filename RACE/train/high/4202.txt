They were accustomed to plastic mats.That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift.On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding.\nWhen we saw the delivery truck coming, we told the family about the surprise. _ . It was like watching excited children on Christmas morning.\nThat afternoon, as we fitted the frames of the beds together, Eric ran into the house to watch us.Too dirty to enter his room, he observed with wide-eyed enthusiasm from the doorway.\nAs my father slipped a pillowcase onto one of the pillows, Eric asked, \"What is that?\"\n\"A pillow,\" he replied.\n\"What do you do with it?\" Eric continued to ask\n\"When you go to sleep, you put your head on it,\" I answered softly.Tears came to my eyes as my father handed Eric the pillow.\n\"Oh...that's soft,\" he said, hugging it tightly.\nNow, when my sister or I start to ask for something that seems urgent, my dad gently asks, \"Do you have a pillow?\"\nWe know exactly what he means.", "id": "high4202.txt"}
