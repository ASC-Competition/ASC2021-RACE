This is not very common in Britain because normally it is a long way from the place of work or school to the home. Consequently the British people tend to have a big breakfast before they go to work and the meal at midday is not spent with the members of the family but with workmates or schoolmates. Lunch is normally eaten between 12: 30 p.m. and 1: 30 p.m. Most people finish work at five thirty. It often takes at least an hour to get home from the school or workplace so people tend to eat their evening meal or \"dinner\" between 6: 30 p.m. and 8 p.m.\nOn Sundays people don't have to work, so they take the opportunity to eat together with their family. Sunday lunch is usually the best meal of the week and many of the meals which are considered typically British are eaten for Sunday lunch. For example roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.\nThis is a typical British family eating together on Sunday. After lunch the father will smoke his pipe and read the newspaper sitting on his favorite armchair while his wife washes the dishes. The children will play traditional English games such as hopscotch, skipping or doctors and nurses.\nAlthough everyone in Britain understands that \"breakfast\" is the first meal of the day, there is a lot of confusion about the words for other meals such as \"dinner, lunch, tea, high tea, brunch and supper\" and if you ask a British person what these words mean, most of them will give you a different answer according to what part of the country they are from or what social class they are from. Another example of this is the pronunciation of the word \"scones\" (a type of cake eaten with Devonshire clotted cream, strawberry jam and cups of tea, known as a \"cream tea\")", "id": "high8753.txt"}
