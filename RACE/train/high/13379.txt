Jonathan prayed that the bell would ring soon, because he wanted to quickly run home before the three huge, fat, smelly bullies   could see him. Every day the three bullies would wait there for an innocent school kid to tease and bully.\nThe moment the bell sounded, Jonathan rushed out with his bag. He sped off across the school field and out onto the walkway. However, all of his effort was useless because leaning on a fence were the three bullies.\nJonathan thought about crossing the street next to him, but it would be too risky. So he hid behind a small bush in hope that the three would leave. But he moved too quickly and was seen by one of the bullies. They approached him then.\nOne bully grabbed Jonathan by the collar of his shirt and grabbed the money out of Jonathan's pocket and put it into his own.\n\"G-Give it back\", Jonathan weakly said.\n\"G-G-Give it b-back\", mocked   the bully. The other two bullies laughed.\nBeside them was a small dirty stream.\n\"Let's throw him in there\", said one of the bullies.\nThen they threw Jonathan into the stream and walked off down the walkway. Jonathan shakily picked himself up out of the creek and continued his walk home with his head down and tears in his eyes. He dared not cry because he knew boys didn't cry.\nJonathan arrived at his house where his mother was waiting outside the front door with an angry look on her face.\n\"Why are you so late and dirty?\" she asked curiously.\n\"I slipped\", he quietly replied.", "id": "high13379.txt"}
