He always read the \"Deaths\" first, and then he knocked once on the table. One of my sisters brought his toast ,already buttered for him. Usually he said nothing, but once I heard him say, \"I love you very much, Edith. I would love you more if you buttered my toast on both sides.\" He read the paper all through breakfast.\nTwo knocks on the table meant \"I am ready for my tea.\" If a single knock followed, that meant \"More toast, please.\" \nAfter breakfast he said, \"Boots.\" The paper was spread  for him over the back of an armchair. Yesterday's paper was put on the chair for his feet, and his boots were brought to him, freshly cleaned. He read standing, at the same time putting on his boots. \nWith one boot finished, he said, \"Bus.\" At that point one of the girls went outside to the garden gate and waited there. Her job was to stop the bus when it came. It came early sometimes, and it had to wait for my father.\n\"Overcoat, hat.\" One of my sisters had already brushed his overcoat.

Another girl came with his hat, nicely brushed. \"Handkerchief, pipe .\" They were brought and put, with his tobacco , into his pockets. \nHe looked out of the window and said either \"Walking stick\" or \"Umbrella\". It was handed to him.\nReady now, he was still reading the paper. He did not put it down until he heard the shout \"Bus coming!\" Then he kissed my mother and went out. The girls breathed freely. \nHow lucky a man is to have a wife and five daughters at home!", "id": "high24157.txt"}
