Around Western schools lots of teens are sporting new holes and \"flesh ink\" . As with all other subjects, the Chinese will surely have to deal with this situation with respect to their children. To get a better view of what has happened in the West, 1et's sit down and hear what they say.\nTiara from Indiana:\nI personally think body piercing is sickening. If there were supposed to be holes in your body,you would have been born with them. I do,however,think that ear piercing is not wrong. There is a difference between ear piercing and belly button piercing. Ear piercing is not nearly as dangerous. I would be sick if someone stuck a needle in my belly button.\nLee from Illinois:\nHi! I live in Illinois. I am 23. I have 12 tattoos and three piercings. I love my tattoos and consider myself an art collector. You would be surprised at who has given me the thumbs up on my art work. People on the street stop me to look at the tattoo on my leg. Most of them don't know what it is. They just think the work itself is great.\nSubotai from California:\nI'm not forbidden of self-expression,but when I see high school students getting these piercings, I really wonder. In some cases, the drive is deeper and darker than mere fashion. A friend of mine tried piercing her own tongue with a safety pin. It got infected and she had a tongue the size of a cow's.\nJackson from Ohio:\nI don't think it is wrong, but when people do it all over the place like their face and everything--I think that's ridiculous. People who get the big \"dragons that cover the whole body--I don't think that's necessary.\" When I see naked chicks on guys, I think, \"You have no respect for women.\"", "id": "high2166.txt"}
