It's easy to assume that people with super memories are super intelligent, but the key to their ability is in the methods that they use to remember information. By learning and mastering some basic techniques, you can also boost your memory. Here are some tips to make it happen.\nGet enough sleep\nSleep is our body's way of \"rebooting\"   out systems. Besides allowing our bodies to recover, sleep also helps our brains to process all of the information that they have received during the day. When we fail to get enough sleep, our brains experience an overload of memory.\nOrganize before you memorize\nIt turns out that brains work much like today's computers do. The more efficiently we store information, the more available storage space we'll have. So when memorizing information, store it into chunks   that are logically grouped.\nUse visual and auditory input\nOur senses have a crucial role in creating our memories. Pictures, graphs, and recordings can help to make our memorization more concrete. These types of techniques are particularly effective for those who are \"visual\" or \"auditory\" learners. Certain  _ techniques work better for certain people.\nMake memorization meaningful\nIt's one thing to memorize facts and figures for the sake of doing it. It's quite another thing to make the information meaningful. Make it personal and seek a deeper understanding of the information. These basic steps will help you to memorize more information, and memorize it faster.\nConnect new information with previous knowledge\nYou'll be able to store information faster, by linking new information that you memorized, with information that you memorized in the past. By linking new information with old information, you'll improve both your short-term and long-term memories.\nWhile not all of us are born with a photographic memory, by using these tips you can transform you brain into a super computer. Forget about needing to say \"I forgot\" throughout the day.", "id": "high23059.txt"}
