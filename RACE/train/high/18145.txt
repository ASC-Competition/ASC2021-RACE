A specific job hunt will be more efficient than a random one .\nSchedule abundant interviews\nUse every possible method to get interviews-answering ads, using search firms, contacting companies directly, surfing the Web, and networking. Even if a job is not perfect for you, every interview can make you learn from it.\nFollow up\nEven if someone does not hire you, write them a thank-you note for the interview. Then. some weeks later, send another brief letter to explain that you still have not found the perfect position and that you will be available to interview again if the original position you applied for-or any other position, for that matter-is open. Do this with every position you interview for, and you may just catch a break.\nMake it your full-time job\nYou can't find a job by looking infrequently. You have to make time for it. If you're unemployed and looking for a job, devote as much time as you would to a full-time job. If you have a job while you're looking, figure out an organized schedule to maximize your searching time.\nNetwork vertically\nIn the research phase of your job hunt, talk to people who are on a level above you in your desired industry. They'll have some insights that people at your own level won't have, and will be in a good position to hire you or recommend you to be hired.\nKeep your spirits up\nLooking for a job is one of the toughest things you will ever have to do. Maintain your confidence, stay persistent, and think positively, and eventually you will get a job that suits you.", "id": "high18145.txt"}
