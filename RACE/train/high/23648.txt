However, a group of researchers have created a robot which looks like the great scientist. \nThe robotic Einstein is very special because the researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) have taught their realistic robot to smile, frown and make other complex facial expressions.\nScientists believe that babies learn to control their bodies through movements, including learning to speak. \"We use the same idea to work out the problem of how a robot could learn to make realistic facial expressions,\" said Javier Movellan, director of UCSD's machine Feeling Lab. ks5u\nThe San Diego researchers directed the Einstein robot's head to turn in all directions. The robot could see its expressions in a mirror and then use the software to provide data for machine-learning to match facial expressions to the movements of its small motors. Once the robot learned the relationship between facial expressions and the muscle movements, it learned to make facial expressions. Its head has about 30 facial feelings, and each is moved by a tiny motor connected to ht e skin by s sting.\nAlthough we've never met Albert Einstein, we have a feeling that the new robot isn't exactly a fair representation of now of the best minds of the 20th century. The figure does not have the grace of the great man, but it can recognize human expressions and react to them in the right way. In fact, if you smile at it, it will smile right back to you.\n\"As far as we know, no other research group has used a robot to make realistic facial expressions,\" said computer scientist Tingfan Wu, a computer science PhD student who worked on a more exact facial expression robot.", "id": "high23648.txt"}
