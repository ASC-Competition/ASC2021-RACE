My dream is to be an actor. Should I give history up?\"\nMaybe you are right. After you leave school, it's not necessary for you to understand everything. But please remember that at school,besides getting knowledge, you should pay attention to some other important things.\nFirst, try to find what you are most interested in. At school, you study many subjects. Try to find what you like and what you don't like. This may be helpful to you in the future.\nSecond, maybe you don't like math and you want to drop it. But the logical thinking ability from math can help you solve some problems.At school, you should practice your brain by thinking.\nThird, you should believe in yourself. Maybe you learn French at school, but you don't need to speak French at all.But learning French can prove that you have the ability of learning languages. Suppose you go to France one day and find a good job well. At school I learned French well, and now I must be able to learn German. But if you have no confidence, what will happen?\nTry to challenge yourself as often as possible. I think many of us like playing computer games. When we fail in a game, we always want to try it again. Why? Because it is hard for us to get the highest mark. If we want to challenge ourselves, we must face more difficult things and make greater progress.", "id": "high1143.txt"}
