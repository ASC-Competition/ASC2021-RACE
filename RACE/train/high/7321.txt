If so, you likely have a case of test anxiety.\nBut, don't be afraid. By recognizing the problem, you are taking the first step towards overcoming it.\nBelieve it or not, a touch of nervousness can sharpen your mind, allowing you to perform more quickly. This is because under stress, the body releases   the hormone adrenaline  , which prepares it for something important that will happen. However, too much anxiety can result in sleeplessness, loss of appetite before tests, and poor performance. Some people might feel hot and tired. With great anger they often shout or complain for no reason.\nIf you worry a lot or are a perfectionist, you are more likely to have trouble with test anxiety. Those who have prepared poorly for a test or have had negative experiences taking tests may also experience test anxiety.\nWhen you feel a storm of anxiety coming on, stop what you're doing and make your mind a blank. If possible, actually tell yourself to 'STOP!' This will get your mind off the stress.\nThen think of being at a place of comfort and let your body relax. As you continue the test, find questions you know the answers to and answer them first. This will help restore your confidence.\nImportant of all, talk to yourself using positive language. Make it a habit to replace each negative thought with a logical reason. For example: \"I've studied hard and I know the material, so I'm ready to do the best I can.\"\nAnother thing you can do is to learn to accept mistakes. In fact, they can be valuable learning opportunities.\nLast but not least, start test preparation early - three to five days ahead of the quiz or test. After all, good study habits and skills - for example, time management and note-taking - will give you the feeling that you are in control.", "id": "high7321.txt"}
