Of these, 2.5 percent were _ , and 33.6 percent said they were vegetarian but also ate fish or chicken.\nThere was no difference in IQ score between strict vegetarians and those who said they were vegetarian but also ate fish or chicken,the researchers added.\nOne expert said the findings weren't the whole answer,however.\n\"We don't know the beliefs or attitudes of the parents of the children,nor do we know if there was a particular event that led these children to becoming vegetarian in their teens or adulthood.\" said Lona Sandon, and assistant professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.", "id": "high5177.txt"}
