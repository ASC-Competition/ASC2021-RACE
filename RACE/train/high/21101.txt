Their color1s in them seem to be used mainly to protect themselves.\n  Some birds like eating locusts  , but birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their color1s together with the change of the color1s of crops . When crops are green, locusts look green. But as the harvest time comes, locusts change to the same brown color1 as crops have. Some other pests with different color1s from plants are easily found and eaten by others. So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night.\nIf you study the animal life, you'll find the main use of color1ing is to protect the animals themselves. Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests. They cannot be easily seen by hunters  . This is because they have the color1s much like the trees'.\nHave you ever noticed an even stranger act? A kind of fish in the sea can send out a kind of very black liquid  when it faces danger. While the liquid spreads over  , its enemies  cannot find it. And it immediately swims away. So it has lived up to now though it is not strong at all.", "id": "high21101.txt"}
