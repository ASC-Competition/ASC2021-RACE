He stopped in front of her car and got out. Even with the smile on his face, she was worried. He looked poor and hungry. He knew how she felt. He said, \"I am here to help you, madam. Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Joe.\"\nShe had a flat tire . Joe crawled under the car, changed the tire. But he got dirty and his hands hurt. She could not thank him enough and asked him how much she owed him. He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the assistance they needed, and Joe added,\" And think of me.\"\nShe drove off. A few miles down the road the lady saw a small restaurant. She went in. The waitress had a sweet smile, and was nearly eight months pregnant. The old lady wondered how someone like her who seemed poor could be so kind to a stranger. Then she remembered Joe. After the lady finished her meal, the waitress went to get her change from a hundred-dollar bill. But she stepped right out the door.\nWhen the waitress came back, she noticed something written on a napkin, \"I am helping you because someone once helped me. If you really want to pay me back, here's what you do ---Do not let the chain of love end with you.\"\nThat night when she got home, she was thinking about the money and what the lady had written. She and her husband needed money with the baby due next month. She knew how worried her husband was, and as he lay sleeping next to her, she whispered, \"Everything's going to be all right. I love you, Joe\"", "id": "high18785.txt"}
