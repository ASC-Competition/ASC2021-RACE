However, they are being told more needs to be done to stop them injuring at work. One in five British workplace deaths happens in agriculture even though farmers are only a small part of the working population. During the year 2012/13 there were 1,061 injuries in total and it is thought many more go unreported.\nJim Chapman from Warwickshire had his arm torn off by farm machinery seven years ago when he was 23. \"You don't realize how much you rely on your second arm until it's gone,\" he said. He fell against a PTO shaft  , a spinning metal bar at the back of a tractor. \"It catapulted   me from one side of the machine to the other,\" he said. \"I landed on the floor, minus all my clothing. My left arm had been torn off.\" He admits that the machinery was missing part of its proper safety guard. \"But again,\" he added, \"it was a rushed day. There were a few machines that didn't work. Also, I was getting behind with the jobs.\"\nOver the last 10 years, other industries that you'd think of as dangerous, like building or quarrying  , have lowered the number of workplace deaths and injures. In the farming industry though, deaths remain high with 34 deaths in 2012/13. \nJudith Hackett, the chair of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says it is \"not acceptable\" that the accident statistics for farming are still high. \"People in farming don't have minor   injuries. When they get injured, it's bad.\" She said. \"When I said to the National Farmers' Union (NFU) that if I had sons I would not want them to work in agriculture, it really made them sit up and take notice.\" There's a whole host of reasons why farming is as dangerous as it is. It is a very rough industry. Also, it's often because people are left alone. They could be young and inexperienced, or older people, who would have retired maybe 5 or 10 years ago in other industries.\nJim wants others to learn from his experience. \"Look at what you're doing before you go running in,\" he said. \"You could make a mistake that you'll live with for the rest of your life.\"", "id": "high17977.txt"}
