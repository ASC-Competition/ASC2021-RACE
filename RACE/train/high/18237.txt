To me, this happened and was only two feet away from me.\nLocating my friend among the passengers, I noticed a man coming toward me carrying two light bags. He stopped right next to me to greet his family.\nFirst he walked to his youngest son (maybe 6 years old) as he laid down his bags. They gave each other a long, loving hug. As they separated enough to look in each other's face, I heard the father say,\"It's so good to see you, son. I missed you so much!\" His son smiled somewhat shyly, and replied softly,\"Me, too, Dad!\"\nThen the man stood up, gazed into the eyes of his oldest son (maybe 9 or 10) and while cupping his son's face in his hands said, \"You're already quite a young man. I love you very much, Zach!\" They too hugged a most loving, tender hug.\nWhile this was happening, a baby girl (perhaps one or oneandahalfyear old) was squirming   excitedly in her mother's arms, never once taking her little eyes off the wonderful sight of her returning father. The man said,\"Hi, baby girl!\" as he gently took the child from her mother. He quickly kissed her face all over and then held her close to his chest while rocking her from side to side. The little girl instantly relaxed and simply laid her head on his shoulder, motionless in pure contentment.\nAfter several moments, he handed his daughter to his oldest son and declared,\"I've saved the best for last!\" and went to give his wife the longest, most passionate kiss I ever remember seeing. He gazed into her eyes for several seconds and then silently mouthed, \"I love you so much!\" They stared into each other's eyes, beaming big smiles at one another, while holding both hands.\nFor an instant they reminded me of newlyweds, but I knew by the age of their kids that they couldn't possibly be. I puzzled about it for a moment then realized how totally attentive I was in the wonderful display of unconditional love not more than an arm's length away from me.  I suddenly felt uncomfortable, as if I was invading something sacred, but was amazed to hear my own voice nervously ask,\"Wow! How long have you two been married?\"\n\"Been together fourteen years total, married twelve of those.\" he replied, without breaking his gaze from his lovely wife's face. \"Well then, how long have you been away?\" I asked. The man finally turned and looked at me, still beaming his joyous smile. \"Two whole days!\"\nTwo days? I was stunned. I had assumed he'd been gone for at least several weeks--if not months. I know my expression betrayed me. \"I hope my marriage is still that passionate after twelve years!\"\nThe man suddenly stopped smiling.\nHe looked me straight in the eye, and with forcefulness that burned right into my soul, he told me something that left me a different person, \"Don't hope, friend... decide!\" Then he flashed me his wonderful smile again, shook my hand and said,\"God bless!\"\nWith that, he and his family turned and walked away together. I was still watching that exceptional man and his special family walk just out of sight when my friend came up to me and asked, \"What are you looking at?\" Without hesitating, and with a curious sense of certainty, I replied,\"My future!\"", "id": "high18237.txt"}
