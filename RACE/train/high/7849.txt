I'm one of those people who look back and wish they had said something smart or witty, or swift.\nEven though that particular student might no longer wonder why I teach, there are days when I wonder. On those days, I remind myself of the real reasons I teach:\nIt's in my blood. My mother was my most influential teacher, and she was a 6th grade reading teacher until her death in 1990. She instilled  in me a love of reading and the knowledge that education opens doors.\nTeaching is a way to make a difference. If you throw a stone in a pond the ripples go on and on until they reach the shore. You can't have ripples without a \"stone.\" Good teachers throw stones that make a positive difference, and that's what I strive to do.\nI genuinely love teenagers. I want to share with others what I know and what I have learned through the years. Life is full of ups and downs, and if I can help students avoid some potholes on the road of life, I want to do so. If they'll allow me to celebrate their victories with them, I want to do too.\nTeaching isn't for everyone, but I know I made the right career choice.", "id": "high7849.txt"}
