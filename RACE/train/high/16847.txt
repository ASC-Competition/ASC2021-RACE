And that led it to be adopted by a much larger tribe--the business tribe.\nYou cannot wear a tie if you work with machinery. So wearing a tie became a sign that you were a man who used your brain to make a living, rather than your hands. It showed you were serious. It showed you were a professional. It meant that everyone who wanted a job in business had to wear one. It was just impossible to take seriously a man who didn't wear a piece of color1ed silk around his neck.\nThis is how millions of people came to be wearing ties across the world. They are part of the uniform of business.\n\"Ties offer a point of indifference,\" says John Milne, head of the British Guide of Tie Makers. \"They give a chance to say something about their own personality.\"\nSo if you happen to meet a man with a very brightly color1ed tie, there is a good chance that he is the office joker.

Seeing that the most powerful man in the world did not have to wear a hat, millions of other men decided that they did not have to, either. Hats simply vanished across the Western world. Perhaps\"tieless Tony\"(UK Prime Minister Tony Blair) will have the same effect as \"hatless Jack\".", "id": "high16847.txt"}
