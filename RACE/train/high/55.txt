Mr. Gordon was too stingy to rent a chair. Their twelve-year-old daughter,Sandra, was playing at the water's edge. Suddenly a huge wave lifted Sandra up and carried her out to sea. Fortunately, a lifeguard was on duty and he saw the wave carry Sandra away. He ran along the beach and dived into the sea. He swam quickly to where the girl, with her head only just above the water, was shouting for help. She was very frightened. When the lifeguard reached her, she struggled with him, as drowning people often do. However, he was a skilful lifeguard and quickly took hold of her and swam with her back to the beach. By the time he reached it, Mr. and Mrs. Gordon had realized what had happened. They had run down to the water's edge. Neither of them could swim. They just stood in the shallow water, and worried about their daughter. Had the lifeguard reached her in time? Fortunately, he had. \"That was quick work,young man,\"Mr. Gordon said. He turned to his wife, \"Give the lifeguard a dollar.\" \"A dollar!\" Sandra cried. \"Dad,how can you give him a dollar! He saved my life. I was half dead.\" \"Quite right, girl\" Mr. Gordon said, pleased by his daughter's awareness  of the value of money. He turned to his wife again and said, \"She's right. She was only half dead. Give him fifty cents. \"", "id": "high55.txt"}
