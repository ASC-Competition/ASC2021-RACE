I am a joyous child. I expect love and respect, order and discipline. When I arrive, I will seem very small to you. Even though I don't look like an adult, please understand that I am a human being.\nEven though I will not speak words to you, I will know you with my heart. I will feel all your feelings, absorb your thoughts. I will come to know you more than you may know yourself. Do not be misled   by my silence. I am open, growing and learning more rapidly than you can imagine.\nI will keep in heart all that I see, so please give me sweet music and language that tells me how much I am loved. Give me silence to rest my ears. I will absorb all that I feel, so please wrap life in love.\nI am waiting patiently to be with you. I am so happy to have the opportunity to be alive. Maybe when you see me you will remember how precious life is too!\nYour joyous child", "id": "high9456.txt"}
