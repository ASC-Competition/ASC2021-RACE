In child raising, the carrot should never be materialistic things. If you want to ask for good behavior with a reward, it should be with something that can't be bought, say, trust. The stick Nowadays, no one likes to use the stick any more, or in my father's case, the belt. I'm not overlooking child abuse, if you ever want to call it that, but I am encouraging parents to toughen up a bit. You don't want your kid to test your limits only to find out he can get away with it. If you want to raise a kid, raise the hand and let him know it comes down on the second offense.\nAt the office\nThe carrot\nPeople need encouragement and motivation to perform well. However, the carrot only really works well with employees who have already proved themselves. Ifyou've got someone who can't show up at the office before noon, the promise of a raise isn't going to do much. On the contrary, if there's a guy with a good work moral, he'll thrive (grow stronger) when you add a promotion to the picture.\nThe stick\nWhen considering the carrot or the stick in the office, remember that, overall, the stick is the more practical method in the office. A wise man, who just happened to be an Italian, once said \"It's best to be both loved and feared.\" It's nice to have everyone love you, but running a business isn't like running a family. You need to have the stick constantly raised.\nWith the wife\nThe carrot\nWhen it comes to marriage, always use the carrot. I've had a lovely marriage for many years, and I've always stuck to the carrot approach.\nSometimes you catch more flies with honey, and sometimes it's the crack of a whip  that gets the horse moving. Try not to use too many sticks at home; the carrot is much more fun.", "id": "high14211.txt"}
