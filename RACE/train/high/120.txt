Some people, however, from the time they are six years old \"know\" that they want to be doctors or teachers or firefighters, but most of us do not get around to making a decision about a job until someone or something forces us to face the problem.\nChoosing a job takes time, and there are a lot of things you have to think about as you try to decide what you would like to do.
