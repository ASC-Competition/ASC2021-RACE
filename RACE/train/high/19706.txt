The following are six cultural differences between China and the US to help promote mutual understanding.\n              \nChinese people do not have the same concept of privacy as Americans do. They talk about topics such as ages, income or marital status, which Americans think is annoying and disturbing.\nFamily \nIn China, elders are traditionally treated with great respect while the young are cared for. In America, the goal of the family is to encourage independence, particularly that of the children. Unlike the Chinese, older Americans seldom live with their children.\nFriends\nChinese people have different meanings to define friends. Just hanging out together time to time is not friendship. Friendship means lifelong friends who feel it deeply necessary to give each other whatever help might seem required. Americans always call people they meet friends, so the definition of friends is general and different. There are work friends, playing friends, school friends and drinking friends.\nMoney\nAs is well known,the Chinese like to save. They are always conservative when they are planning to spend money. It is different in the US, where far fewer families are saving money for emergencies and education than their Chinese counterparts \nEducation\nChinese people value education and career more than Americans, who in turn put more emphasis on good character and faith.\nTeam VS Individual\nBasically China values the community and the US values the individual. If you achieve something in the US, it's because you are great. While in China, if you achieve something it's because the team, or family, or company is great. Everything you do gets attributed to the greater whole, while in America individual merits  are celebrated.", "id": "high19706.txt"}
