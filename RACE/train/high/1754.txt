They admired its beauty! They said it was the most beautiful building in the world. Up on the roof, a little nail heard the people praising everything about the lovely structure - except the nail! No one even knew he was there, and he became very angry and sad.\n\"If I am not important, nobody will miss me if I quit!\" So the nail then released   its hold, got down from the roof, and fell into the mud.\nThat night it rained and rained. Soon, the board that had no nail was blown away, and the roof began to leak  . The water flowed down along the walls and over the beautiful pictures on the walls. The plaster   began to fall, the floor was ruined, and the Biblewas also ruined by water. All this was because a little nail decided to quit!\nBut what of the nail? While holding the board, it was not known by others but it was useful. Buried in the mud now, it was useless and would soon be eaten up by rust!\nWhat the story wants to say is that every member is important to a whole group!\nYou may, like the nail, feel not important at times, but just like the nail, your absence is felt. A big building might fall to pieces. You are important to a group even if you are small.", "id": "high1754.txt"}
