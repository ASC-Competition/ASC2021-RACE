Are you sitting next to a loud person? Tell your teacher or parents about any problem that is preventing you from paying attention.\nTake good notes\nWrite down facts that your teacher mentions or writes on the board. Try to use good handwriting so you can read your notes later. It's a good idea to keep your notes organized by subject.\nPlan ahead for tests and projects\nWaiting until Thursday night to study for Friday's test will make it hard to do your best. One of the best ways to make sure that doesn't happen is to plan ahead. Write down your test dates. You can then plan how much to do after school each day, and how much time to spend on each topic.\nBreak it up\nWhen there's a lot to study, it can help to break things into several parts. Let's say you have a spelling test on 20 words. Instead of thinking about all of the words at once, try breaking them down into five-word groups and work on one or two different groups each night.\nAsk for help\nYou can't study effectively if you don't understand the material. Be sure to ask your teacher for help. If you're at home when the confusion occurs, your morn or dad might be able to help.\nSleep tight\nSo the test is tomorrow and you've followed your study plan--but suddenly you can't remember anything! Don't panic. Your brain needs time to digest all the information you've given it. Try to get a good night's sleep and you'll be surprised by what comes back to you in the morning.", "id": "high1809.txt"}
