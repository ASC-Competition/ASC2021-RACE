As she lived in a small house, where she could not practise without disturbing the rest of the family, she usually went for long walks along the country roads whenever she had time and practised her high notes there.Whenever she heard a car or a person coming along the road, she stopped and waited until she could no longer be heard before she started practicing again, because she was a shy person.\nOne afternoon, a fast, opened car came up behind her so silently and so fast that she didn't hear it until it was only a few yards from her.She was singing some of her highest and most difficult tones at that time and as the car passed, she saw an anxious expression came over the driver's face.He stopped his car suddenly, jumped out and began to examine all his tyres carefully.\nMrs. Janes didn't dare to tell him what the noise he had heard really was, so he got back into the car and drove off.", "id": "high5217.txt"}
