Sams (March 29,2005)\nISBN: 0672327627\nProduct Dimensions: 8.4x5.5x0.6 inches\nOVERVIEW\nThis book offers straightforward practical answers when you need fast results. By working through each 10-minute lesson, you'll learn what you need to begin to use the PHP scripting language to make your websites interactive and dynamic.\nREVIEW\nWhen I first laid eyes on this book and its title, Teach Yourself PHP in 10 minutes, my first thought was that I was going to see this!  So I opened it up and figured I'd look through it for ten minutes and see what would hit me. Well, 10 minutes turned into 20, 20 into 30 and 30 into a valuable resource that sits on my desk.\nNot only are the lessons within brief, but they are very easy to understand, well presented and very easy to understand for the beginner. Each lesson comes with tips to point out shortcuts, cautions to help you avoid common mistakes and notes to additional infomation. This book can be used in two ways, as a reference or as a complete tutorial on PHP basics. That alone is something that is very rare in teaching type books these days.\nSome of the more valuable and informative lessons will take you into the areas of:\n--Strings and variables\n--Processing HTML forms\n--Controlling and filtering data\n--User authentication\n--Cookies and sessions\n--Security practices\n--Configuring PHP and more!!!\nThe book is pretty basic for experienced PHP coders, but for new or intermediate users this book is worth more than the small $19.99 CAN suggested price. Although the cover suggests it covers PHP 5.0, the coding found within also applies to PHP 4.X\nCONCLUSION\nThis book completely surprised me with its value and does indeed teach you in ten minutes what other books claim to do in 24 hours. Full marks to author Chris Newman for this handy guide.", "id": "high15059.txt"}
