Backpacking allows the traveler a greater sense of independence.\n     \"I can no longer put up with the instructions of a tourist guide,\" said Huang Ye, a 19-year-old college student inBeijing. \"They are always driving you to places that you do not want to go to and trying to make you buy local souvenirs.\"\n      Huang likes to travel as a backpacker.
