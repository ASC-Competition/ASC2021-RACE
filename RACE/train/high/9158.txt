Pew researchers found that most Americans believe women have the right qualities to be leaders. But they say women may still not be hired into leadership positions.\n\"On the one hand, the public thinks that women are just as qualified as men to be in top leadership positions, in business and in government, on the other hand the public feels it is easier for men to get those jobs, and the public is also skeptical that things are going to change in the future, particularly on the business front.\"\nKim Parker directs social trends at the Pew Research Center. She says the new study found that Americans think men and women have the same intelligence and ability to create new things. But Americans think women and men have some different abilities.\nFor instance, they believe women are especially good at finding compromises. In other words, women can find ways for people to agree, or at least accept solutions. The study also found Americans see women as more compassionate   and organized leaders than men.\nAmericans also believe women are better leaders for social issues, such as education and health care. But Americans see men as better leaders on national defense and security.", "id": "high9158.txt"}
