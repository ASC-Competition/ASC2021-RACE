Many of the \"Dutch\" expressions heard in American English were first used in England in the seventeenth century. Britain used to be called \"empire on which the sun never sets\",which gained its supreme  power mostly by its naval( )military forces. The period of the Anglo-Dutch Wars was a time of fierce naval competition between England and the Netherlands. At that time, the British used \"Dutch\" as a word for something bad, or false, or mistaken.\nA \"Dutch agreement\" was one made between men who had drunk too much alcohol. \"Dutch courage\" was the false courage produced by the effects of drinking alcohol. And \"Dutch leave\" was what a solider took when he left his base without permission.\nSome of these old expressions are still used today with a little different meaning. \"Dutch treat\" is one example. Long ago, a Dutch treat was a dinner at which the invited guests were expected to pay for their own share of the food and drink. Now, Dutch treat means that when friends go out to have fun, each person pays his own share.\nAnother common expression heard a few years ago was \"in Dutch\", which simply referred to the country then. Nowadays, if someone says to you, you are in Dutch, they are telling you that you were in trouble. An important person, a parent or teacher perhaps, is angry with you.\nSome of the Dutch expressions heard in American English have nothing to do with the Dutch people at all. In the 1700s, Germans who moved to the United States often were called Dutch. This happened because of mistakes in understanding and saying the word \"Deutsch\", the German word for German. Families of these German people still live in the eastern United States, many in the state of Pennsylvania. They are known as the Pennsylvania Dutch.\nDuring the American Civil War, supporters of the northern side in the central state of Missouri were called Dutch, because many of them were German settlers. In California, during the Gold Rush, the term Dutch was used to describe Germans, Swedes, and Norwegians as well as people from the Netherlands.\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt once noted that anything foreign and non-English was called Dutch.One expression still in use, \"to talk to someone like a Dutch uncle\", did come from the Dutch.The Dutch were known for the firm way they raise their children. So if someone speaks to you like a Dutch uncle, he is speaking in a very severe way. And you should listen to him carefully.", "id": "high15648.txt"}
