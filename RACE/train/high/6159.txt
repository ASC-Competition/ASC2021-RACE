Then they decided to move to Chile, which meant they had to cross the Andes Mountains. They and their 20s sons made the difficult two-week journey on horses. One night there was a terrible snow storm in the mountains, during which Mrs Albina gave birth to triplets  , a boy and two girls.\nMrs Albina now has 30 more girls, including the twins who are 15 months old. The oldest Albina children are in their 30s and 40s. They are on their own now, but 18 of the kids still live with their parents in a two-room house. The house has electricity but no toilet or running water. Clearly, the Albinas don't have enough money and food for the big family. Why, then, do they continue to have children?\nThe Albinas do not use birth control because it is against their religion. They can let other people take care of their kids, but Mrs Albina doesn't allow it. \"When we were babies,\" she said, \"our mother left us at an orphanage and never returned. Then a couple adopted my brothers, and I was left behind. I was heartbroken. I promised that when I became a mother I would never give my children away.\"\nSo the Albina family continues to grow. They have so many kids that they run out of names and have to give some children the same name. There are three Susannas, three Miriams, two Estrellas, and two Soledades.\nWill the family stop at 53 kids? Mr Albina is 77, and Mrs Albina is 59. \"I am getting old,\" she said with a smile, \"and I would like God to think of me and consider my age. But if God sends more children to me, yes, there will be more.\"", "id": "high6159.txt"}
