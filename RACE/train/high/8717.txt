Many people begin to feel some goods as theirs when they touch them. They have \"mine, mine, mine\" feeling as little as 30 seconds after touching an object .\nIn a study, some people were shown a cheap coffee cup, and were allowed to hold it for 10 seconds or 30 seconds. They were then allowed to buy it in either a closed or an open place. The people knew the real price of the cup before they began to buy.\nIf people hold the cup for a longer time, he will pay more for it. In fact, people hold the cup for 30 seconds pay more than the others. \"The amazing part of this study is that people can become almost attached to something like a cup.\" said James Wolf,\"By touching the cup and holding it in their hands, they begin to feel the cup is theirs. Once they begin to feel it as theirs, they are willing to keep it.\"\nMany businessmen use this way to sell their things. For example, car sellers send the buyers out on test drives and pet shop owners encourage people to play with the dogs in the window. When you are testing out new cars, you are going to buy it at once. But you can do better if you get ready for it.", "id": "high8717.txt"}
