What confuses a person most is which travel destination to choose. When choosing a destination for a vacation or a trip, you need to decide what that destination has to offer to you. Meanwhile, you should also take many factors into consideration, so that the decision-making will get easy.\nThe amount of money you want to spend is an important factor and plays an important role in deciding a destination. For example, cities like London, New York, Vegas etc are expensive. On the other hand when you travel to Asia, the cost is generally lower and you don't need to spend much on traveling, lodging or shopping. Therefore, it is important to estimate your budget before selecting a destination.\nWhen you plan your vacation, another important thing to plan is the number of the days you want to spend. There are many travel destinations in the world that can be covered in a week's time. Some destinations like Africa, or Maldives beaches can be planned in a week's time. Some other destinations like New York, Thailand may require more than a few weeks to enjoy completely.\nVacations are also planned according to the company you have. For example, if you travel with your family, then you'll need a place where you can enjoy with your family members. Similarly, if you are going with friends, a city full of amusement parks, museums, shopping centers will be an ideal  destination. Therefore you need to consider whom you are going with, before deciding a destination.", "id": "high2515.txt"}
