Sperm whales, of all the whales and dolphins, are the species that dive the deepest and for the longest time.\"\n\"The calves have to follow what's going on below them from the surface as best they can probably listening to the echo location clicks of the adults.\"\n\"However, sometimes the adults re-surface far out of sight of the calf, and in this situation the whales often leap out of the water causing a large bang as their bodies hit the surface. In this way, the whale family could regroup.\"\nHe added: \"When I took the photo, two adults' females had just resurfaced and the calf quite literally began jumping for joy.\"\nMr. Hart captured the rare image four miles from the port of Lajes do Pico while he was working as a crewman on an underwater documentary with special license to film sperm whales in the area.\nSperm whales live in nearly all the world's oceans in groups of about 15 to 20 animals and they practice communal  childcare. The calves do not have to follow their mother too closely as sperm whales can take milk from any milk-producing female in its social group.", "id": "high14206.txt"}
