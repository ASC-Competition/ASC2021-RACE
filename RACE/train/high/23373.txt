And it would look pretty good, wouldn't it? And what better way to regain our title as world's most liveable city? I'm told that we recently lost the right to say this to foreign friends proudly when the international list was re-examined and we slipped to the fourth place. \n         It's hard to see how Melbourne could have lost its crown   when you look at what it has to offer. 24 hours Coles, free transport for drunks on New Year's Eve, a new freeway, it's all here. \n         The first focus for the international press will obviously be the endless stadiums dotted around the city. But as well as being full every other weekend, these great places often play host to slightly older kids. At Rod Laver, even the olds get a look-in as the Christian evangelical   road show rolls into town once a year for a night of stadium worship  . \n         Another pleasure Melbourne enjoys is that it's very easy to get around. There's a bit of a squeeze during rush hour for sure, but nothing like Bangkok, where the journey home can take longer than growing a beard and parking is barely distinguishable from the drive itself. Driving here is a piece of cake. It must be because the wise people who hand out the taxis seem to actively encourage a career behind the wheel within 24 hours of landing in the country as an educational tool for getting to know the city. No slowing down for learning bends, just go, go, go! \n         As for the social life, with over 40 million bars in Melbourne's CBD alone, we have plenty of places for spectators to celebrate national victory, making this town as good as any and it happens 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \n          _ . But the rest of the world will know that this is the place to be. The most liveable city in the world. By far the easiest place on earth to cheat death, which is essentially what we're talking about.", "id": "high23373.txt"}
