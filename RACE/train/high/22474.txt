It can record movies, surf the net, and download the newest MP3 songs, but don't let those fancy features fool you.\nAfter all, chances are that phones have a Global Positioning System (GPS) chip. GPS lets phone companies determine the location of your phone at all times. If you are hurt and call 911, rescuers can find you by using your phone's GPS.\nBut emergency officials aren't the only people interested in knowing where you are. Several new companies are using cell phones with GPS to monitor teen drivers for  _ parents.\nThe programs vary, but most of them allow parents to use the Internet to monitor their kids' locations, driving habits and speed. Some programs even let parents set speed and location limits so that they are alerted  if their kids drive too fast or go beyond a predetermined boundary.\nSupporters of monitoring say that the programs also help if a teen is kidnapped  or lost. Andrea Gutierrez uses a driving program to help her daughter get home. \"I give her directions by looking at an online map, which shows me where she is\".\nJean Nichols, 17, says that parents are forgetting one very important thing: trust. \"I don't like the idea of someone using a device that keeps tabs on me.\"\nOthers say the information could be misused. \"If everyone can find out exactly where your 17-year-old girl is at all times, it will present a potentially dangerous problem,\" Hohn Lawford told the Ottawa Citizen.\nAlana Watenpuhl, 19, says that teens can easily outsmart the programs. \"Teens can always leave their cell phones somewhere and then go out with their friends. It's not likely that the chips are attached to their bodies,\" she told reporters. \"But who knows?\" she added. \"That might be what's coming next.\"", "id": "high22474.txt"}
