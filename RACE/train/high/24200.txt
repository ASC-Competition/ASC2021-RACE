But the first barbecues, in fact ,were the invention of the Taino Indians of Haiti, who dried their meat on raised frames   of sticks over fires. Spanish explorers spelled the Taino word as barbacoa, and as time passed, English settlers along the Atlantic coat had their own barbecues.\nOne summer day in 1773, Benjamin Lynde, a citizen of Massachusetts, wrote in his diary, \"Fair and hot ; Browne; hack overset.\" That is , on a bright and hot day he went to the Brownes to attend a barbecue, and his carriage fell over. It shows that the barbecue had its social occasion by that time. Large animals would be roasted whole on frames over hot fires, and neighbours would be invited to dinner.\nIn later centuries, as settlers moved to the west, the barbecue went along with it, reaching an especially large size in Texas, where a pit   for fuels such as tree branches might be over ten feet deep. Today, the barbecue grills   which are fueled by charcoal   or electricity are likely to be small and easy to move , and can cook only parts of an animal at a time, but people still have barbecues out of doors and always invite their neighbours or friends over.", "id": "high24200.txt"}
