I asked them to write a letter to a friend as if it was ten years in the future. Most of these boys and girls didn't think about the next week,much less ten years to come. Like the Cheshire Cat says in Alice in Wonderland, \"If you don't know where you want to go,then it doesn't really matter what road you take!\" We had some great conversations as they really thought about what they wanted. For most of them, this was the first time they had ever thought this way!\nBut the real story is what happened to me. I did the exercise right along with them on many occasions, writing my dreams and visions in detail. In my letter to a friend, I had moved to the country, built my own home,authored a book,and started my own business. Over the next ten years, something magic happened.All my dreams and visions became a reality, almost as if arranged by an unseen hand. I did write books and start my business. We did move to the country and I did build my own home.\nThis letter to a friend will become a magnetic factor in your life. Your vision will guide you in your yearly goals, your monthly goals,and your daily activities. For example: \"Leslie,I just wanted to make contact again and tell you about my life. I started my own gardening business in 2020 and it's really taken off. \"\nRemember to describe all the details as if they have already happened. Write to a real person who you think may still know in ten years. This will help make it more real for you.\nSit down and write your Ten Years in the Future letter today.", "id": "high9453.txt"}
