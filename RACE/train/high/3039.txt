He was the fifth child and only son of Herbert and Dora Sims. Herbert was a blacksmith , and had a thriving trade making horseshoes. He was determined that his first-born son would follow him into the blacksmith. For this reason, Edward had to leave school at the age of 12,and worked with his father.\nHowever, Edward was _ a blacksmith. Although he has an athletic body, he didn't have strong arms like his father, and he felt dizzy in the heat of the smithy.  When he tried to find alternative employment, he found it difficult because he had never learnt to read or write.\nOne day, he went for an interview at a solictior's office. The job was a runner, taking documents from the office to other offices in the city. The solicitor was pleased to see that Edward was physically fit, but when he discovered that the young man couldn't read or write, he decided against employing him. \"How can you deliver documents to other offices,\" he asked, \"if you can't read the addresses on them?\"\nBitterly disappointed, Edward left the building and went to wait for a tram to take him back to the suburb where his father's smithy was. Next to the bus stop, a man was selling newspapers from a stand .\n\"Excuse me, son?\" he said. \"Would you look after my stand for a moment?\"\nFor the next 20 minutes, Edward sold newspapers, lots of them. When the man came back, he was so delighted with his new assistant's honesty, that he offered him a job. Edward took it immediately.\nIn the next few months, the two men progressed from working on newspaper stands to selling newspapers, tobacco,confectionery and other goods in a shop. Then they opened a second shop, and a third. Eventually, they had a chain of 25 shops in three cities.\nEdward became very rich, so he employed a tutor to teach him to read and write. The tutor  was amazed at what Edward had achieved. \"Imagine what you could do if you'd been able to read and write when you were younger!\" he said.\n\"Yes!\" said Edward. \"I could have run myself to exhaustion delivering documents for a solicitor!\"", "id": "high3039.txt"}
