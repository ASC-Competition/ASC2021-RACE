Not newspapers, at least not anymore. In fact, if you're like most young people, you probably don't read the newspaper at all.\nIn one recent survey, just 19 percent of 18 to 34-year-old said they read a newspaper every day, while 37 percent watch local TV news and 44 percent visit Internet news sites daily. As people turn more and more to new technologies, they turn the pages of newspapers less and less.\n\"There's a revolution   in the way young people get news,\" says media consultant Merrill Brown.\nJust a generation   or two ago, the newspaper was the main way that many people got their news. Now, nearly every home has at least one TV set. There's high-speed, wireless Internet both at home and in many public places.\nYou no longer have to wait for a bundle of newsprint to arrive on your doorstep every morning.

With Web pages, on the other hand, there's more freedom. You can look through the things you're interested in, then follow links to other sources.
