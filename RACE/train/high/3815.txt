Mobile phone SIM cards are inserted  in the collars of elephants. The cards will send a text message when the elephants wander too close to farms, allowing wildlife protectors to drive them off rather than shoot them.\nHungry elephants cause big problems for farmers and villagers in some parts of Kenya when they are searching for food. Two years ago the Kenyan wildlife service had to unwillingly shoot five elephants who continued to destroy crops.\nIn order to prevent such bad activities, the Elephants charity put a mobile phone SIM card on a huge bull elephant called Kimani. The conservationists  then set up a virtual  fence. Each time Kimani came near the fence, a text message was sent to farmers. So far he's been stopped from going into the danger area fifteen times.\nThe project seems to be working successfully as Kimani hasn't come near a farm for four months. A similar system has now been put into operation in another part of the country.\nOne of the biggest benefits of the project is that elephants seem to learn from one another, which can help a whole group change their habits.\nThe elephants can also be tracked using Google Earth software. This is also helping the protectors know where to use their resources to protect the animals well.", "id": "high3815.txt"}
