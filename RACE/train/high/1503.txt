The wheelchair also has two cameras that identify objects in its path.They help the computer react to commands from the brain.\nProf.Millan, the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that interprets brain signals and turns them into simple commands.\"The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two categories: communication, and controlling devices.One example is this wheelchair.\"\nHe says his team has set two goals.One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can benefit from.And the other is to guarantee that they can use the technology over long periods of time.", "id": "high1503.txt"}
