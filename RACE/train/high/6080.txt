How do I know? It's Monday. OK, joking. But, I do predict that today will be filled with the normal last-minute tasks, fire drills, and unforeseen events. So, how do you keep yourself from being swept away in the stream of chaos? How do you remain calm while others are rushing and panicking? There's a problem... Panic! When things don't go as planned, how do you react? Are you the calm one who works to fix things? Or the one running around like Chicken Little screaming that the sky falling? Getting upset or alarmed can seem like natural reactions to a problem.\nHere are a few tips to kelp you remain calm in the face of the storm:\n* Don't Panic  You are better able to find a solution if you    aren't panicking. If you can keep your head when others are losing theirs, you will be able to make a dear decision in the chaos.\n* There Aren't Many True Emergenaes   My time as a Naval Officer taught me about true emergencies. In the military, when there is a problem, people can get hurt or die. This is not usually the case when the office copier or email server goes down. Keep things in perspective. There are very few true emergencies in life.\n* Avoid the \"Fight or Flight\"   When you are stressed, your body will want to go into \"fight or flight.\" Your body was designed to keep you safe from danger, but its natural reflexes aren't always the best solution against a project gone away. Keep your emotions in check and ensure that your physical reflexes don't make bad decisions for you.\n* Head Into The Problem    While everyone else is running away, true leaders walk into a problem. Sticking your head in the sand only makes things worse. Instead of trying to ignore the situition, get to the heart of the issue as soon as possible. Only then can you address it\nHow Will You React? When you find yourself ready to lose it, take a step back. Ask, \"In this truly an emergcncy?\" Keep your head when others are losing theirs. And you'll find that you are that much closer to a solution.", "id": "high6080.txt"}
