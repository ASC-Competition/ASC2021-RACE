Janet Bond was a quiet, little mouse of a child. As far as Anna could remember,she had never had cause to speak an angry word to the girl. \n\"Mrs. Bond,\" went on Mr. Henry, \"tells me that you scolded her daughter yesterday afternoon.\" \n\"Scolded?\" cried Anna. \"I don't scold. At least not in school,\" she added honestly. \"Mrs. Bond's story is that Janet was a little late back to school in the afternoon. She said that the child had to spend some time in the bathroom, which meant she set out from home a little late.\" \n\"Just a minute,\" said Anna, beginning to understand. \"She did come late, very late. I had marked her absent, of course. Then she wandered in, when we'd started our paper--cutting, and I believe I said she was a nuisance . She didn't appear to hear, and was certainly quite cheerful.\" \n\"Ah, a nuisance.\" Mr. Henry jumped on the word. \"You're sure you only said a nuisance.\" \n\"I may not even have said that,\" Anna replied. \"It was no more than slight displeasure that I felt and I certainly didn't scold.\"? \n\"Mrs. Bond said that you called her child a blasted nuisance. Is that true?\"\n\"Indeed it isn't,\" said Anna, \"The child or the mother has made it up!\" \nMr. Henry was satisfied with Anna's explanation. \n\"Just as I thought, my dear, but of course I had to make sure.\"", "id": "high18703.txt"}
