Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips:\nGet the person responsible\nYou need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \"person in charge\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in.\nGet the name of the person\nIf you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her.\nGet past the receptionist\nIn some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out:\n* Call back\nCall back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence   to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \"thank you\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name.\n* Call when the secretary is out\nYou are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through.\nAsk three times for an interview\nSometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe.\nArrange a time\nIf the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time.", "id": "high22544.txt"}
