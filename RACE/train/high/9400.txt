But for her, it is worth it. Te'Anne is one of many talented students who will attend an interview for a musical theatre program at Wexford Collegiate School for the Arts. \"She is someone with unbelievable talent, \" says her music teacher, Ann Merriam . \"Te'Anne works two jobs, so she can support her studies and living expense.\"\nTe'Anne has come a long way since she first came to Wexford collegiate in 9thgrade. She was new to the school and started going out with the wrong crowd. Her negative lifestyle and attitude caused her scores to decline steadily.
