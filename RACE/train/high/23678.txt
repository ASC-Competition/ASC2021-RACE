Patterson has been caught trying to get onto the White House grounds at least three times before Zahren said.\nThe bearded man, wearing blue jeans and a white T-shirt that read \"God Bless America\" jumped the fence outside the White House and ran across the north lawn while repeatedly crying, \"I am a victim of terrorism!\"\nMembers of the Secret Service emergency response team, including one holding a barking dog, ran after Patterson with their guns and surrounded him near the row of cameras set up for television stand-ups.\n\"I have intelligence information for the president,\" he said, waving his arms in the air. \"I'm not afraid of you.\" Patterson screamed at the officers who were ordering him to lie ground with guns drawn.\nPatterson finally kneeled on the ground and was taken into custody  shortly before 4 p.m. He cut his hand jumping the fence and was taken to George Washington University Hospital for treatment and was to appear in court Monday, Zahren said.\nZahren said Patterson was charged with unlawful entry for the last time he jumped the fence, in February.
