All Disney World theme parks are open 365 days a year,although opening and closing time for each park changes from day to day.\nIf you plan to make a trip to the Magic Kingdom without kids,try to visit on a school day to avoid the largest crowds. If you need to visit during a school vacation,try at least to avoid the week between Christmas and New Year and the Fourth of July.\nIf you are not staying at a Disney World hotel,avoid visiting the Magic Kingdom on its Extra Magic Hours days,as Disney's hotel guests get into the park early on those days,and visitors who arrive at the Magic Kingdom's normal opening time have to wait for a long time.\nBefore you go:Buy your Walt Disney World tickets online at Disney World's website. For advice on picking the right ticket,see our guide to Disney World tickets.\nYou will also need to call in advance to make lunch and/or dinner reservations . Disney accepts reservations up to 180 days in advance,but you need contact 1-407-WDW-DINE.\nWhen you get there:Plan to arrive at the Magic Kingdom's front gate before the park opens in the morning. Keep in mind that to reach the Magic Kingdom,you must park at Disney World's Transportation and Ticket Center parking lot,ride at tram to the TTC,then take a ferry boat across the Seven Seas Lagoon to the Magic Kingdom. It makes for a fantastic approach,but takes extra time. Give yourself an extra hour in the summer and half an hour during the school year.", "id": "high8810.txt"}
