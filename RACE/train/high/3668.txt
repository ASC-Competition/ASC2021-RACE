Similar findings were seen in participants aged 45 to 65 years,\" Helfrich's team added in their report.\nThe researchers tested 82 people, smokers and nonsmokers, taking pictures of the inner right arms. They ranged in age from 22 to 91 and half were smokers. Independent judges decided how wrinkled each person's skin was.\nWhen skin is exposed to sunlight, notably the face, it becomes coarse, wrinkled and discolored with a pale yellow tint, Helfrich's team wrote.\nSeveral previous studies have found that cigarette smoking contributes to premature skin aging as measured by facial wrinkles, the study said, but little has been done to measure the aging of skin not exposed to light.\nThe report did not discuss the mechanism involved but previous research has found that cigarette smoke, among other things, causes blood vessels beneath the skin to constrict , reducing blood supply to the skin.\nSmoking can also damage the connective tissue  that supports both the skin and the internal organs.", "id": "high3668.txt"}
