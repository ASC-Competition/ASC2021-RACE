So when the sunny and promising \"big day\" arrived, he was ready. He was armed with a cool haircut, wearing his prized shoes, and was ready for the action.\nTen minutes before the bus was to arrive, he asked me to take him in my car. I complained about it being at the last minute. I said \"no\" at first. He begged me again and I finally agreed.\nIn the car , I secretly had a look at him through the rearivew mirror . He looked sad. \"What is the matter, honey?\" \"I am nervous. I don`t know if I will be able to learn everything in the first grade. What if I can`t pay attention in class?\"\nMy heart melted. I remembered being nervous on the first day of school and I thought I was the only student who felt that way. I was a nervous kid full of self-doubt. Seth behaved much better than I did.\nWe walked into his school together. He remembered where his new classroom was and recognized his teacher from the ice cream social party they had the day before. He sat down at his desk and chatted with a few of his classmates.

I`ll be OK.\" And so he was.", "id": "high7181.txt"}
