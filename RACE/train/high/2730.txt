Kasia Siwosz is proof. For the final year student on the university women's tennis team, the road to Berkeley, University of California was met with poor advice and misinformation from her home country and _ along the way that fell short of expectations.\nBorn in Poland, Siwosz began playing tennis at seven years old and developed the skills that helped her earn a top-50 ranking among the ITF Junior division . Siwosz wanted to do more with her life than just play tennis, which led her to seek chances that would also allow her to obtain a top education. While most who grow up in the U.S. are naturally accustomed to the American tradition of collegiate  sports, such a custom is not as familiar in a country like Poland. \"There's no collegiate sports in Poland and no culture of sports and academic  study there. You can only do one, not both,\" Siwosz said.\nHer desire to have a quality education led her to America to follow her dream. While Siwosz was talented enough to begin her collegiate tennis career, she could only attend community college because she missed the deadline to apply to four-year schools, mainly due to misinformation provided in her home country of Poland.\nWhen she had earned all her credits and was able to transfer , Siwosz made the decision to attend Baylor in Texas. Her friends from Poland put in a good word for the university, saying that it was a good fit because there were many international players at Baylor. \"I thought it would be a good idea, but it really wasn't what I thought it would be,\" Siwosz said. \"I wasn't happy at Baylor. The level of tennis was high, but the academic standards were no match and I just wanted more.\"\nAfter one year at Baylor, Siwosz's luck finally began to change when she made the decision to transfer to Berkeley, which was due in large part to Lee, a former Berkeley student. Lee, who is a keen tennis player himself, met Siwosz four years ago in Texas. \"I knew she was unhappy there,\" he said. \"I saw the opportunity for her to come here.\" Siwosz visited Lee in Berkeley. \"I ended up loving this place and this school,\" Siwosz said. \"I came here a lot over the summer, I _ and I ended up with a Berkeley education and a spot on one of the best college tennis teams in the country.\"", "id": "high2730.txt"}
