If it's used properly, you'll never have to worry about whether you will have to \"friend\" your boss or your mom. You can friend anyone you want while staying comfortable in the knowledge that not everyone gets to see everything you post.\nThe problem with carrying out these privacy options is that they're just too confusing for most non-tech clever people to handle. And often, most people don't want to bother to take the time to learn. To simplify the process, we're offering one easy step you can take today to help make your Facebook experience safer, more secure, and more private.\nJust make \"Friend Lists\". Yes, it will take some time, especially if you're connected to a couple of hundred friends already. But this step, while not the quickest, is fairly simple. And it will be one of the most useful things you can do on Facebook.\nFriend lists, as the name suggests, are lists for classifying your friends into various groups. The nice thing about this feature is that once you set these lists up, you won't have to do it again. We suggest that you put your work colleagues and professional acquaintances into a friend list named \"Work\", personal friends you're not very close with into a list called \"Acquaintances\", and people you're related to into a list called \"Family\". Those three main categories will separate out the groups of \"friends\" who you may want to hide some information from.\nTo create a friend list, click on \"Friends\" at the top of the Facebook homepage. In the left-hand column, click \"Friends\" again under the \"Lists\" section. Now you'll see a button at the top that says \"Create New List\". Click it. In the pop-up that appears, you can name your list and pick members. If you've ever shared an application with your friends, the process of doing this will be very familiar.\nWhen you've finished making lists, you'll be able to use them when selecting who can see what (or who can't!) when configuring   the security settings described below.", "id": "high4705.txt"}
