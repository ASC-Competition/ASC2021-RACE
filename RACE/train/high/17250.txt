Reaction time is affected by the driver's levels of tiredness, alcohol and concentration .\n   Braking distance ( the distance travelled after the driver has applied the brakes) depends on factors such as your speed, type of brakes, type pressure and tread , vehicle weight, wind speed, slope  of the road, surface smoothness and the driver's braking technique.\nRemember: As your speed doubles, your total stopping distance more than doubles.\n   At 60km/hr a vehicle will travel 34 meters while the driver is reacting to the danger, and another 21 meters before the car comes to a stop. Total stopping distance is 55 meters.\n   Total stopping distances shown in the graph are for vehicles with good brakes, on a dry smooth level road surface, and fitted with good tyres with the correct depth of tread.", "id": "high17250.txt"}
