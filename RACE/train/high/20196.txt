He found on arriving at the port that all his  s were having a large party.\nHe was in such a happy mood and in the joy of the moment, he did not even bother changing his grey flannel suit which had become a little worn during the trip home.\nWhen he entered the brilliantly lit room, his  s and friends gave him a rather cold welcome because they had noticed his modest suit and immediately imagined that he had come back a poor man.\nA young man who happened to be accompanying him was quite  _ at this and said to Willy, \"What a wonderful reception you have received from these people. They have not even the intention of shaking your hand after all these years that you have been away from home.\"\n\"Just wait and see!\" whispered Willy, \"They will soon change their looks!\" Saying this he slipped a precious ring on his finger. All of a sudden the faces of all those present lit up and immediately Willy was surrounded by so many people that he didn't know what to do. A man shook his hand, a cousin threw his arms around him, and he had so many invitations from the people present that he thought he would be unable to make any other appointments for several years.\n\"Has this beautiful, precious ring of yours the power of magic people?\" asked the young man.\n\"Oh, no!\" replied Willy, \"They see in this glittering diamond ring something that makes them think I am rich, and, unfortunately, they place wealth above everything else.\"\n\"What blind people!\" exclaimed the young man. \"It is not the ring that has drawn them to you but their desire for riches. Is it possible to appreciate more a piece of yellow metal surrounded by little stones than the goodness of my Lord? And indeed how foolish are people who place their trust in riches rather than in virtues !\"", "id": "high20196.txt"}
