They've seen me do it hundreds, thousands of times. Cool. They are _ to swipe it through the machine themselves. When we walk out of the store with our groceries or pet food, or whatever, it's almost as though money has not changed hands, painless, easy.\nSo it shouldn't be shocking to discover that teenagers are becoming card carrying consumers in their own right. The question is, should they?\nWhile some argue it's best to teach kids how to use a credit card while still living under the family roof, not everyone agrees. Dave Ramsey, financial expert says getting credit card for your teenager is actually \"an excellent way to teach him or her to be financially irresponsible.\"\nNow parents are required to co-sign on credit cards for children under 21. \"If their name is on the credit card, then the parent may say, Hey, my name is on this. Don't get me into trouble,\" says Mary Beth Pinto, a marketing professor. \"When parents were the co-obligors  , the children caused less debt. If the parents are the co-obligors, the tendency is that the parents were explaining how to use the cards.\" Still, Pinto believes parents should start the process much earlier. \"Yes, there has to be teaching going on and it has to start when they're younger. You're not going to get rid of credit cards. They are here to stay. You have to have them. You can't fight progress,\" Pinto said.\nRamsey, however, disagrees. \"Throwing teens into a pool of (credit) sharks is a sure way to guarantee a life-time of heartache.\" he said, \"You can make online purchases and rent a car with a credit card. Of course, you must have money in your bank account before you can make a purchase with a credit card. But paying for things with money is what you are supposed to do.\"", "id": "high6440.txt"}
