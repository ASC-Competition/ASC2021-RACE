She writes beautifully of her family summer cottage in Franconia, Maine. She mentions that every family should have a place to get away together.\n       The summer of my fourteenth year, Dad and Mom planned a wonderful family vacation that I'll never forget. We took a road trip in our 1969 Chrysler. We camped through the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and back home by way of Washington D.C. To save money, we stayed in a tent and cooked our own meals on a camp stove. It was a wonderful vacation. Whenever we could, we talked Dad into staying at a campground with a swimming pool.\n       We camped in a large tent big enough to sleep eight average-sized people who didn't mind sleeping close enough to hear one another breathe. It wasn't a cottage in Franconia, but served a similar purpose for our family. Most nights I slept in my own small tent. Each night I went to sleep listening to the music or sleep to the sound of frogs.\n        In Maine, we didn't have a cottage in the mountains or a house on the lake. I doubt if we ever will. But I have happy memories of a family vacation, looking into a campfire, swimming with my brothers and my sister and walking under the stars.", "id": "high20900.txt"}
