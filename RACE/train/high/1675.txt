All of a sudden, the textbooks on the bookshelf began to fall to the floor. The glass in the window broke.\n\"It felt like our dormitory building was being hit by a tractor,\" recalled Diao. \"I wasn't afraid.. I was even excited and curious. Now, looking back, it was a scary experience.\"\nDiao and his roommates kept their calm. They didn't try to get out of the building until the shaking stopped. They were on the fifth floor and they feared there might be trouble if they didn't remain calm.\n\"We've watched lots of disaster films, and that helped us keep cool,\" he said. \"Only one student sprained  his ankle. He was escaping in a hurry. Most of us got outside quickly and safely.\"\nThey were surprised to see so many students outside.\n\"I began to realize then what had happened,\" he said. The college had warned them that in the event of an earthquake, they should leave the dormitory immediately. A few did rush in when it was safe to grab some clothes to keep warm.\nWithout any tents or bedding, the students stayed on the football field for the whole night. Rain started falling in the morning, but the students all kept in good order. They simply chatted and shared their feelings and comforted each other.\n\"Our students seemed to have self-control,\" he said. \"I heard that hospitals in Chengdu have lots of injured people who jumped out of buildings.\"\nNow, Diao is mostly worried about the people in Wenchuan County.\n\"It seems we won't be able to have classes in one or two day's time,\" said Diao. \"I want to become a volunteer at the damage-hit area, or donate my blood to the injured people in hospital. Also, I will write on my blog to keep people calm and encourage them to protect themselves during emergencies.\"\nSince the university is close to Dujiangyan, Diao and his classmates are still forbidden to return to their dorms or classrooms. However, they can eat in the canteen and get information about other parts of Sichuan by reading the newspapers.", "id": "high1675.txt"}
