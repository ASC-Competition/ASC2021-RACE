He certainly did not consider that he took great pains over anything, he did just enough to get it right. Exactly right, of course, for as he was fond of telling his staff, \"if it's not exactly right, it's wrong\". Occasionally a worker might be sad on hearing these words, because it meant another hour or so of going over the same bit of work, correcting the mistakes which Cameron had patiently pointed out. And doing the corrections exactly right of course.\nStrangely enough, his department had the reputation for performing the highest quality work in the company, and it was seen, and not only by those who worked in the department, as a sort of elite   unit. Those programmes that had to work first time, straight out of the box, Cameron's men got those. \"It's mission   critical--give it to Cameron\" was almost a catch-phrase with his team.\nIt helped that Cameron was not merely particular about things. He wanted things done just so, not because of a personal taste, but because he had discovered through patient experimentation that this was the best way for it to be done.\nIn Cameron's dictionary, \"Take as long as you want\" meant that you could work on your task not just in office hours, but that evening, and late into the early hours of the following morning if you so desired. But the project had to be in by its completion date, and yes, done exactly right. Or you did it again.\nBut he would always be regarded, and not least by himself, as someone who had failed to meet requirements, one of those _ . You had to face it, if you were not working for Cameron, you were second best. So when word got out that Cameron had messed up, big time, the news was greeted with a mixture of sympathy, and entire relief that this perfection too was human.", "id": "high2421.txt"}
