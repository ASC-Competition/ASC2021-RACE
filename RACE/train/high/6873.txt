He set off, walking towards the king's castle. After many years of walking, the king's castle came into his view. However, as the boy drew closer to the outside of the castle, the guards noticed him.\n\"Get out of here!\" ordered the guards.\nWell, _ . He turned...and ran. All he wanted to do was to tell the king wonderful things, and see all the beautiful things in the king's house. But he couldn't even get near the castle!

He saw the little boy and stopped. \"What's wrong, young man?\" he asked.\n\"Sir, I walked and walked just to see the king. But these guards made me scared.

You can enter the castle and be with the king.\" Said the man.\nThe little boy broke into a huge smile.", "id": "high6873.txt"}
