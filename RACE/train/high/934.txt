Government officials said more than three million hotel rooms were already lined up under the project, which is being backed by a range of companies, including Butlins. Attractions, such as the London Eye and Alton Towers, are also taking part. Reduced prices will also be offered on stays on the Royal yacht Britannia, now harboring in Leith, Edinburgh, and visits to Chatsworth, the historic house in Derbyshire.\nTourists will be able to take advantage of the discount by using a dedicated website before the end of the Paralympics on September 9 to make bookings for this year and 2013.\nMr. Hunt said, \"With the Diamond Jubilee and the 2012 Olympic Games, this year is the perfect opportunity for more of us to holiday in the UK \"\nMr. Hunt has travelled the UK, urging companies to take part in the scheme, telling them, _ We will never have a year like 2012 to show the world that this is, quite simply, the most exciting, vibrant, cosmopolitan city on the planet. The unavoidable complaints in the run up to an Olympics must not cloud the scale of the opportunity --including our biggest ever tourism marketing campaign to make sure we get a lasting benefit from being in the global spotlight. \"\nThe scheme will be promoted by a PS3 million television advertising campaign -- the first of its kind in the UK.\nThe government hopes the \" Holidays at Home are Great\" campaign -- launched by Visit England -- will create 12, 000 jobs, create 5.3 million extra short overnight breaks, and generate PS480 million in extra spending over three years.", "id": "high934.txt"}
