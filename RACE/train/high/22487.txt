But now as grown-ups, some adults find they cannot leave childhood behind. They become \"kidults\" (kid+adult). Being a kidult has become a lifestyle-choice among young people across Asia.\nSome kidults collect toys they once played with.  Hello Kitty, Garfield, and Snoopy have many adult fans around the world. It is not unusual to see a 20-something woman with a big, Garfield-shaped cushion on her sofa or a Hello Kitty mobile phone accessory.\nOther kidults still enjoy children's stories and fairy tales. For example, Bloomsbury even published the Harry Potter novels with an adult cover. That way, no one else on the subway will know that an adult is actually reading a children's book!\n\"Kidults can be like vitamins to society. Adults who value their childhood and hold on to pure, child-like emotion may be needed in such a rough and dry society,\" said Lee Sojung, professor of Foreign Studies at Hankuk University. He added that kidult culture may fill the generation gap between adults and kids. It could give children and their parents books, movies, and cartoon shows to enjoy together. He may be right.\nTim Greenhalgh, a professor, explained that some kidults just refuse to grow up. They cling to  childhood because life in a busy and stressful city frightens them. Kidults would like to forget their age and openly show their fear of society and adulthood.\n     \" So, they can escape from increasingly complex and stressful lives that are hard to deal with.\" Greenhalgh said.", "id": "high22487.txt"}
