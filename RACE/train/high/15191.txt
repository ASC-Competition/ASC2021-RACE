There a lot of foreigners stayed for night. He didn't know any other language but English and he found it difficult for him to understand the foreign visitors. Sometimes he had to use the gesture to talk with them, and tried his best to make himself understood. But he was often misunderstood   and it brought him a lot of trouble. A friend of his who taught a few foreign languages in a university would teach him. He was happy and studied hard. At first he learned some, but soon he found it wasn't very easy to remember the words and expressions. His friend advised him to write down the useful expressions in his notebook so that he could use them when necessary. He did as he was told. He found it helpful for him to do so.\nOne evening there were plenty of people in the dining-room. They were all busy eating something except a Japanese. He was wandering   there and waiting for his wife who was dressing herself up upstairs. Mr. Jackson thought to himself, \" The man wants to eat something but he doesn't know any English. Let me help him.\"\nAs he knew only a little Japanese, he had to bring out his notebook and showed it to the man, pointing to the sentence \"I'm hungry.\"\nThe Japanese had a look at it and gave him two pounds and left.", "id": "high15191.txt"}
