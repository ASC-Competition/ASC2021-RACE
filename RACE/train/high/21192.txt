Quite simply because no one tells us how to fail so that failure becomes an experience that will lead to growth. We forget that failure is part of the human condition and that every person has the right to fail.\n        Most parents work hard at either preventing failure or protecting  their children  from the knowledge that they have failed. One way is to lower standards. A mother describes her child's hurriedly-made table as \"perfect\"! Even though it couldn't stand on uneven (not same in height) legs. Another way is to shift   blame. If John fails in science, his teacher is unfair or stupid.\n       The trouble with failure-prevention methods is that they leave a child unequipped for life in the real world. The young need to learn that no one can be best at everything, that no one can win all the time and that it's possible to enjoy a game even when you don't win. A child who's not invited to a birthday party, who doesn't make the honor roll or the baseball team feel terrible, of course. But parents should not offer a quick comfort prize or say \"It doesn't matter\" because it does. The young should be allowed to experience disappointment and be helped to master it.\n       Failure is never pleasurable. It hurts grown-ups and children exactly alike. But it can make a positive contribution to your life once you learn to use it. Step one is to ask  \"Why did I fail?\" Control the natural impulse   to blame someone else. Ask yourself what you did wrong, and how you can improve. If someone else can help, don't be shy about asking them.", "id": "high21192.txt"}
