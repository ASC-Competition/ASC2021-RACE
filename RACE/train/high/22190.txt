We got a date from the moving company to move our belongings, but we weren't sure what to do about the car. We had moved before, but never so far. We thought driving our car across the country wouldn't be good for us or the car, and we were pretty nervous about entrusting   our new SUV to anyone.\nA friend suggested Mountainside Auto Transport. Moving day arrived, and Mountainside's driver showed up right on time. We had agreed to meet early in a shopping mall parking lot right down the street from us. When I saw the truck I realized why. It was huge! We watched as the driver skillfully guided our car onto the truck and waited while he secured it in place. Then he was off, and we were free to spend some time saying good-bye to our families before enjoying a relaxing flight across the country and settling into our new home.\nJust over a week later, we were pleasantly surprised when Mountainside called us to say they were able to deliver the car the next day -- 4 days earlier than we expected. The delivery was more smooth than expected.\nWe have to say that it certainly was a wise decision to use Mountainside Auto Transport to move our car. They were very nice people who were a pleasure to do business with. \nThey were the right people to deliver the car.
