We meet them every day. A few days ago, my car was not running well. I pulled it into a garage and the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes. He knew what was wrong by simply listening to the engine. I was amazed. The sad truth is, great talent is not enough.\nI am constantly shocked at how little talented people earn. I heard the other day that less than 5 percent of Americans earn more than $100, 000 a year. A business consultant who specializes in the medical trade was telling me how many doctors and dentists struggle financially. It was this business consultant who gave me the phrase, \"They are one skill away from great wealth.\"\nThere is an old saying that goes, \"Job means' just over broke  ' \". And unfortunately, I would say that the saying applies to millions of people. Because school does not think financial intelligence is intelligence, most workers\" _ \". They work and they pay the bills.

They focus on perfecting their skills at building a better hamburger rather than the skills of selling and delivering the hamburger.", "id": "high89.txt"}
