Her father has hit out at the \"Victorian\" methods. \nChorlton High School put up pictures of year 10 pupils who teachers believed had behaved badly. Children singled out for praise were placed on the wall of fame. Its head teacher said the scheme   was designed to motivate pupils. \nCarlo Robinson, whose daughter Josie was put on the wall after missing lessons, wants to make a complaint. The teenager had been missing school and turning up late because she was upset that her mother was ill. She said: \" I thought it was embarrassing.\"\n Mr Robinson added: \"She was in tears. She couldn't tell me at first - it took her about an hour- because she wasn't sure what I would think of it. When she told me I was really shocked. I contacted at least 20 friends and they all agreed it was wrong - it's like Victorian times.\"\nHead teacher Andy Park said: \"We've successfully used a similar scheme in the past with Year 11 students to  _ pupils and it really did make a difference - pupils took it in the right spirit and were motivated by it to improve their performance. Obviously this latest scheme wasn't intended to cause offence to pupils. It was actually developed to praise the students moving forwards successfully and to support pupils who needed to make improvements. No parents have complained directly to the school and I'd be very happy to meet with any parents to discuss further.\"\nMr Robinson told the reporter he had contacted the school to schedule a meeting with the head teacher.", "id": "high20906.txt"}
