Then I remembered the surprise celebration I had planned for my friend Nancy on her 60th birthday. We  were roommates on a threeweek tour following the Silk Road on those famous steppes   --and through the  mountains--of central Asia.\nThat  afternoon  we  had  arrived  at  our  hotel  in Samarkand,Uzbekistan. The young man at the hotel desk told me about a bakery about 10 minutes away. After giving me detailed directions,he added,\"Your nose will let you know when you arrive there.\"\nThe temperature was 40 degC.Soon,\n  _  \nproved to be an unfailing guide. Outside the bakery,a delicious smell greeted me.\nThere were several kinds of breads,cookies,and cakes on display. There were also beautiful iced cakes. I chose a cake topped with powdered sugar.\nLater at the Karim Bek Restaurant,Nancy didn't see the young waiter walk up the steps with the cake.When I began singing\"Happy Birthday,\"everyone at our table--except Nancy--joined in.\nIt took her a moment to realize what was happening. Then the grinning    guest of honor thanked me,blew out the candles on the cake,and ate three pieces of it.\nToday,after reliving this experience in my mind,I told my husband to ignore my request.I now understand what a surprise party is about:It is not about having a surprise party but rather the delight in giving it. That is what brings the satisfying joy.", "id": "high15576.txt"}
