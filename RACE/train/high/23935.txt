When diapers and baby talk become just too much, adult talk is just a click away. But for some moms, the attraction of the online world becomes too strong to resist  and instead of being an occasional thing, it becomes an addiction .\nColeen Moore of the Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery says she is seeing a growing number of young stay-at -home moms for whom blogs and social networking have become a passion, which will harm their real-world lives.\nNow, Internet addiction is not officially recognized as a mental disorder. But a recent survey showed 14 percent of Internet users find it hard to stay away from their computers for several days at a time, and that 8 percent use the Web to escape problems. Considering this, it is probably just a matter of time before it is.\nWhat drives a mom to the Internet is not different from what drives an alcoholic  to drink: an empty place that needs filling. \"In addiction treatment, we talk about the fact that there's a void ,\"says Moore. \"Whatever that void may be -- whether it's emotional, spiritual, physical--we're trying to fill it.\" So, how can you find the void? A journal tracking when and why you go online and what you may be avoiding when you do so can be helpful in finding it out.\nBut what makes Internet dependence special is the fact that usually it is not just a way to escape the tiring parenting or make a connection with others, but also a way to make a statement and be heard.", "id": "high23935.txt"}
