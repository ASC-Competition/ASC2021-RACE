Together they eat in the finest restaurants, traveling everywhere around the world by luxurious planes and pleasure ships. They are models.\nDo you envy them? What sort of life are models leading? Is it a wonderful life for a young lady or a young man?\nA few models are well-known actors or actresses who can make a lot of money only by showing themselves off in commercials. But the majority of them are just curious to see what it is like. They'd like to be models just because they are attracted by what they imagine -- models earn a lot of money and lead a glorious life. This is true for those who are very successful. However, most models find it difficult to get work. Very few can earn enough to live on, and for all models their expenses are high. Their agents claim about 20% of the earnings, and no model will get very far without a clever agent. Besides, they have to buy good clothing. They also have to pay to travel to interviews and reach the places where the work is to be done.\nInterviews for a model job are known as cattle-markets in the modeling world, and not without a good reason. A top model can choose his or her work, demand and receive high fees and has his or her expenses paid. But for most models, the situation is quite different. And agent or employer inspects each model much as a farmer inspects cattle at a market. Intelligence, qualifications and personal characteristics count for little against good looks and tight figures. For all except the very few lucky ones, the life of a model is a continual search for work, trying to sell himself or herself in the face of fierce competition and, sometimes, not particularly moral standards on the part of some employers.\nImmigration officials at airport look suspiciously at a girl whose passport shows her occupation as \"Model\", and these are men and women of considerable experience of the world. It comes no surprise to find that some models prefer to put \"Secretary\" or \"Businessman\" as their jobs in their passports.\nModeling is a changeable world with great rewards for a tiny minority but not for the majority.", "id": "high8854.txt"}
