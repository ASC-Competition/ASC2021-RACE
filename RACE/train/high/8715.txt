The risk of international spread would be further  _  if this epidemic were to take hold in other countries, especially those with weak public health systems.\n\"The international community must be mindful and be ready to support the early detection and control of cases.\" Dr. Khan said.\nDr. Khan noted that of the almost 500,000 travellers who flew on commercial flights out of Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone in 2013, more than half were headed to destinations in five countries: Ghana (17.5 per cent, Senegal (14.4 per cent), the United Kingdom (8.7 per cent, France (7.1 per cent) and Gambia (6.8 per cent). More than 60 per cent of travellers from those countries in 2014 are expected to have final destinations in low- or lower-middle income countries.\n\"Given that these countries have limited medical and public health resources, they may have difficulty quickly identifying and effectively responding to imported Ebola cases\", said Dr Khan.", "id": "high8715.txt"}
