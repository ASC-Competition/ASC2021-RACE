It is the perfect design for the biography of a man who insisted that even the insides of his products be perfectly constructed, and that his factory wails flash in the whitest white.\nThe cover was the only part of the book Steve Jobs wanted to control, writes Isaacson in his introduction. Though Mr. Jobs pushed the biographer of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin to write in his own way, generously allowing the writer more than 40 interviews, this book offers quite a different view of Mr. Jobs, who won much praise from his fans after his death on October 5th at the age of 56.\nAs a biographer of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, Mr. Isaacson knows how to celebrate long-dead genius, but he claimed that \"Steve Jobs\" would not be entirely praiseful words. The picture he paints, particularly in the first half of this book, is not nice. Mr. Jobs emerges as a controlling and often cold-blooded character. A child of the 1960s counter-culture  , he hated, materialism and lived in simply furnished houses ( in part because he was too particular about furniture). But when Apple went public in 1980, he refused to give any share to Daniel Kottke, a Iongtime supporter and soul mate from college. \"He has to abandon the people he is close to,\" observes Andy Hertzfeld, an early Apple engineer.\nMr. Jobs was undoubtedly possessing an extraordinary ability to attract others and inspire a kind of faith that could not be questioned. But also he could be cold and cruel. If he disapproved of an employee's work, he often shamed him. \"This is who I am,\" he once said after being challenged,\"and you can't expect me to be someone I'm not. \" This disgusting personality wasn't always helpful,but it served a purpose, writes Mr. Isaacson, many would \"end their chain of horror stories by saying that he got them to do things they never dreamed possible. \"\nMr. Isaacson treats \"Steve Jobs\" as the biography of record, which means that it is a strange book to read so soon after its subject's death.", "id": "high3140.txt"}
