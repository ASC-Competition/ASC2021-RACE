So the Los Angeles native took matters into his own hands and started making his own dinners. One of his specialties? Trout with braised leeks .\nNow 13, the young chef is being praised as a \"food prodigy \". He will spend his summer apprenticing with some of the best chefs at LA's famous restaurants, MSNBC Nightly New reports.\nMc Garry began making a name for himself in the culinary  world when John Sedlar, owner of the trendy Playa Restaurant, let Mc Garry take over the kitchen for a special nine-course meal. The meal sold out almost instantly.\n\"Flynn is a very unusual young man, and he's very, very passionate,\" owner John Sedlar told MSNBC.\nBy usual teenage boy standards, it's true. So strong is his passion for cooking that the young man has turned his bedroom into an experimental kitchen laboratory.\nInstead of video game consoles, baseball trophies and movie posters, Mc Garry's room is lined with mixers, pots and pans, cutting boards and a stainless steel worktable. It's where Mc Garry cooks his monthly pop-up dinners, which are served from his family's dining room, a monthly supper club he calls Eureka.\nMc Garry is deft  and confident in the kitchen, with skills he's been practicing since he was a child. What started out as a means of self-preservation from his mom's unsatisfactory cooking has turned into a passion that the teen hopes to develop into a career.\n\"My goal? Michelin three stars, a restaurant in the top 50 list,\" he told MSNBC. \"Hopefully the top five.\" Meanwhile, Mc Garry's 13-year-old resume is already richer and more impressive than most cooks many times his age.\nMc Garry isn't the only talented young prodigy to surprise experts in his field in recent years. At just 17 years old, physicist Taylor Wilson is already teaching graduate-level courses in physics and has built a functioning nuclear reactor.", "id": "high3731.txt"}
