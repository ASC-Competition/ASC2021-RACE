Today, high heels are strictly a female fashion that is easily found in stores. High heels are the hit items featured on the runway and are widely worn by celebrities. For instance, in the popular TV drama, Sex and the City, the main character, Carrie, is a lover of high heels that in almost every episode, she purchases a pair of gorgeous 4-inch high heels. Carrie loves the heels so much that she even sets her email address as \"shoe girl\". This clearly shows how much modern women love high heels.\nEven though high heels are popular, they are not the most comfortable shoes to wear. In many ways, high heels have already changed the shape of people's lives. Doctors have warned that continuous wear can cause back pain and serious damage to the knees. Though it is yet to be proven, some psychological reports suggest that high heels can lead to mental disorder, as it is stressful to the people who wear high heels, in the sense that they have to bear the pain in every step. According to Mayann Los Russo, chief editor of Footwear News, high heels are desirable because they make people appear taller. She says, \"I think it goes back to the idea of pain before beauty.\" Indeed, some people feel that they always need to look appealing in front of their peers.\nStill, Dr. Casey Kerrigan, a professor at Harvard Medical School, warns, \"It takes a long time to feel the effects. And once you do, it's too late.\" Despite the damage high heels can do to the feet and legs, they remain popular. Most women accept the pain because they like how they look wearing high heels. It is important that we all understand that we should never hurt ourselves just to please others.", "id": "high19117.txt"}
