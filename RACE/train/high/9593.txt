Russia has declared plans for its first floating hotel, 217 miles above earth, and it is something of an offering with good service.\nHosting just seven guests in a four cabins, the accommodation will boast huge windows with views back to earth and tasty microwave meals will be served instead of the ones often used by astronauts.\nJust getting there will be an adventure in itself--it will take two days aboard a Soyuz rocket--and it won't exactly be a _ holiday: A five-day stay will cost youPS100, 000 toPS500, 000 for your journey. The hotel is due to open by 2016 and, according to those behind it, will be far more comfortable than the International Space Station (ISS) used by astronauts and cosmonauts.\nIn the weightlessness of space, visitors can choose to have beds that are either vertical or horizontal. Tourists, who will be accompanied by experienced crew, will dine on food prepared on Earth and sent up on the rocket, to be reheated in microwave ovens. Many kinds of delicacies will be available.\nIced tea, mineral water and fruit juices will be available, but alcohol will be strictly prohibited. Toilets will use flowing air instead of water to move waste through the system. Waste water will be recycled.\nSergei Kostenko, chief executive of Orbital Technologies which will construct the hotel, said: \"Our planned module inside will not remind you of the International Space Station. A hotel should be comfortable inside, and it will be possible to look at the Earth. The hotel will be aimed at wealthy individuals and people working for private companies who want to do research in space.\" The hotel can also be used as an emergency bolthole   for astronauts aboard the International Space Station if there is a crisis.", "id": "high9593.txt"}
