But he didn't go quietly. In his final speech, he blamed the Jewish people for the problems between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\"The Jews have taken land of the Muslims,\" he said. \"What if part of America was given to the Jews as Israel? Would the Americans let it happen? Of course not.\"\nHis words angered many western governments, but Mahathir doesn't care. \"I like to speak my mind,\" the 77-year-old explained. \"Sometimes people don't like it. But that is what leadership is all about.\"\nLoved by some and disliked by others, his 22 years in power have seen great changes in Malaysia. He has taken it from being one of Asia's poorest countries to the world's 18th largest trading nation. It is also a peaceful country with native Malaysians living alongside minority groups. Chinese make up a quarter of the population, while a further 7.4 percent are of Indian origin. Teenage girls wearingMuslim1headscarves happily walk around large stores as ethnic Chinese playmah-jong2in nearby cafes.\nBut Mahathir has made enemies at home and abroad and some people will be glad he has gone. The US was unhappy when he often blamed it for globalization. Meanwhile, critics say that he has limited the freedom of the Malaysian people in order to stay in control of the country. Despite this, he is a hero to leaders in Southeast Asia as well as those in theIslamic3world. \"He marked out the path to success for developing nations in the region to follow,\" said Thai President Thaksin Shinawatra.\nNow he just wants to enjoy his retirement and insists that he will not take on a special role in government. \"I'm a nobody,\" he said. But many Malaysians do not agree with this.\nNotes:\n1    Muslim  adj. \n2    mah-jong  n. \n3    Islamic  adj. \nChoose the best answers according to the above:", "id": "high7678.txt"}
