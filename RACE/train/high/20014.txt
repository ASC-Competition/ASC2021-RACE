Bad smoke from a car can get into the air. This bad smoke is called pollution.\nPollution turns the air a gray  color1. It is very dirty. It is not good for people to breathe this dirty air.\nTo keep pollution down, the states tests cars every two years. This test checks to make sure the cars do not pollute the air. If a car does not pass the test, the owner cannot drive it the next year.\nSome car owners drive their cars even though they cannot pass the test. It is also very bad for the air.\nPeople want to find a way to get these cars off the road. So a state program  was started that now seems to be helping. In this program the States buys cars that cannot pass the test or will help pay for repairs. This program has been helping people buy better cars or fix their old ones. It has also been helping to cut down on pollution.\nTo meet the needs for the program, a car must be drivable and the owner must meet certain income  restrictions . In order to get help from the program, a motorist must have a family income of no more than 185% of the national poverty guidelines . For a family of four, that would be no more than $32,653 each year.\nThe state program that takes polluting cars off the road has just finished its first year, and people say it has been successful.\nFor the past year, the state program has been buying cars that can't pass the test. Some car owners get as much as $1,000 for their old ones, while others receive as much as $500 for repairs.\nThe cars bought by the States through the program are put out of use and sent to dismantlers .", "id": "high20014.txt"}
