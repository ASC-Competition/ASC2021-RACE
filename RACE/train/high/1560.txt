The Boss was a hard man. He fired people who didn't do well without giving them a second chance.\n\"Watson,\" said Mr. Smith, \"this past year your department hasn't earned money. We're going to _ that department. It's finished. I' m sorry, --but you'll have to go.\" \"But, sir--if I just had a little more time. For the moment I need the job to keep my son at Riverside School.\"\n\"What's that!\" said the Boss. \"Riverside! I didn't know you had a boy there. That's an expensive school for a man with your salary.\"\n\"I know, sir. But he likes it there so much! He's a star trackman  and the best boxer in the school. The boys call him Champ  there.\"\nThe Boss sat perfectly still for a long time--a faraway   look in his eyes. Then, suddenly, he said, \"We've got to close your department, Watson. But you'll take over a new job in another department. It means longer hours--maybe more pay. Now get out. You're here for life.\"\nWatson got out, with surprise in his face. Then the Boss took a letter from the top drawer of his desk. It was Herbie's last letter from Riverside School --written a few days before he died. He had read it over and over again with sick pain. The letter read: I can't say the boys here are any nicer to me than the others were. I guess it's the same everywhere when you're a cripple  . But don't worry about me, Dad. They've got a good chemistry department here. And there's one boy here who is really great. He's a track star and boxing champ and just tops in chemistry. The boys call him Champ. He made them stop throwing my books around. And he knocked a boy down who hit me. He is the best friend I ever had. Dad, when I grow up, I want to do something for Champ. Something big--that he won't even know about.\nYour son,   Herbie", "id": "high1560.txt"}
