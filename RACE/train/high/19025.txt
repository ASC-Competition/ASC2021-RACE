Her photos of Bettie Page in a bathing suit standing next to a real cheetah  are still well-known today.\n\"They all wanted to model for me because they knew that I wouldn't take advantage of them,\" Yeager told The Associated Press during a 2013 interview.\nIn the 1940s, Yeager became one of the most photographed models in Miami during her early career. She later turned the camera on herself, in bathing suits she made for her 5-foot-9 frame by hand. Her self-portraits  were turned into a book, How I Photograph Myself, in 1946.\nShe began taking photos of Page in 1954 as she began her job behind the camera.\nShe published about a dozen books. And her works have been displayed in art galleries across the world.\nYeager said she had a few requests when several magazines began to struggle or went out of business over the last decade, but her career returned to the public in 2010 when the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh held an exhibition of her works, followed by another exhibition in Miami in 2013.\nIn her studio, Yeager kept some photos no one had ever seen in galleries. They will be included in a new book Yeager was finishing, scheduled for publication in September, celebrating the 60th anniversary of Yeager's first photo shoots with Page, Christin said.\n\"I'm still feeling like a little child and excited about everything new that comes along in my life,\" Yeager said in 2013. \"I don't know where it will lead to yet, but it sounds good to me.\"", "id": "high19025.txt"}
