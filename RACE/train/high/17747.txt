Therefore, the new findings \"cannot overcome the accumulated evidence that aspirin is not particularly effective for the primary prevention of death from cardiovascular disease in women.\"\n      \"This is a complicated issue,\" said Dr. Andrew T. Chan, leading author of the new report. \"We understand that aspirin has potential health benefits, but who would aspirin therapy  be appropriate for?\" There are \"areas of disagreement that need further study\" before that question can be answered, Chan said. But there is information from the two large studies and other trials that can help guide women and their physicians, he said. And anyone who is thinking about daily aspirin \"should really talk with doctors about the benefits and risks.\"", "id": "high17747.txt"}
