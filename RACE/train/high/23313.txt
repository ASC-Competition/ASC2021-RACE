There is no evidence to prove the advantages of drinking eight glasses of water a day,scientists say.\nThe misunderstanding is caused from the suggestion that adults should drink 2.5 liters of water daily,which was highlighted(,)by the British Medical Journal in December.The important part of the suggestion that most of this quantity of water is contained in prepared foods,however,is usually ignored.\n    U.S.researchers who reviewed the evidence concluded that most people do not need to worry about the amount of water they drink every day.Besides drinking water,they will be getting plenty of liquid in other ways.Caffeinated drinks such as tea,coffee and cola,and alcohol  can help reach the daily total if they don't drink too much,though these drinks help the production of urine .
