The female jobless rate has hit 7%.  \nThis is a dramatic change of the trend over the past few years, where the rates of male and female unemployment barely differed, at about 5%. It also means that women could soon overtake men as the majority of the prefix = st1 /USlabour force.  \nMen have been badly hurt because they dominate those industries that have been affected: 9 in every 10 construction workers are male, as are 7 in every 10 manufacturing workers. These two sectors   alone have lost almost 2.5 million jobs. Women, in contrast, tend to hold more stable jobs and make up 75% of the most unaffected sectors of all: education and healthcare.  \n\"It protects them a little bit and softens the blow,\" said Francine Blau, a labour market economist at CornellUniversity. \"I think we are going to see this pattern until the recovery.\"  \nThe widening gap between male and female joblessness means many US families are totally reliant on the income the woman brings in. Since women earn on average 20% less than men, that is putting extra stress on many households.", "id": "high23382.txt"}
