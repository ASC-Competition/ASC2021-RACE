Her contribution to mathematics was in both algebra   and differential and integral calculus  .\n    Mary was one of the world's first famous female mathematicians. She became interested in mathematics and decided to study it at the time when it was considered unacceptable for a woman to do so. She bought books on algebra and geometry and read them at night. In spite of disapproval from people around her, she firmly went on with her struggle to learn. She won a prize for her solution to an algebra problem. She went on to write several books on mathematics. Later in her life, she thought deeply about the years in which she had persevered   almost without hope and said, \"It taught me never to lose heart.\" \nMary's way of learning remains useful today. If she worked for a while on a problem without coming up with an idea, she stopped working and turned her attention to the piano, her needlework, or a walk outdoors. She then returned to the problem with a fresh mind and a solution turned up. If she could not understand a passage while reading, she would forget about it and read on; several pages later, the meaning of the puzzling passage would become clear to her.", "id": "high17765.txt"}
