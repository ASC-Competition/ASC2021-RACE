That is because the television program by that name can now be seen in so many parts of the world. That program became one of American's exports soon after it went on the air in New York in 1969.\nIn the United States more than six million children watch the program regularly. The viewers include more than half the nation's pre-school children, from every kind of economic , racial , and geographical group.\nAlthough some educators object to certain elements in the program, parents praise it highly. Many teachers also consider it a great help, though some teachers find that problems arise when first graders who have learned from \"Sesame Street\" are in the same class with children who have not watched the program.\nTests have shown that children from all racial, geographical, and economic backgrounds have benefited from watching it. Those who watch it five times a week learn more than occasional  viewers. In the US the program is shown at different hours during the week in order to increase the number of children who can watch it regularly.\nThe programs all use songs, stories, jokes, and pictures to give children a basic understanding of numbers, letters and human relationships. But there are some differences. For example, the Spanish program, produced in Mexico City, devotes more time to teaching whole words than to teaching separate letters.\nWhy has \"Sesame Street\" been so much more successful than other children's shows? Many reasons have been suggested. People mention the educational theories  of its creators, the support by the government and private  businesses, and the skillful use of a variety of TV tricks. Perhaps an equally important reason is that mothers watch it along with their children. This is partly because famous adult stars often appear on it. But the best reason for the success of the program may be that it makes every child watching feel able to learn. The child finds himself learning, and he wants to learn more.", "id": "high7391.txt"}
