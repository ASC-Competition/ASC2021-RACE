The highest number ever seen in one year is 445, in 2008.\n\"We only need four more to break our record,\" said Lee Evans, who runs the British Birding Association. \"With three months to go I'm sure we'll do it.\"\nLast month an extremely rare Siberian Rubythroat bird was seen in Scotland, sending hundreds of birdwatchers north in the hope of catching a glimpse of this colourful Asian beauty. Another very uncommon bird, the bufflehead duck was cited in Cornwell and caused similar excitement. \"I couldn't believe it,\" said Evans. \"The poor thing was completely  _ . It must have been blown to England by the storms while trying to fly from Canada to the southern United States for the winter. That's 3000 miles!\"\nEvans said that global warming over the past decade was playing a key role in transforming bird movements across the world. In addition, melting Arctic sea ice may also be opening up bird flight paths over the North Pole, making it easier for birds from the Pacific -- such as the slaty-backed gull and tufted puffin, both of which appeared in London earlier this year -- to reach Britain.\nBird-watching is becoming an increasingly popular hobby among all age groups, added Evans. \"A fifth of our members are under 18. This is a round-the-year hobby that you can enjoy from the kitchen window or from a car. More and more people are bird-watching, and as a result more and more unexpected species are being spotted in the British Isles.\"", "id": "high20466.txt"}
