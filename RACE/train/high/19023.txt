You might think that because he works in a convenience store that he's not the brightest guy you're likely to meet. Yet this slightly scruffy young man in his Nike sneakers , was smart enough to break a fake story that successfully fooled the world for 35 years . \"I guess I just got lucky,\" West smiles. \" It just goes to show you don't have to finish high school to be smart.\"\nForty Years' Study\n\"I've spent 40 years in astronomical study, and 20 years of that specifically in Satellite Systems study. I have a University chair in three major Universities and sat on 5 different governmental committees on Space Exploration. Hell, I wrote a research paper on the Lunar Landings that took 18 months to research, then a further 3 months just to correct it.\" Steven pauses to scratch his head. \"Yet not once did it occur to me to wonder who filmed Armstrong as he stepped onto the moon. How could I have been so stupid? \"\nThe Evidence\n* If Armstrong was the first to walk on the moon, then who filmed him walking down the ladder?\n* There's no gravity on the moon, so why didn't the astronauts just float away?\n* It's really hot on the moon, so Armstrong should have died of thirst.\n* The deadly radiation belts around the Earth turn everyone radioactive and make your eyes boil unless you are wearing 18 inches of lead . So how did they get through it?", "id": "high19023.txt"}
