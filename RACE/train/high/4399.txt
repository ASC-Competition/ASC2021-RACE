After making sure of the user's eye movements,the technology is then able to easily find where a person's eyes are moving,and then allow the eyes to control a cursor .\n\"Our software can then determine the location of the eyes and know where you're looking on the screen to make sure what you're looking at,\"reads an explanation on the Eye Tribe site.\nThere has been a gradual change toward hands-free technology in recent years, particularly in the gaming world.Recently Xbox released the Kinect device,which lets users control their Xbox and play certain games using only their hands,legs and voices. But still,most of these devices have been more of a _ than a practical way to use one's hands to control a mobile device.Johansen said a replaceable filter would be a cheap,convenient way for most consumers.\nAnd even as companies like The Eye Tribe work to create such a product for the average user, making the eye-controlled technology more accessible and less expensive will have similar benefits for physically disabled users.\nFor more articles on modern science,please CLICK here.", "id": "high4399.txt"}
