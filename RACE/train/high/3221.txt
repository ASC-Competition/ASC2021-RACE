Land mines are small bombs hidden in the ground and designed to explode  when someone steps on them.\nWhen trained, the rats can smell special metals in the mines and then signal  to their human team. Then why use rats for such an important job?\nIn the past, dogs have been used to find bombs. Rats have a good sense of smell and can respond to orders, just like dogs do. But rats are much lighter than dogs. They stand less of a chance of setting off the mines, which explode under a certain amount of weight. What's more, the best rats are cheaper to keep than dogs. It costs about the same amount of money to take care of one dog as it does 70 rats.\nThe rats have already been used in Tanzania, an African country with many land mines. Luisa Fernanda Mendez and her team in Colombia are training the even lighter Wistar rats. These are the white rats with red eyes that scientists often use in laboratory experiments. \" _ even train their babies to perform their jobs, which saves us a lot of time, \" Mendez said.\nColombia has the second-highest rate  of deaths from land mine accidents in the world. Last year, land mines killed 695 people -- 56 of whom were children. A criminal group called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, as well as other organizations, have placed the mines. FARC are strongly against Colombia's government. The group has placed mines all around its own bases and in many places in the countryside.\nIn the past, the Colombian government hired peasants and poor farmers to find mines. Many of them died trying to find the well-hidden bombs.\nColombian police official Erick Guzman hopes the team of rats can come to the rescue . \"These rats will be a great help,\" he said.", "id": "high3221.txt"}
