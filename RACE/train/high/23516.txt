Since I was a little girl, if I ever wanted to purchase anything, my parents would sternly  remind me of the value of every cent, prompting me to spend my pocket money only when necessary. My mom actually came up with a system that we strictly abide  by in regards to money-spending. She gives me a certain amount of allowance  every month, and whenever I buy anything with my accumulated  money, I keep track of my receipts and record it in a little notebook, essentially a tiny version of my mom's own accounting booklet.\nBeing in control of my own money has really taught me to be careful in how I spend my money, giving me a sense of responsibility and ownership over it.\nAs for earning money, aside from my allowance, my parents never really encouraged me to go out and find a job at typical American occupation locales , such as restaurants or clothing stores. Instead, they would prefer that I spend my time focusing on my schoolwork, which I guess is where my parents become more traditional. Yet I still earn money here and there in little jobs, such as teaching students at my school, and of course, writing for the paper.\nThough I have several friends already working, I am pretty happy with my current situation. I am able to focus on my studies, all the while earning quite a bit of money, and also learning monetary   skills that are  _ to survival in the real world, and for that I am grateful.", "id": "high23516.txt"}
