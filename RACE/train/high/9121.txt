He seemed most unfriendly and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I bought nothing, and marched angrily out of the store. My _ toward that clerk increased with each step.\nOn the outside, standing by the road, was a dark-skinned young man in his early twenties. His expressive brown eyes met and held mine, and in the next instant a beautiful, dazzling smile covered his face. I gave way immediately. The magnetic power of that smile dissolved all bitterness within me, and I found the muscles in my own face happily responding.\n\"Beautiful day, isn't it?\" I remarked in passing. Then, I turned back. \"I really owe you a debt of gratitude,\" I said softly. His smile deepened, but he made no attempt to answer. A Mexican woman and two men were standing nearby. The woman stepped forward and eyed me inquiringly. \"Sir, but he doesn't speak English,\" she volunteered. \"You want I should tell him something?\"\nAt that moment I felt transformed. The young man's smile had made a big person of me.\n\"Yes,\" my reply was enthusiastic and sincere, \"tell him I said 'Thank you!' \"\n\"Thank you?\" The woman seeded slightly puzzled. I gave her arm a friendly pat as I turned to leave. \"Just tell him that,\" I insisted. \"He will understand; I am sure!\"\nOh, what a smile can do! Although I have never seen that young man, I shall never forget the lesson he taught me that morning. From that day on, I became smile-conscious, and I practice the art diligently, anywhere and everywhere, with everybody.", "id": "high9121.txt"}
