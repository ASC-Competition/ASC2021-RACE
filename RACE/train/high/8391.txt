They were wearing dirty blue trousers and looked like farm boys.\nWe sat down for a rest. We felt that we didn't need any practice against a team like that.\nThe game began. One of us got the ball and he shot a long pass to our forward  . From  out of nowhere a boy in an old T-shirt stopped the ball and with beautiful style  he shot and got two points. Then another two points in a minute. Soon the game was all over. We were beaten by the country team.\nAfter that, we thought a lot.

And the most important lesson we learned was: One can't judge   a person or a team only by their clothes.", "id": "high8391.txt"}
