Well, I'll tell you why it's one of the best movies ever. The Sound of Music simply has everything one could want in a movie.\nFirst of all, it has a real romance--one where you can watch the _ slowly fall in love.\nSecondly, it has humor, clever and sarcastic  humor. When Schraeder said, \" Bye, Maria, I'm sure you'll make a fine nun .\" You just want to slap  her across the face after hearing that.\nThirdly, it's got adventure. The Nazis are the worst \"bad guys\" in any movie, so it's great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit  them.\nFourthly, it's got great music. The songs of the film are popular all over the world.\nFifthly, it's got great scenery. The plot  and dialogue are also amazing. I find new things to admire each time I watch.\nFinally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns showing the stolen Nazi car parts? In short, the film doesn't just succeed because it cheers people up with a beautiful love story or songs. It also succeeds because it's a wonderfully-constructed, wonderfully-written, and wonderfully-acted movie.", "id": "high6861.txt"}
