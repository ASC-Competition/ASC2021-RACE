That is a question I have been struggling with a lot lately. My mother and I used to talk on the phone a few times a day. I saw her at least twice a week. Now she doesn't answer when I call, and never calls me back. She doesn't see me and then complains that I don't see her enough.\nIt all started a few months ago, I started having a date with a man, and we became serious quickly. This is not the first boyfriend I have had. I know she isn't mad at me for my finding love. The turn-in events happened when I moved from about 15 minutes away from my mom to 1.5 hours away from her. She encouraged it, she seemed happy, and she helped me pack. Since then, everything has changed.\nI can't tell if she cares about me and I don't know if she is bitter. When I call her, she says she is busy and will call me back. Then the problem is that she never calls me back, I make plans with her, but she cancels. Then when I do see her, she gives me comments like \"It's been a while since you came to see me\". It seems like I haven't tried. It's very frustrating.\nI don't know what is wrong, and she won't talk to me, so I can't find out. Does anyone have any advice for what to do in a situation like this? Part of me wants to cry and stop trying. But not talking to her tears me apart. Please give me some advice below.", "id": "high19054.txt"}
