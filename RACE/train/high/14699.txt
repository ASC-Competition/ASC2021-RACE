After the seal came across a boat in the harbor where he lives, he fell inside and wouldn't _ for four days.\n\"One morning the seal just pulled himself aboard,\" says Ed Stubbings, who owns the boat-turned-bed. Probably thinking the boat was a rock, the seal made himself at home. The seal didn't move an inch-----not even to eat or drink.\nStubbings was a little worried that the 500-pound animal might sink it. Luckily on the fifth day, the seal fell back into the water and swam off.\nAlligator gets new tail\nWhen Mr. Stubbs the alligator swims through his pool at the Phoenix Herpetological Society, he looks like any other gator-----except that his tail is made of rubber. Mr. Stubbs is the first alligator known to wear an artificial tail.\nMr. Stubbs was brought to the society nine years ago. \"His tail was missing when he arrived,\" says President Russ Johnson. Mr. Stubbs couldn't walk or swim properly. \"We showed him how to swim in the water,\" Johnson says. \"But that hurt his back.\" Later, the scientists used rubber to build an artificial tail attached to Mr. Stubbs's back legs. \"Once we put the tail on him, he walked with ease,\" Johnson says.\nDog delivers papers\nMorgan started her \"paper route\" when she was young. One day as Morgan and her owner Bill set out on a walk, she spotted a rolled-up paper.

Morgan enjoyed the activity so much that she wanted to deliver every paper she saw on her walks.\nNow three-year-old Morgan brings the paper to her owner and neighbors, even in bad weather. \"Morgan has a natural instinct  to carry things with her mouth,\" dog behaviorist Pat Miller says. \"And she feels rewarded by the activity, so she keeps it up.\"", "id": "high14699.txt"}
