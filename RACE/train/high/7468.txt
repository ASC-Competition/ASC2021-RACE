Today tourists looking for a taste of the country's historic lifestyle find varying levels of understated elegance in ryokans throughout the country.\nA typical stay starts with a greeting from the inn's staff and a change from street shoes into slippers .An attendant leads guests to their rooms, where slippers are removed before walking on the rice-straw flooring, called tatami.
