The robbing of the three ships Sunday was about 600 miles outside the normal operation area for the international force, said a spokesman.\nThe spokesman said the attack so far out at sea was a clear sign that the international patrols against pirates were having a \"marked effect on pirate activity in the area\".\n\"Once they start attacking that far out, you're not even really talking about the Somali basin or areas of water that have any connection with Somalia,\" said an officer, Roger Middleton. \"Once you're that far out, it's just the Indian Ocean, and it means you're looking at trade going from the Gulf to Asia, from Asia to South Africa. \"\n\"This is the farthest robbing to date. They are now operating near the Maldives and India,\" said another officer.\nThe three ships--the MV Prantalay 11, 12, and l 4--had 77 members on board in total. All of them are Thai, the spokesman said. Before the Sunday robbing, pirates held l l ships and 228 sailors.\nPirates have increased attacks over the past year in hopes. of catching more dollar payments. Because of increased patrols and defenses on board ships, the success rate has gone down, though the number of successful attacks has stayed the same year over year.", "id": "high1749.txt"}
