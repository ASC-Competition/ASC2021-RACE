I think everybody should study ants.\nThey have an amazing four-part philosophy, and here is the first part: Ants never quit. If they're headed somewhere and you try to stop them, they'll look for another way. They'll climb over, or around. They keep looking for another way to get where they're supposed to go. What a great philosophy.\nSecond, ants think summer all winter. That's an important perspective. You can't be so childish as to think summer will last forever. So ants are gathering their winter food in the middle of summer.\nThe third part of the ant philosophy is that ants think winter all summer. That is so significant. During the winter ants remind themselves, \"This won't last long; we'll soon be out of here.\" And on the first warm day, the ants are out. If it turns cold again, they'll dive back down, but then they come out on the first warm day. They can't wait to get out.\nAnd here's the last part of the ant philosophy. How much will an ant gather during the summer to prepare for the winter? All he possibly can. What an incredible philosophy, the \"all-you-possibly-can\" philosophy.\nWow, what a great lecture to attend--the ant seminar!", "id": "high16965.txt"}
