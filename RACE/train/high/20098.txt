At least two billion are expected to be online by the end of this year. The ITU(International Telecommunicaiton Union) says more than 70% of new Internet users this year will be in developing countries. However, only 21% of the population of the developing world is online -- compared to 71% in developed countries.\n    There are still very huge divides when it comes to connecting to the Internet. In developing countries, there are only one out of five people using the Internet. In Africa, only 10% of the population is using the Internet. Less than 16% of homes in developing countries are connected to the Internet. But, on the other hand, mobile phone usage has reached 68% in developing countries.\n    The world has almost seven billion people. Nine out of ten are connected to mobile networks. The ITU says that mobile users will reach five billion three hundred million this year. Most of them are in the developing world. More and more people in developing countries are using their mobile phones to connect to the Internet.\n    Mobile technology is already improving lives in developing countries. People can bank by phone, enjoy e-health services and so on. And people can enjoy more as broadband, or high-speed connections become more widely available.\n    ITU Secretary General Hamadoun Toure believes broadband is the most powerful tool available in the race to meet the Development Goals by 2015.", "id": "high20098.txt"}
