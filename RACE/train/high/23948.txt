The book explains why we eat what we eat and how we can control our eating.\nMost of his suggestions are based on scientific studies he has conducted as director of Cornell University's Food and Brand Lab.\nHere are 10 of his tips for the holiday season:\n1 People tend to eat more when distracted   by conversation or a game on TV. Setting your chopsticks down and giving full attention to the conversation will prevent overeating.\n2 See it before you eat it. Eating chips from a bowl led one group to consume 134 fewer calories than others who ate straight from the bag.\n3 Keep the evidence on the table, such as chicken bones, cake papers, and candy wrappers  . Studies have shown that leaving the wrappers and remains of food on the table leads diners to eat less.\n4 Budget calories. Do not eat the appetizer   if you know you want dessert. It will be easier to count how many calories you consume.\n5 Sit next to the slowest eater at the table and try to eat slower than him or her. Always be the last one to start eating, and set your chopsticks down after every bite.\n6 Don't avoid the food you really want, but eat it in smaller portions  .\n7 The more variety, the more people will eat. When there are a smaller number of dishes on the table people eat less.\n8 Put foods that are unhealthy in the back of the cupboard  , the back of the refrigerator, the back of the freezer. You can also \"hide\" food that is bad for you. Office workers ate 23 percent less candy when it was in a white, covered candy dish than in a see-through one.\n9 Use small bowls. A study found that people serving themselves from smaller bowls ate 59 per cent less.\n10 Use tall, narrow glasses for drinks. Even experienced waiters poured more into short, wide glasses than into thin ones.", "id": "high23948.txt"}
