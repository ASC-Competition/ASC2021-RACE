It's the kids of course. Whatever the setting, the question I get asked the most is \"Will the kids be alright?\" It has made me realize that we tend to look at the glass half-empty rather than half-filled when it comes to mixing work and family. We forget about all the benefits that we bring to our children when we work - and I'm not talking about the obvious financial benefits, although these of course shouldn't be taken for granted.\nAbout a year ago I remember getting a call from the school just as I was pulling up to the house after having driven 20 minutes to the school and 20 minutes back. \"Mrs. Brown Quinn, your son asked us to call. He forgot his sports clothes. Can you come back to the school and drop them off?\" I was exasperated ! I had already spent 40 minutes in aggressive weekday morning traffic.

They are constantly calling their parents for help.\" You'll love that moment! After all those years of complaining about why you don't do this or why you don't give them that, your kids realize that tough love has made them better people.", "id": "high12471.txt"}
