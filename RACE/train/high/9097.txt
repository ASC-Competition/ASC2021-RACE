They say the drug could be ready for human medical test in about 18 months.\nThe disease, spread by the bite of a fly, is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system. It has similar symptoms  to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose. Left untreated, it moves to the brain, resulting in mental confusion and final death\nThe \"breakthrough\" came at the University of Dundee in Scotland, where scientists were offered money to research diseases ignored by major drugs companies.\nProfessor Paul Wyatt, director of the programme, said: \"This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for ignored diseases.\"\nHe said the research, published in the journal Nature, represented \"significant progress\" in the development of a full blown drug against the disease.\nThe World Health Organization said there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year, with a further 60 million people at risk of infection.\nThe research in Dundee was _ by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, Canada. The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have problems. One is with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other is costly, only partially effective and requires long-time hospital treatment, the scientists said.", "id": "high9097.txt"}
