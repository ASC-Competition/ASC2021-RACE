Since materialsfor making a medicine to cure a sickness can be found everywhere, one can practise folk medicine in any place of the world.\nThe use of folk medicine goes all the way back to the time of the earliest man when both man and animal used plants and herbs to keep healthy. It is usually seen that an animal eat snakeroot after being bitten by a poisonous snake. Because animals seem to have this natural ability for knowing which plants and herbs will cure what sickness, man probably learned how to care for himself by animal watching.\nMan also learned other things from animals. He observed that wild animals, when sick, kept quiet and rest, getting well with the help of the medicine in plants and pure air. He saw that an animal with a fever could often be found resting in a cool place, eating nothing, and often drinking water until the fever was gone.\nSome believe that folk medicine deals with a lot of old wives' tales which have something to do with the medical treatment of the body.
