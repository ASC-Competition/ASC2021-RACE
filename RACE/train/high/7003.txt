He is also a freshman in the arts department of Hubei University.\nLuo Jingyu is from an ordinary family. He said, \"My parents told me if I wanted something I should make an effort to get it, so I earned pocket money by doing housework when I was little.\" The dream of running his own business grew in his heart. He said, \"I want to be a successful person, like Alibaba's Ma Yun.\"\nWhen Luo was a junior student, he had the idea of selling lanterns when he saw many people flying Chinese lanterns in a square. Luo bought some lanterns from a store, but the sales were not as good as he had expected. Then he found another way to do business. He bought lanterns on the Internet at a very low price. Finally he easily made 5,000 yuan in two days.\nWith a happy beginning, Luo planned to open a dress shop. \"My parents didn't support me opening a dress shop, so I had to borrow 120,000 yuan for it.\" Although he did market research before starting, the business wasn't very good because his taste in fashion wasn't accepted by customers. The shop eventually closed down after half a year.\nAfter experiencing a big loss, he decided to do something he was familiar with --- selling painting tools. As a fine arts student, he knew the market. He convinced his friends to invest one million yuan in his shop. With a good business mind and a lot of effort, the sales of the shop reached six million yuan in a year.\nEven though Luo is rich, he uses a cheap cell phone and does not wear luxury  clothes. He has a simple lifestyle. \"It isn't easy to make money, so money should be used on something worthwhile,\" he said.", "id": "high7003.txt"}
