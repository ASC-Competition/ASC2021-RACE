But would you still think it is relaxing if you knew that it damages or destroys your sleep? Scientists say that's exactly what it does.\nIn ancient times, when there were no lamps, telephones or smartphones, the sun was the main source of light. When the sun went down, our brains took that as a signal to start producing melatonin , a chemical that helps us sleep.\nHowever, a healthy amount of melatonin can only be produced in complete darkness.Any light in your bedroom--even the one on the alarm clock or the charging indicator on your cellphone--could disturb the process, not to mention something as bright as smartphone and iPad screens. We tend to hold these much closer than a television or laptop, which allows them to shoot far more light straight into our eyes.\n\"This is particularly worrisome in populations such as young adults and adolescents, who already tend to be _ ,\" said researcher Brittany Wood at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\"Lack of sleep among teens is leading to depression, selfharm, low concentration and poor performance at school,\" she added.\nWhile all lights are the enemy of sleep, not all colors of light have the same effect. Our eyes are particularly sensitive to blue light, which is common during the day. Most of the light coming from electronic screens is blue light and it fools our brain into thinking it's still daytime. By contrast, orange or red light has less influence on melatonin production, because our brains recognize it as a signal that the day is ending, according to The Telegraph.\nAsking yourself to keep your hands off your smartphone before bedtime might seem unreasonable, but you should at least remember to dim the screen or hold it farther away from your eyes. You could also wear a pair of orange sunglasses that take away the harmful blue light.", "id": "high5964.txt"}
