The big envelope meant that the excellent university in Indiana had offered him a place in its Class of 2013. But the $51,300 annual fee is a big trouble. So Mike and his parents are considering offers from several other colleges and are figuring out the costs of tuition, housing and holiday trips home.\nThis year, money is the driving factor  for a growing number of high school seniors, who have to decide what colleges to attend this fall. Less jobs and house prices have changed family spending.\n\"We're excited that Mike got into eight great schools,\" said Mike's father, an engineer at Microsoft. \"But if you consider going to school out of state, you've got to think about all of the other costs: moving, flying back and forth for the holidays.

I'll check and see if there's any way that NYU can offer me any financial aid.\"\nMore than 7.6 million American students have filled out the Free Application for Students Aid, 19.9 percent increase over last year.\nThis month the Federal Department of Education urged college financial aid officers to give more help to certain families.
