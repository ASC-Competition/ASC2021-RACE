If so, is it a big bear? Is it a monkey? Or is it a kind of man?\nNo one knows. This mystery has puzzled the world for years.\nIn 1887, a mountain climber found large footprints in the snow. They looked like the footprints of a very large man. But men don't walk without shoes in the snow!\nIn 1906, other climbers saw more than footprints. Far away they saw a very large animal standing on two legs. As they watched, it ran very quickly.\nFifteen years later, newspapers, had new stories about the \"something\". A mountain climber said he had seen the \"snow man\" walk slowly across the snow, far below him. He said it looked like a very large man.\nFrom then on, more and more people had stories to tell. But not until 1951 did a mountain climber bring back pictures of large footprints. His pictures showed clearly that the snowman walked on two legs, so it was not a bear or a monkey. Could it be an ape man? The mystery grew! And the mystery keeps growing. Some day we may find out just what it is that makes the large footprints.", "id": "high17552.txt"}
