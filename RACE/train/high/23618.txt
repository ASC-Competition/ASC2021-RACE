In October, two students were killed and seven wounded in a shooting at a Mississippi school. Two months later, a 14-year-old boy killed three high school students and wounded five in Dasucah, Kentucky. \nMost of the expulsions, 56 percent, were from high schools, which have students from about age 13. 34 percent were from junior high schools and 9 percent were from elementary schools, the report said.", "id": "high23618.txt"}
