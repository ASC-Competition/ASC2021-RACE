The IMF chief called for a \"broad cooperative approach\" to help handle higher oil and food prices, and said the IMF stood ready to assist countries in need. Strauss-Kahn said the international community would also have to play a role in helping to reduce the effect of commodity price shocks which have caused protests in some countries. European truckers have blockaded major roads to protest fuel prices in recent weeks and food riots   have occurred in Cameroon, Bangladesh, and Somalia among other countries in recent months. \"Poor countries that are highly dependent on food imports are particularly vulnerable   to rising food prices,\" the IMF report said.\nAnti-poverty campaigners are concerned that rising commodity costs could roll back advances made through anti-poverty campaigns in recent years, particularly because poorer families tend to spend much more of their household income on food. The IMF report found that poor households are most affected by food price inflation and \"warned that the share of undernourished people in developing countries could rise rapidly above the current 40 percent of total population\".\n Energy and food values are still rising and the IMF said its research suggests \"the problem is worsening\". The Washington-based fund said it is working closely with its member countries to help reduce inflationary   pressures taking into account countries' specific needs. The report said that global food markets \"need to be kept open\" and that \"restrictive policies\", such as export taxes and bans, should be removed.", "id": "high23732.txt"}
