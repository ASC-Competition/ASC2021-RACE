El Salvador, which was ruined by a Caribbean storm in 1995, was hit by Hurricane Adrian on Friday. This is the first Pacific-born hurricane to ever reach land in this Central American country. \nSome 14,000 people left from the western coast of El Salvador. The storm weakened as it crossed land, heading east. Heavy rains created deadly flooding problems in the hurricane' s wake. \nAdrian is the first Pacific storm of the season. It reported maximum continuous winds of 75 miles per hour, the minimum strength of a hurricane. A Category 3 hurricane, Adrian also caused damage and flooding in Honduras. It is expected to break up before reaching the Caribbean Sea on the eastern coast of Central America. \nHurricane season typically begins June 1 and lasts through November 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted   seven to nine hurricanes for the 2005 season. \n\"It is difficult to make any kind of an exact prediction of how many of these will strike land,\" NOAA administrator Conrad Lautenbacher said. He predicts two to three hurricanes will strike the U.S. this season. \nLast year, six of nine hurricanes reached Category 3 strength or higher. Four of those hit Florida within a six-week period. Altogether, Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne caused more than $40 billion in damage in the Sunshine State. \nThis year' s forecast is based on ocean temperatures. Warmer temperatures produce more tropical storms, which can then turn into hurricanes. \n\"The issue, really, this year is the unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic,\" said Frank Lepore of the National Hurricane Center.", "id": "high20041.txt"}
