Pena ran 10 km daily through the mine's tunnels   to beat the anxiety, wearing cut-down boots until rescuers sent him a pair of sports shoes through a narrow hole that served as the miners' \"lifeline\" to the surface.\n\"When I ran in the darkness, I was running for life,\" Pena told a news conference in New York. \"I was running to show that I wasn't just waiting around. I also wanted God to see that I really wanted to live.\" The miners were discovered alive on August 22---17 days after the mine collapsed, but it took many more days for rescuers to dig a hole big enough to bring them out.\n       The New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, had invited Edison Pena to the event after hearing his story. They thought he could ride in the lead vehicle or hold the finish line tape, but Pena said last week he did not want to watch, he wanted to run. \"I was very eager to take on this big challenge,\" he said. \"I wanted to show the world I could run.\" He hoped to run the 26.2-mile race in about six hours. \"I have a knee injury, but I am eager to cross the finish line,\" he said.       \nAn Elvis Presley fan who asked rescuers to send the singer's music down into the mine, Pena broke into song at the news conference with the Presley hit Return to Sender. \nOn the morning of November 7th, Pena, known as \"the runner\" by fellow miners trapped with him, set out to cover the course along with thousands of other runners and completed the race in five hours and 40 minutes.", "id": "high20344.txt"}
