In any case, I drew pen and ink animals and landscapes much influenced by Krenkel and St. John for five years.\n       For some strange reason, I had been waiting until my retirement to start doing watercolor1s again, but as soon as I walked out of the school door for the last time I picked up my brushes and rediscovered Andrew Wyeth, who quickly became my favorite artist, I had looked through all the art books I had on my shelves and found his watercolor1s to be the closest to how I thought good watercolor1s should look. So I painted landscapes around Minnesota for three years and tried out many other types of painting. However, watercolor1s remained my first choice, and I think I did my best work there, showing my paintings at a number of art exhibitions.\n         Art is now together with my piano playing and reading. There is a time for everything in my world, and it is wonderful to have some time doing what I want to do.
