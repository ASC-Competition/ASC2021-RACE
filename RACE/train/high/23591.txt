Numerous vacations help the couple to maintain their health and emotional well-being-and it's no surprise to health care professionals.\n\"Rest,relaxation, and stress reduction are very important for people's weLl-being and health. This can be accomplished through daily activities,such as exercise and meditation,but vacation is an important part of this as well,\" said primary care physician Natasha Withers from One Medical Group in New York. Withers lists a decreased risk of heart disease and improved reaction time as some of the benefits from taking some time off. \"We also know that the mind is very powerful and can help with healing,so a rested,relaxed mind is able to help the body heal better,\" said Withers.\nPsychologists confirm the value of vacations for the mind. \" The impact that taking a  vacation has on one's mental health is great,\" said Francine Lederer,a clinical psychologist in  Los Angeles who specializes in stress and relationship management. \" Most people have better  life perspective and are more motivated to achieve their goals after a vacation,even if it is a 24-  hour time-out. \" The trips could be good for their health,good for their family and good for their .businesses.\nThe online travel agency Expedia conducted a survey about vacation time in 2010,and  according to their data the average American eamed 18 vacation days-but only used 14 0f  them. France topped the list,with the average worker earning 37 vacation days and using all but  two of them. Americans' responses may not be surprising in a culture where long hours on the  job often are valued,but that's not always good for the individual,the family or the employer.\nPsychologists have also found that people who don't take enough time to relax may find it  harder to relax in the future. \"Without time and opportunity to do this,the nerve connections  that produce feelings of calm and peacefulness become weaker,making it actually more difficult to shift into less-stressed states,\" Mulhern said.", "id": "high23591.txt"}
