What they found was even more unexpected: A deer was taking a bubble bath in their bathtub.\n       \" _ ,\" Mrs. Beck said. \"We were just waking up.\"\n       The deer burst through the front door early on Saturday, ran past the couple's bedroom and into the bathroom. Somehow he managed to turn on the water in the bathtub and knock over a bottle of bubble bath into the bathtub. He then got himself into the bubbly water.\n       \"You could hear the water running over the kicking,\" Beck said.\n       The Becks called State Game Commission officials, who arrived with tranquilizers and a lot of laughter.\n       \"A guy said, 'There's nothing wrong... he's just in there taking a bubble bath,'\" Mrs. Beck said.\n       The animal was soon brought under control, removed from the house and released.\n       \"He was unharmed except for a little cut above the eye,\" said Mrs. Beck. \"We were also fortunate.
