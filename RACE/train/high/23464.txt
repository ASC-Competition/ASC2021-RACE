Here come UFOs!\" At around 8 p.m. July 26,2010, a citizen called Lu Shan spotted this special phenomenon in Leshan, Sichuan: three unidentified  and bright objects appeared in the sky above \"Jade International\" building, and then disappeared all  together after 10 more minutes.\nThe phenomenon caught a lot of attention of some experts and Leshan citizens. On August 3, Professor Wang Sichao from the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences said, the objects still need to be identified. Luckily, Lu Shan took some photos of it. He described, the objects first lit up the sky in the west, but lasted for about 10 minutes. Then they moved slowly at a speed of I meter per minute to the north, and became smaller and smaller until they disappeared. \"It was like a sunset before they faded, and their light also became so gentle as the sunset.\"\nSome citizens doubted they were UFOs, but Lu Shan thought it was possibly caused by the refraction  of the sunlight. However, Lu found no scientific proof to support this special phenomenon after comparing with his photos.\nAccording to Professor Wang Sichao, it could be the \"sun dog \" which is an atmospheric phenomenon that creates bright spots of light in the sky, often in a bright ring or  _ on either side of the sun. But he also added the sky above Leshan city that night did not satisfy the conditions to have \"sun dog\". \"Sun dog\" usually happens in cold areas, such as the north and south poles of the earth. \"So this phenomenon was strange,\" said Wang Sichao. Wang also stated he's only able to confirm the identity of the objects after collecting and analyzing more information and photos snapped  from different locations and then decide on a more scientific explanation.", "id": "high23464.txt"}
