He said, \"Wolfie was more than just a pet to me.\" Wolfie died two years ago, at the age of 15. But long before she and her sister Bubble passed away, Onruang had plans to bring them back to life. Onruang said, \"I buried them at home. Each time I visit them, I say, 'Hi, I'm making a new body for you.'\"\nFinally, Onruang found the South Korean biotechnology company RNL Bio, which can and will clone animals. Onruang collected his dogs' stem cells  , and then he started a website MyFriendAgain.com, so he could earn and save the $310,000 that the cloning would cost.\nThe new dogs should look identical   to Wolfie and Bubble. When the cloning process is done, Onruang may end up with several clones of each dog. But Onruang admits he's still not sure that they will be exactly the same.\nScientists cloned the first animal, a sheep named Dolly, in 1996 in Scotland. That project has raised ethical   questions about where science should draw the line. Another question is whether such technique will lead to a day when humans could be cloned.\n\"If I had an opportunity to clone myself, I would do it readily,\" Onruang said. \"Because it's me, I'm raising myself. I have already known exactly my strengths and weaknesses. This person is going to be the new and improved me, and will live the life I've always wanted to live.\"", "id": "high8587.txt"}
