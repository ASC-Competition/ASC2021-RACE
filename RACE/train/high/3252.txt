Each person's full name will be listed, along with the date and time they entered and left and the name of the person they visited. About 70,000 to 100,000 people visit the White House each month, and the records will include tourists as well as people conducting business.\nThe White House pointed out several exceptions to the policy: \"purely personal guests\" of the Obama family; those cases in which the disclosure  of visitors' names \"would threaten national safety interests\"; and those who come for \"particularly sensitive meetings,\" like candidates for a Supreme Court nomination . Officials said only a \"small number\" will fit in the latter category , and their names would eventually be disclosed after they are no longer secret, like after a nomination is publicly announced. Moreover, they said, the number of undisclosed visitors will be disclosed, to make clear how few they are.", "id": "high3252.txt"}
