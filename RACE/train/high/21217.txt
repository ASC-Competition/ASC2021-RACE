The new regulation by the General Administration of Press and Publication last week banned the use of Chinglish words created by netizens for publishing in the Chinese language.\n\"Geilivable\", combining the pinyin geili(giving strength) with the English suffix   for adjectives, literally means \"giving power\" or \"cool\". Different suffixes( ) and prefixes were then added to the word. \"Hengeilivable\" means \"very cool\", and \"ungeilivable\" means \"dull, not cool at all\".\nCyber language is popular among Chinese netizens, who create Chinglish words to reflect phenomenon in society. One example is \"antizen\", which refers to college graduates who earn a  _ salary and live in small rented apartments, like tiny and laborious ants.\nDavid Tool, a professor with the Beijing International Studies University, said it's very interesting to combine Chinese with English to create new words. \"English is no longer mysterious to the Chinese people. They can use the language in a flexible way according to their own experiences,\" Tool said.\nAt the announcement of the regulation by the General Administration of Press and Publication, netizens expressed their concern. \n\"The administration is totally 'ungeilivable',\" said a netizen named laoda1713. \"I know other netizens will shed tears with me... it is a good chance to enrich our language\".\n\"Language is always developing,\" said a columnist, Wang Pei. \"It needs to be updated to absorb foreign culture and folk wisdom.\"\nBut an unnamed official with the administration said that, in fact, many senior staff from news media who supported the regulation were worried that years later, the younger generation would forget how to use formal Chinese expressions. The official also pointed out that the regulation was only for formal publications in Chinese language, and it only banned Chinglish words in the publication.", "id": "high21217.txt"}
