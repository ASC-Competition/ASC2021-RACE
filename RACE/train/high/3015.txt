It is one of life's frequent affairs: You hand over some money; you might get change; you drive off.\nLate one morning in 1984, headed for lunch in San Francisco, I drove toward a booth. I heard loud music. It sounded like a party. I looked around. No other cars with their windows open. No sound trucks. I looked at the toll booth. Inside it, the man was dancing.\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked.\n\"I'm having a party,\" he said.\n\"What about the rest of the people?\" I looked at the other toll booths.\nHe said, \"What do those look like to you?\" He pointed down the row of toll booths.\n\"They look like......toll booths. What do they look like to you?\"\nHe said, \"Vertical coffins. At 8:30 every morning, live people get in. Then they die for eight hours. At 4:30, like _ from the dead, they reemerge and go home. For eight hours, brain is on hold, dead on the job. Going through the motions.\"\nI was amazed. This guy had developed a philosophy, a mythology about his job.

You're having a good time.\"\nHe looked at me. \"I knew you were going to ask that. I don't understand why anybody would think my job is boring. I have a corner office, glass on all sides. I can see the Golden Gate, San Francisco, and the Berkeley hills. Half the Western world vacations here......and I just stroll in every day and practice dancing.\"", "id": "high3015.txt"}
