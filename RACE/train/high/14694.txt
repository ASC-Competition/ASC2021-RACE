She decided to enter a competition named \"British got Talent\" at the age of 47years. On April 15th 2009, when Susan got up to sing, the audience was shocked by her age and simplicity.\nMiddle-aged women were not the usual type of competitor on the show and the audience was even more surprised when she said before starting to sing that she wanted to become a professional singer. To them she looked well past such possibilities. However, she amazed everybody with her wonderful voice and became an overnight singing star. It was reported that the audience all stood up and clapped warmly and that within 9 days, 100 million people had watched her performances and interviews on the Internet.\nThis was a lot of progress for an unemployed woman who lived along with her cat. Most of her life had been spent looking after her mother who had died aged 92, two years earlier. She had never been married or in her words, \"been kissed\". Susan had learned difficulties and had only once been employed as an assistant cook.\nEven though Susan did not win the \"British got Talent Show\" and came up second, two years later, she already released two successful albums. Many people are touched by her story because Susan Boyle is like each of us in one way or another--full of weakness, often disappointed and _ by others. However, unlike many of us who usually give up too soon, she had the determination to fight for her dream. Susan Boyle launched her successful music career at the age of 48 and you too can still achieve your dream. Just take courage.", "id": "high14694.txt"}
