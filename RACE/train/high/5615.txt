By the time I got outside, he'd broken it. \"Can I take this to school today?\" he asked. With a wave of my hand, I sent him off. I turned my back so he wouldn't see the tears gathering in my eyes.\nThe washing machine had leaked on my brand-new linoleum. If only my husband had just taken the time to fix it the night before when I asked him instead of playing checkers with Jonathan.\nIt was days like this that made me want to quit. I just wanted to drive up to the mountains, hide in a cave, and never come out.\nSomehow I spent most of the day washing and drying clothes and thinking how love had disappeared from my life. As I finished hanging up the last of my husband's shirts, I looked at the clock. 2:30. I was late. Jonathan's class let out at 2:15 and I hurriedly drove to the school.\nI was out of breath by the time I knocked on the teacher's door and peered through the glass. She rustled through the door and took me aside. \"I want to talk to you about Jonathan,\" she said.\nI prepared myself for the worst. Nothing would have surprised me. \"Did you know Jonathan brought flowers to school today?\" she asked. I nodded, thinking about my favorite bush and trying to hide the hurt in my eyes. \"Let me tell you about yesterday,\" the teacher insisted. \"See that little girl?\" I watched the bright-eyed child laugh and point to a colorful picture taped to the wall. I nodded.\n\"Well, yesterday she was almost hysterical. Her mother and father are going through a nasty divorce. She told me she didn't want to live, she wished she could die. I watched that little girl bury her face in her hands and say loud enough for the class to hear, 'Nobody loves me.' I did all I could to comfort her, but it only seemed to make matters worse.\" \"I thought you wanted to talk to me about Jonathan,\" I said.\n\"I do,\" she said, touching the sleeve of my blouse. \"Today your son walked straight over to that child. I watched him hand her some pretty pink flowers and whisper, 'I love you.'\"\nI felt my heart swell with pride for what my son had done. I smiled at the teacher. \"Thank you,\" I said, reaching for Jonathan's hand, \"you've made my day.\"\nLater that evening, I began pulling weeds from around my azalea bush. As my mind wandered back to the love Jonathan showed the little girl, a biblical verse came to me: \"...these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.\" While my son had put love into practice, I had only felt anger.\nI heard the familiar squeak of my husband's brakes as he pulled into the drive. I snapped a small limb bristling with hot pink azaleas off the bush. I felt the seed of love that God planted in my family beginning to bloom once again in me. My husband's eyes widened in surprise as I handed him the flowers. \"I love you,\" I said.", "id": "high5615.txt"}
