Is he satisfied because he has a lot of money, or does he have a lot of money because he chooses to be satisfied?\n _ So is enoughness something that happens to us when we reach a certain level, or is it an experience we can choose and celebrate at any time?\nMy friends Adrian and Carey live in a humble cottage in the rainforest. They have quite a modest income, no telephone, and they walk around naked most of the time. I think they are the happiest people I know. They wake up with the sun, love each other very much, and welcome guests with a full and open heart.
