Many proverbs give advice on how to live. Some proverbs are hundreds of years old, but they are still used today.\nFor example, my son is just like his father in many ways. We often say the two of them prove the proverb that the apple does not fall far from the tree.\nMy daughter is very short. She would like to be taller. But I tell her that good things come \nin small packages. Some valuable things are very small, like diamonds and other jewels. But I also tell my children that all that glitters is not gold. Something may look valuable, but may not really be valuable. Also, I tell them do not judge a book by its cover. You should not judge something only by its appearance.\nSometimes I tell my children to cooperate to solve a problem. After all, two heads are better than one. But another proverb says too many cooks spoil the soup. If too many people try to do something, then the job will not be done well.\nI also tell my children that two wrongs do not make a right. You should not do something bad just because someone did the same to you.\nSome people are pessimists while other people are optimists. Pessimists always think about \nhow bad things are or will be; optimists might say that every cloud has a silver lining and they always look on the bright side. Other people are both pessimists and optimists. They hope for the best and prepare for the worst.\nSome people often worry about what they will do in a situation that might happen in the future. We could tell them do not cross that bridge until you come to it.\nIt is usually much better to prevent a problem from happening than it is to find ways to solve it.So we say an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.", "id": "high18279.txt"}
