Once he settles in and realizes his natural football ability, tragedy strikes again and he loses his leg to a deadly bone cancer. Unstoppable follows Harrison's incredible journey as he faces many challenges in his life.\nTim Green says he decided to write a novel about a kid facing cancer after watching how his wife fought to survive her own illness. \"Her mental and physical toughness were more heroic to me than anything I'd ever seen in the national sports leagues,\" Green told TFK Kid Reporter Zachary J. Lewis.\nAfter watching his wife's battle, Green said, he knew he needed to write about a person who struggled through a serious illness.

Cancer-survivor Jeffrey Keith lost his leg to disease at age twelve, but went on to be the goalie  for the Boston College Division 1 Lacrosse Team and was also the first _ to run 3,300 miles across the country. When Green heard Jeffrey Keith's story, he knew it was the perfect narrative on which to base his next book.\nTFK asked Keith what it felt like to read Unstoppable for the first time. \"Tim captured what it felt like for me to go through this experience and battle back,\" Keith said. \"After I read the book, Tim asked me to describe it in one word, and I said 'awesome'.
