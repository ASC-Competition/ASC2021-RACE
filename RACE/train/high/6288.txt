We met in night school. After Jennie and I had completed the required courses, we started teaching in the same school. For a time we were just casual friends, but one day, when I was telling Jennie about my problem son, we discovered we were kindred   spirits. \"He's a difficult little character,\" I explained. Jennie looked thoughtful. \"Maybe you're only seeing him with your eyes.\" She was silent for a moment and then added softly, \"It is only with the heart that one sees rightly.\" I stared at her. \"You're quoting   that! It's from The Little Prince, Saint-Exupery's book for children, one of my favorites. You know it, too?\" Jennie nodded. \"I love it. I've read it so often. I've practically memorized it.\"\nNow, when I think of Jennie, I recall that book because Jennie --more than anyone I know --possessed the gift of seeing with the heart.\nFrom that moment of a treasured book shared, our friendship grew steadily. It wasn't that I didn't have an excellent relationship with my husband and son, but my mother had died shortly after my marriage, and I had neither sisters nor daughters. I realize, now, how I needed someone to share those little, seemingly unimportant things that add so much to life --things that must be shared to be fully appreciated.\nAnd it was Jennie who helped me with my fourth-grade problem child. One day I was at my wit's end. \"What he needs is a good beating!\" I exploded.\n\"He's probably had plenty of those,\" Jennie said. \"Maybe he just needs sincere praise for anything he does right, and a hug or two each day.\" I followed this suggestion, and eventually, because of Jennie, I discovered a lovable little boy.\nLooking back, I have to admit that she taught me so much. The days I spent with her has become one of my happiest memories.", "id": "high6288.txt"}
