After they were seated, the mother spotted a friend in the audience and walked down the aisle to greet her. Seizing the opportunity to explore the wonders of the concert hall, the little boy rose and eventually found his way through a door marked \"NO ADMITTANCE.\" When the house lights dimmed and the concert was about to begin, the mother returned to her seat and discovered that the child was missing.\nSuddenly, the curtains parted and spotlights focused on the impressive Steinway on stage. To her horror, the mother saw her little boy sitting at the keyboard, innocently picking outTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star.\nAt that moment, the great pianist made his entrance, quickly moved to the piano, and whispered in the boy's ear, \"Don't quit. Keep playing.\" Then leaning over, Paderewski reached down with his left hand and began filling in a bass part. Soon his right arm reached around to the other side of the child and he added a melody. Together, the old master and the young beginner transformed a frightening situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was amazed and, as it finished, they cheered.\nThat's the way it is in life. What we can accomplish on our own is hardly noteworthy. We try our best, but the results aren't exactly graceful flowing music. But when we put our trust in the hands of a Greater Power, our life's work can be truly beautiful. Next time you set out to accomplish great feats, listen carefully. You can hear the voice of the Master, whispering in your ear, \"Don't quit, and keep playing.\"", "id": "high317.txt"}
