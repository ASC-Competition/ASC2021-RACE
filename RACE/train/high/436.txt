How can you sleep?\" a friend asks, horrified. I tell her my family has decided to shut the air conditioner off and reduce our electric bill. On this first night of our cost-cutting plan, it's only 85 degrees. We're going to suffer, but the three kids complain anyway.\nThey have grown up in 72-degree comfort, protected from the world outside.\n\"It's too hot to sleep,\" my 13-year-old daughter complains. \"I'm about to die from this heat,\" her brother complains down the hall. \"Just try it tonight,\" I tell them. In truth I'm too tired to turn for long. My face is sweaty, but I lie quietly listening to the cricket choirs outside that remind me of childhood.\nThe neighbor's dog howls. Probably a passing squirrel. It's been years since I took the time to really listen to the night.\nI think about grandma, who lived to 92 and still helped with my mom's gardening until just a few weeks before she died. And then, I'm back there at her house in the summer heat of my childhood. I move my pillow to the foot of grandma's bed and turn my face toward the open window. I turn the pillow, hunting for the cooler side.\nGrandma saw me turn over and over. \"If you just watch for the breeze ,\" she said, \"you'll cool off and fall asleep.\" I stare at the filmy white curtain, willing it to move. Lying still, waiting, I suddenly notice the life outside the window. The bug chorus. Neighbors, porch -sitting late, speak in unclear words that calm me.\n\"Mom, did you hear that?\" my seven-year-old son cries, \"I think it was an owl family.\"\n\"Probably,\" I tell him, \"just keep listening...\"\nWithout the working air conditioner, the house is peaceful, and the natural night noises seem close enough to touch. I hope I'm awake tonight when the first breeze comes in.", "id": "high436.txt"}
