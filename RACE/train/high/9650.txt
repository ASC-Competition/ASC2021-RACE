You walk between the shelves. You carry a shopping basket and your food is in it.\nYou probably hear soft, slow music as you walk between the shelves. If you hear fast music, you walk quickly. The supermarket plays slow music. You walk slowly and have more time to buy things.\nMaybe you go to the meat department first. There is some meat on sale, and you want to find it. The manager of the supermarket knows where customers enter the meat department. The cheaper meat is at the other end of the meat department, away from where the customers enter. You have to walk by all the expensive meat before you find the cheaper meat. Maybe you will buy some of the expensive meat instead of the meat on sale.\nThe department selling milk and milk products such as butter and milk powder is called the dairy department. Many customers like milk that has only a little butterfat in it. One store has three different jars of low fat milk. One says\"1 percent fat\"on the jar. The second says \"99 percent fat free\". The third says \"LOW FAT\" in big letters and\"1%\"in small letters. As you can see, all the milk has the same amount of fat. The milk is all the same. However,in this store the three jars of milk cost three different amounts of money. Maybe the customers will buy the milk that costs the most.\nMost of the food in supermarkets is very pleasing. It all says \"Buy me!\" to the customers. The expensive meat says \"Buy me!\"as you walk by. The expensive milk jar says \"Buy me! I have less fat.\"", "id": "high9650.txt"}
