Farmers say scientists advised them to mix pesticides with a sugary syrup   to control pests, and they found the mixture cheaper and more effective than pure chemicals---- although soft drink makers and scientists dismissed the claims. \nN. Hamunayya, who has become famous in his village in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh, said his crop survived an attack of pests which had resisted other solutions. \"We found that all the colas had the same effect on pests. The pests became numb and fell to ground,\" he said.He said the drinks had all the elements they needed: they were cheaper, sticky, fizzy, and attracted ants, which swallowed the larvae( )of the pests. \nBut Thirupathi Reddy, assistant director of the Regional Agri Research station, Guntur, says tests had denied such claims. \" We conducted some field trials on cotton crop at our research station. There were no increases of productivity or deaths of pests,\" he says. Statements from Pepsi and Coca-Cola said there was \" no scientific basis\" for this practice. But their sellers are enjoying booming sales. Mantan Wali, who sells soft drinks in 17 villages in the region, said sales increased , thanks to the farmers. \" For the 10 days between August and September I had booming business. Instead of just 30 cases ( each containing a dozen one-litre bottles) of cola I started selling almost 200 cases, \" he said. \" We expected the sales to fall suddenly  after the argument over pesticide remains in the cola drinks. Now I have to keep extra stock  for the cotton farmers, \" he said.", "id": "high23909.txt"}
