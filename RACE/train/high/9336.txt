A recent survey shows that 90% of surgeons in the UK put music on the sound system in the _ during operations. Plastic surgeons play the most music; it appears that ear, nose, and throat specialists the least.\nBut it isn't only in surgeries  where music is popular. In another recent survey, one-third of the 1,613 people said they listen to music while working. And 79% of them said that humming along improves their job satisfaction or productivity.\nIs listening to music at work a good idea? Yes, say the experts. Many surgeons say that music helps to create a \"calm atmosphere\", and a third of them added that it avoids getting bored! Also, listening to music raises the levels of a brain chemical that can help people focus. Office workers say it improves job satisfaction. Several studies suggest that it's also good for hospital patients. Those listening to music through headphones during surgery require less anesthetic , up to 50% less in some cases, and recover more quickly afterwards. \"Sure, music reduces anxiety before surgery,\" says Zeev Kain, an anesthetist at Yale University.\nSo, what type of music should we be listening to? Surgeons from the previous survey preferred rock, pop music and classical. And hip-hop is popular too. However, whatever the kind, it appears that self-selected music is the best choice. Pennsylvania State University research showed that when people chose their own music there was more stress reduction . And other researchers found that when listening to self-selected music, surgeons did the maths faster and more accurately than when they were listening to music chosen for them.", "id": "high9336.txt"}
