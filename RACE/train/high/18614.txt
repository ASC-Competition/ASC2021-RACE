John was difficult to control and he nearly drove me crazy. While talking about him one day, an old teacher put his hand on my shoulder and said, \"There will always be a John. Your job is to learn to discover what makes him different and help him succeed.\" The next year, there was indeed another John.  But that advice taught me that there is something to appreciate in everyone.\n\"An Early Key Lesson\" By Elaine West\nBefore I began my first teaching job, my mother, a teacher of 30 years, gave me a very special gift, five simple words that have had an effect on my entire life. \"Make friends with the janitor  .\" Her wisdom taught me the respect for all types of characters and continues to enrich my life to this day. Just five little words but what an impact they can have when you take them to heart.\n\"Raising Mommy\" By Jan Davis\nBeing a mother can always present challenges and rewards. Someone told me early that children will teach you everything you need to know. Being a mother is being raised. Our children become our advisers. Their dreams become our professors, as we are taking notes carefully. The sounds of their laughter and smiles are a great reward to us. Their tears remind us that it is okey to fail, and that we should wipe the tears away and try again.", "id": "high18614.txt"}
