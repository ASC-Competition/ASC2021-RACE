For example, we've secured internships   with world-famous firms such as Honda.\n\"At a time of funding cutbacks where schools are finding it more and more difficult to offer this kind of mentoring, it is extremely important that these opportunities are available both to help youth with their school work and grades and to give them opportunities which may help shape their futures. \" Kieran Hepburn, 14, is one of a group of Banbury youth who has benefited from the program so far. In October the Banbury School pupil was accompanied by Young Inspirations staff to Paris where he was an observer at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) International Youth Forum  .\nThe event was held for young people from around the world, to seek their views on how the future of youth and education should look. Kieran joined several hundred observers mostly in their 20s and was the only UK school pupil to attend the event. Kieran thinks the trip was a life changing experience. \" Before we left I didn't quite know what to make of it but when we got there we didn't stop, it was amazing,\" he said, \" We went to three or four hours of debates each day and then did something cultural each afternoon. \"\nThe main theme of the forum was how youth can drive change in political and public life. It dealt with issues   such as drug abuse, violence and unemployment.\nKieran said: \" It has really helped me to improve my confidence and social skills as well as my school grades and I was voted most improved pupil at school in August. \"\nThe Young Inspirations mentoring sessions take place each Friday in Banbury.
