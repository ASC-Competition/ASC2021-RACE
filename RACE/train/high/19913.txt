His work helped inspire the creation of the personal computer and the Internet.\nArtificial Intelligence\nBefore Minsky, computers were more like calculators, performing math operations at speeds much faster than humans. Minsky was the first to say that computers can one day be as intelligent as human beings. He was so convinced about this, that in 1959, he and his friend John McCarthy invented the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nMinsky wrote a book called Perceptrons, describing a particular type of \"artificial neural  network\". Neural networks have made a comeback in a new field of Computer Science called Deep Learning. Deep Learning is used to recognize things and people in pictures (as seen in Facebook and Google Photos), language translation( try Google Translate sometimes), and so on.\nRobotics, Microscopes and Virtual Reality\nHow many of you have done Robotics at school and loved it? You have Minsky to thank again, for his work on Robotics. One of his biggest inventions was the confocal scanning microscope, an instrument that is still widely used today in medical and scientific research.\nMinsky was really futuristic. He created one of the first head-mounted graphics displays , which gave rise to the exciting area of Virtual Reality. This year, Facebook is releasing Oculus, a virtual reality headset, which you can use to play games with your friends in a 3-D environment.\nMinsky's major prediction that computers will one day become as intelligent as humans is now called the Theory of Singularity.", "id": "high19913.txt"}
