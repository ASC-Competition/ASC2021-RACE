A 2001 Gallup Poll found that 45 percent of Americans agree with the statement \"God created the human being pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so \", while 37 percent preferred a mixed belief that \"Human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God guided this process\", and only 12percent accepted the standard scientific theory that \"Human being have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process\".\nThere are at least four reasons to make people resistant to accepting evolution.\n1. The warfare model of science and religion. The belief that there is a war between science and religion where one is right and the other is wrong, and that one must choose one over the other.\n2. The belief that evolution is a threat to specific religious tenets . Many people attempt to use science to prove certain religious tenets, but when they do not appear to fit, the science is rejected.\n3. Misunderstanding of evolutionary theory. A significant problem is that most people know so little about the theory. In the 2001 Gallup Poll, for example, a quarter of the people surveyed said they didn't know enough to say whether they accepted evolution or not, and only 34 percent considered themselves to be \"very informed \" about the theory.\n4. The fear that evolution degrades our humanity. Darwin revealed us to be \"mere animals\", subject to the same natural laws and historical forces as all other animals.\nBelievers should embrace science, especially evolutionary theory, for what it has done to uncover the magnificence of the divinity  in a depth never dreamed by our ancient ancestors. We have learned a lot in 4,000 years, and that knowledge should never be denied. Instead, science should be welcomed by all who cherish human understanding and wisdom.", "id": "high8268.txt"}
