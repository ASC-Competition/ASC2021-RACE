In other words lots of English people like the idea of sport. A lot watch sport on TV. But the number who take part in sport is quite small. On the whole English people prefer to be fat rather than thin.\nThe most popular sport in England is football. Football is played on Saturday afternoon in most towns and the supporters of a certain team will travel from one end of the country to the other to see their team play. There are four divisions of the football league.Not surprisingly the best teams are in the first division. But the best supporters are often in the fourth division. You have to be a good supporter to watch the fourth division football!\nMany other sports are also played in England, such as golf, in which you try to knock a ball into a hole; basketball, in which you try to got a ball through a net ; tennis, in which you try to hit a ball so that your opponent can not hit it. As you see, if the ball had not been invented, there would have been no sport.\nActually , that is not quite true. Athletics isn't played with a ball; nor horseracing . Perhaps that is why they are not so popular as football!", "id": "high58.txt"}
