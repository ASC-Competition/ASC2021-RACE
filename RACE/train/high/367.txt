The views invite a long look from a comfortable chair in front of the wooden house.\nEvery window in our wooden house has a view, and the forest and lakes seldom look the same as the hour before. Each look reminds us where we are.\nThere is space for our three boys to play outside, to shoot arrows, collect tree seeds, build earth houses and climb trees.\nOur kids have learned the names of the trees, and with the names have come familiarity and appreciation. As they tell all who show even a passing interest, maple makes the best fighting sticks and white pines are the best climbing trees.\nThe air is clean and fresh.

Though they have one glass a day of juice and the rest is water, they never say anything against that.\n _ We watch the maples turn every shade of yellow and red in the fall and note the poplars' putting out the first green leaves of spring.
