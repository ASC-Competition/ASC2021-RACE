Your book, Out of My Mind, filled me with those sparks. I enjoyed getting to know Melody. Despite the fact that she had cerebral palsy ,Melody had an amazing character that shone brightly. Out of My Mind helped me learn a life-long lesson.\nYour book has changed my point of view. I never teased those who had special needs, but I never really felt comfortable around them either. When I started reading your novel, I saw how Melody was a smart and talented girl. At the beginning of the book, I asked myself, \"Would I be Melody's friend?\" The voice in my stomach told me the sad truth: no. I carried on with your book from start to finish, and when I closed it, I asked myself the same question, \"Would I be Melody's friend?\" I realized, with a smile, that the answer was right in front of me. Throughout Out of My Mind, I had become Melody's friend.\nLast year, there was a boy in my class who had Asperger's syndrome . I didn't really know him; he just seemed different to me. This was around the time that I read your novel. Melody showed me how she was just as good as anyone else in her classroom and how the same goes for anyone else with disabilities. The boy in my class amazed me by what he was capable of doing. As the days went by, I started helping him instead of avoiding him.\nMelody opened my eyes and cleared the world around me. She showed me how a girl with cerebral palsy was the same as a girl like me. Now it is time for me to thank you for writing this amazing novel. I will never forget your fantastic book.\nSincerely,\nMargaret  Lim", "id": "high10313.txt"}
