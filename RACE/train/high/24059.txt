It was warm with a tiny wind, the sun streamed through lightweight sweaters to warm the skin; the male choir   was warming up, and the students were moving around the lawn   behind the huge crowd of six-thousand-plus observers.\nWith all of the parents, sisters, brothers, grandparents, aunts and uncles, the state university was a center of activity. My nephew was going to receive his bachelor's degree. Who would have guessed that four years would go by so quickly?\nAs the crowd of freshly polished candidates wandered, joked, hugged and chatted behind the bleachers , I heard several cell phones ring. There were several casual conversations going on with the accompanying giggles   of the not-quite-mature students, but then one conversation in particular caught my attention:\n\"Yes, Grandma, I'm really graduating. I can't believe it, either! I never thought I'd be here today, you know? Really! Like, I know it! Yes, it's a very special day. Oh, what did the doctor say? He did? I know, Gran... I know you wanted to come... It's okay... No, really, please don't cry...It's a very happy day, you know?\n\"Hold on, we're lining up okay, all set... yes, the center aisle  ... the grass is awesome! Smells really good, too... Oh wow, they've got like a million balloons they're going to release! Yes, Kelly's here... Okay, I'll give her your love... here we go! Gran, I'm graduating!\n\"Love you, too, Gran. I'm so glad you could be here with me!\"\nAnd somehow, my initial  dislike at the use of cell phones and the casual conservations during such a serious occasion left me. For these little representatives of modern technology had joined a young woman and her fond Gran to share a very special moment in time.", "id": "high24059.txt"}
