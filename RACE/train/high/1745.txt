The makers of the movie Pearl Harbor have behaved differently.\nThe noise about Pearl Harbor, made by Disney,has reached its highest point with its premiere   before the movie opens in cinemas across the US at the start of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, a time to recall national heroes who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield.\nAs Ben Affleck is the main star, the movie seems sure to become a success in the United States at least.\nAt almost three hours in length, it promises to be a good old Hollywood movie. There is a love story. Affleck and his co-star, Josh Hartnett, both fall in love with the navy nurse, Kate Beckinsale and, of course, there is much human courage and love of country.\nIt's certain that Disney will be accused of \"changing\" history. The showing of actual events in a movie always causes arguments.\nBits of the story are deliberately not mentioned in the movie. It does not address the theory held by some historians that President Franklin Roosevelt knew about Japan's intention to attack the ships in Pearl Harbor.It is said he did nothing, as he was aware that such a blow would allow him to take America into the Second World War.\nJapan remains sensitive about being accused of wartime atrocities  . And Disney is sensitive about its business in Japan, where it has a theme park.\nNot all the reviews of the movie have been full of praise. A reviewer for Newsweek, who was given an early preview, acknowledged that the 40-minute sequence   showing the attack itself was powerful. The attack comes quite late in the movie, however, and the reviewer was less impressed with the characters and the love story.\n\"Almost every line of the dialogue sounds like it comes from an old movie, \" the reviewer wrote.", "id": "high1745.txt"}
