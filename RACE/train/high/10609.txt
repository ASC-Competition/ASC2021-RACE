Yet the cheerful and positive 60 year old is not only refusing to let her disability get her down ---- she is also planning to cross the length of Britain in a power wheelchair.\nGetting ready for the trip is not easy. She has already run into many problems - not least officials and organizations who view her as a health and safety risk. One police officer wrote to Mary requesting:\n1. The proposed route through our area with road numbers.\n2. The dates and times each day that this will be taking place.\n3. The location details of the proposed overnight stops.\n4. The names and mobile phone contact details of the Support Crew.\nAnother police officer asked her to travel off road!
