It improves with practice. If you want to meet people and make friends, you must be willing to take some action. You must first go where there are people. You won't make friends staying home alone.\nJoining a club or a group, talking with those who like the same things as you do is much easier. Or join someone in some activity.\nMany people are nervous when talking to new people. After all meeting strangers means facing the unknown. And it's human nature to feel a bit uncomfortable about unknown. Most of our fears about dealing with new people comes from doubts about ourselves. We imagine other people are judging us, finding us too tall or too short, too this or too that. But don't forget that they must be feeling the same way. Try to accept yourself as you are, and try to put the other person at ease. You'll both feel more comfortable.\nTry to act self-confident even if you don't feel that way. When you enter a room full of strangers, such as a new classroom, walk tall and straight, look directly at other people and smile.\nIf you see someone you'd like to speak to, say something. Don't wait for the other person to start a conversation.\nJust meeting someone new does not mean that you will make friends with that person--friendship is based on mutual liking and \"give and take\". It takes time and effort to develop.", "id": "high3319.txt"}
