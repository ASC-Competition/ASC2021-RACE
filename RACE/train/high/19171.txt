When I was a child, I enjoyed drawing, but I also liked making things out of clay . I won a prize for one of my paintings when I was fourteen. That may be why I went to art school four years later. But I studied painting at first, not pottery . I like being a potter because I like to work with my hands and feel the clay. I'm happy working by myself and being near my home. I don't like mass-produced things, because they are made by machines. I think crafts  are very important and crafts-people make things cleverly with hands. They make our lives color1ful. When I left school, I got some money. I hope to become a full-time crafts-woman. This work-place is small, but I wish to move to a larger one next year.", "id": "high19171.txt"}
