Confirmation through DNA testing had not been attempted.\nZhang Chengmao, Shen's lawyer, said yesterday he would seek State compensation \"but we have not reached a figure yet\".\nWhen asked about compensation, Shen said, \"My mother, who died from the stress of continually appealing, cannot be bought. Eleven years of freedom cannot be bought. Schooling of my daughter that was stopped because of poverty cannot be bought.\"\nAs for his wife, the man said he did not hate her at all. \"If she had not reappeared, maybe I would have been wronged for life,\" he said.\nHe also said he did not plan to sue Zhang for bigamy, though she had remarried in Shandong Province without divorcing him.", "id": "high7795.txt"}
