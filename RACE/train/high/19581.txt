Singer, born in Philadelphia, has lived in France for more than 40 years.\n\"Although things have changed greatly in the past 20 years when it comes to food in the country,\"he says,\"and what was a big affair with eating has been slowly softened up, there are still events in the year, like birthdays and New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve that are still really anchored in traditional food and cooking. But it's not every day.\"\nSome people think French food life may be a performance, adds Jennifer Berg, director of graduate food studies at New York University.\"They want to believe that France is this nation where people are spending five hours a day going to 12 different markets to get their food. The reality is most croissants are factory-made, and most people are buying convenience food, except for the very small group of people in high society. But part of our identity relies on believing that myth.\"\nIn Italy, as in France, takeout is still  ly rare.\"Eating fast is not at all part of our culture,\"says Marco Bolasco, editorial director of Slow Food and an Italian food expert. Our meals are relaxed, even during a lunch break. Food in Italy is love, and nutrition, and pleasure, he says. An Italian child's first experience with food is not small round cakes or rice or eggs, but probably ice cream, notes Bolasco. Status and wealth play less of a role in food.", "id": "high19581.txt"}
