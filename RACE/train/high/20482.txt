Your whole body feels tight. The slightest move makes you jump with pain.Nothing could be worse than a pain in the neck. That is why we use the phrase to describe some people who give you the same feeling. We have all met such people. \nOne is the man who always seems to be clapping his hands--often at the wrong time--during a performance in the theater. He keeps you from hearing the actors. \nEven worse are those who can never arrive before the curtain goes up and the play begins. They come hurrying down to your row of seats. You are comfortably settled down, with your hat and heavy coat in your lap. You must stand up to let them pass. You are proud of your self-control after they have settled into their seats... Well, what now... Good God, one of them is up again.He forgot to go to the men's room, and once more you have to stand up, hanging on to your hat and coat to let him pass. Now, that is \"a pain in the neck\".\nAnother, well-known to us all, is the person sitting behind you in the movies. His mouth is full of popcorn; he is chewing loudly, or talking between bites to friends next to him. None of them remain still. Up and down, back and forth, they go for another bag of popcorn, or something to drink.\nThen, there is the man sitting next to you at a lunch counter smoking a smelly cigar.He wants you to enjoy it too, and blows smoke across your food into your mouth. \nWe must not forget the man who comes into a bus or subway car and sits down next to you, just as closes you will let him. You are reading the newspaper and he leans over and stretches his neck so that he can read the paper with you. He may even turn the paper to the next page before you are ready for it.\nWe also call such a person a \"rubber-neck\", always stretching his neck to where it does not belong, like neighbors who watch all your visitors. They enjoy invading your privacy. People have a strong dislike for rubber-necks. They hate being spied upon.", "id": "high20482.txt"}
