He made it just the right size to fill the space between the two windows. When I got home that evening, John was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill for the job.\n   My wife said to me quietly, \"It's his ninth cup of tea today.\" But she said in a loud voice, \"It is a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?\"\n  \"I will decide about that when I see the bill, \" I read:\n  One dining table, 10 November, 1989.\n  Cost of wood: $17.00\n  Paint: $1.50\n  Work: 8 hours ($1 an hour) $8.00\n  Total: $36.50\nWhen I was looking at the bill, John said, \"It's been a fine day, hasn't it? Quite sunny.\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"I'm glad it is only the 10thof November.\"\n  \"Me, too,\" said John. \"You wait. It'll be a lot colder by the end of the month.\"\n  \"Yes, colder.... And more expensive! Dining tables will be $20 more expensive on November 30th, won't they, John?\" John looked hard at me for half a minute. Was there a little smile in his two blue eyes? I gave his bill back to him.\n  \"If it isn't too much trouble, John,\" I said, \"Please add it up again and you can forget the date.\"\n  I paid him $26.50and he was happy to get it.", "id": "high20922.txt"}
