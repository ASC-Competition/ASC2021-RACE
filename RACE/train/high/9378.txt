They're doing it so their kids can see what life was like before technology like iPads, computers and even coffee machines was part of everyday life.\nThey have stopped using all technology from their home and are relying on the things people would have used back in the 80s. There is a box at the front door where people can put their cell phones in, while they're visiting the family.\nBlair McMillan and his wife Morgan want their kids--Trey, 5, and Denton, 2--to have a year without technology.\nInstead of reading e-readers, they are reading books. Instead of using a GPS, they used paper maps. The home the family is living in was built in the 1980s. Even the way they dress and style their hair is from the 80s.\nThe whole idea started when young Trey was called to come outside. He didn't because he was busy playing on the ipad. That's why his dad thought of the idea of living \"in 1982\" for a year. The family plans to live like \"it's 1982\" until April next year.
