But now, Nepal-born Indra Tamang is the owner of two multi-million dollar apartments in the same building.\nThe former owner - his former employer, Ruth Ford - died last year and left the apartments  to Mr Tamang in her will.\nMr Tamang is happy but quickly points out that his good fortune did not come easily. \"I am happy and have been touched by the generosity of the Ford family,\" he says. \"I never expected that I will be given the ownership of these apartments. But I have been working for the family for the last 36 years, devotedly, with honesty and dedication . So my hard work has been rewarded.\"\nMr Tamang was 21 when he was brought from Nepal by Charles Ford, a writer and a photographer. Mr Ford died in 2002; his sister, actress Ruth Ford, then took charge and told Mr Tamang that he was like a brother to her after Charles's death.\nMrs Ford died aged 98. During the last five years of her life, she lost her eyesight and also developed speech problems. Mr Tamang looked after her most of the time and took care of her medicines and food.\nHe also worked with Charles Ford on various photography projects, which he now wants to keep as the photographer's legacy . He hopes to organize exhibitions of Mr Ford's photographs and edit a book of his works.\nMr Tamang plans to sell the bigger, three-bedroom apartment to pay the taxes he owes to the government on his legacy. He says: \"The rules of the building might be a problem, as they require a minimum monthly income to qualify to live as owner of apartments. I have my small house here but I am happy with it,\"\nMr Tamang has learnt his lesson from the life of his employers and plans to use his money with great caution. \"I think one should save money for old age. That's when you need it the most to get care,\" he says.", "id": "high4362.txt"}
