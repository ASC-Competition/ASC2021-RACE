Please remember, for often, achieving what you set out to do is not the most important thing.\nA boy decided to dig a deep hole behind his house. As he was working, a couple of older boys stopped by to watch. \"What are you doing?\" asked one of the visitors. \"I want to dig a hole all the way through the earth!\" the boy answered excitedly. The older boys began to laugh, telling him that digging a hole all the way through the earth was impossible. After a while, the boy picked up a jar. He showed it to the visitors. It was full of all kinds of stones and insects. Then he said calmly and confidently, \"Maybe I can't finish digging all the way through the earth, but look at what I've found during this period!\"\nThe boy's goal was far too difficult, but it did cause him to go on.

It is the unexpected joy on the journey that really makes sense.", "id": "high296.txt"}
