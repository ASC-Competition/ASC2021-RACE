What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!\" he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7 - foot grizzly charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing. He ran even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pumping frantically and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him.\nAt that instant the atheist cried out \"Oh my God!\"\nTime stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving.\nAs a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky,\" You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don't exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic  accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this difficulty? Am I to count you as a believer?\"\nThe atheist looked directly into the light. \"It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?\"\"Very well,\" said the voice.\nThe light went out. The river ran again. And the sounds of the forest resumed.\nAnd then the bear dropped his right paw... brought both paws together... bowed his head and spoke, \"Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful.\"", "id": "high5462.txt"}
