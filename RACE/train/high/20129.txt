The description said there was a tear on the cover of the book. I was pleased that it was just a small tear and otherwise the book was in very good condition. This seller was honest and did not try to overplay the condition in order to make a sale.\nSome good information  Feb 06, 2010\nThis book does have some good information, but it does not talk at all about eating organic food, grass fed beef, free-range eggs, etc. The poisonous pesticides   and artificial hormones   in our society have a huge effect on our health and some illnesses probably wouldn't even exist if it weren't for them.\nFantastic  Aug 05, 2009\nThis book is perfect for any questions you have about using food to help your body.
