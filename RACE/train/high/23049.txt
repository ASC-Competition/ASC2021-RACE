I thought 1 was finished,\"he said,\"Then I realized 1 was still there--the jolt hadn't knocked me off.My body and legs were all right,but my arms  were paralyzed from the shoulder down.''Fortunately Ossinger was able to continue down and soon the feeling began to return to his shoulders,upper arms,and,two hours later,his fingertips.Ossinger was a lucky man.\nA single stroke of lightning,which is usually three to four miles long,travels at speeds of up to 100,000 miles per second.In a single flash,it can carry 100 million volts of electricity and reach a temperature of 55,000 degrees Fahrenheit,five times hotter than the surface of the sun.During its brief life span,lightning carries enough energy to power  a 100-watt light bulb for as long as three months.If you find yourself unlucky enough to be  near lightning's path,you could suffer a direct hit,sending electrical current though your body for some 5 00 milli-seconds.Because of the short duration,severe burns aren't common and the resulting burns are usually superficial .\nAccording to the national Weather Service,more people have been killed by lightning in the United States during the past 30 years,an average of 87 a year-than by either tornadoes or hurricanes,484 people were injured in 1994 alone.These\"swords from the sky\" are also responsible for an estimated$100 million to$300 million of property damage a year.During the 1980s an average of 5502 wildfires a year were sparked by lightning on national forest lands alone.\nEarth is struck by at 1east 100 of these flashes every second-more than 8.6 million strikes a day.For all its destructive power,lightning has its good sides too.It's likely that humans discovered fire from some early lightning-sparked flames.And all that activity above the earth may help create ozone ,which protects us from the sun's harmful rays.Lightning dancing across a summer night sky is a force to be respected and appreciated-from a distance.", "id": "high23049.txt"}
