The research also showed that a large percentage of women start noticing the pounds creeping back on just 21 days after reaching their ideal weight.\nYesterday, Dr Ian Campbell of the Jenny Craig weight management program said, 'In the UK 61.4 percent of adults are overweight or obese. Successful weight management requires a long-term commitment in order to lose weight successfully and for good. Dieting can be a real challenge so setting realistic goals and remaining focused on them is important. Otherwise as this research shows, women could end up heavier than when they started.'\nThe \"Food, Body, Mind\" report was publicized by Jenny Craig who quizzed 2000 women aged between 18 and 65 who diet regularly on their attitudes, beliefs and behaviors around weight loss. Six in ten said they were currently on a diet and one in five women said they were on a continuous diet.\nIt found the most common triggers to start dieting was seeing their reflection in the mirror,  preparing for a summer holiday or unflattering photos posted on social networking sites. Other popular reasons include comments by friends or relatives or their other half.\nHowever, the study showed that one in ten give up within one day, while almost a fifth manage to make it to a week or more. The average is ten days. Many blamed pressure they put on themselves to lose weight too quickly for the weight gain, which leaves them with a bigger appetite than normal. Others blamed colleagues, who tuck into fatty lunches and snacks unaware of the effect it has on the dieter, while mothers' polishing off their children's leftovers was another common cause of weight gain.", "id": "high2129.txt"}
