Their hands are spinkled with perfumed  water. In addition, this festival is for rain because it is the hottest season.\nNowadays, during the Songkran Festival, people always wet down everybody who walks past their houses or walks down the streets with cups or buckets of water. Everyone gets wet, but it is all in a spirit of friendliness, blessing and fun. People who get wet actually do not get angry because they know that it is traditional.\nPeople will go to the temples to batheBuddha imagesand give special food to the monks. People do good things such as fish or birds and other animals releasedfrom their cages. On this day, everywhere in Thailand, people celebrate and enjoy the festival, especiallly in the northern part of Thailand.\nWe can see many foreigners join in the events and enjoyed this festival with Thais.
