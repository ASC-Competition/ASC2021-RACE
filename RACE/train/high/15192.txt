I don't have the time to waste on someone so small.\" The rabbit was shocked by the elephant's words. Then he decided to ask the whale  what she thought about the elephant's rudeness. But the whale laughed at this tiny animal. The rabbit said, \"You think that I am weak, but in fact, I am strong! I can beat you at Tug-of-War  .\"The whale looked at him for a moment before bursting into laughter. \"Very well, little one. Go and get a rope,\" she said.The rabbit ran off to find a strong and thick rope. Then he went to the elephant, \"Elephant, I will beat you at a game of Tug-of-War.\" The elephant laughed loudly, but agreed to challenge the tiny animal. He tied the rope around his huge waist. The rabbit took the other end and ran away. He called back to the elephant, \"When I say 'pull', you start pulling. \"The rabbit took the other end of the rope to the whale, \"Tie this to your tail and when I say 'pull',you swim.\" The whale tied the rope to her tail after laughing at the rabbit's foolishness. Then the rabbit called out \"PULL!\" The elephant and the whale began pulling. After a while, they were too tired to continue. The elephant and the whale never knew how such a tiny creature could beat them. But from that day on, they said \"hello\" to the little rabbit with great respect whenever they met.", "id": "high15192.txt"}
