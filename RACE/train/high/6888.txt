The papers he had been carrying were returned to England, where they were carefully examined. They had clearly been changed and that was exactly what the British had hoped would happen, for Martin was a trick designed to fool the Germans.\nMartin did not exist. The body was that of a sailor who looked as though he had died when his boat sank, but in fact he had been ill and died. Leaving the boat to go down, his parents allowed the dead body to be put into the sea near Spain. It was hoped that the Germans would find it and read the fake papers he carried.\nThe papers said that the British would attack the island of Sardinia, when in fact they planned to attack the island of Sicily.
