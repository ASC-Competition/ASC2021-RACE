It looked like he was carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, \"Why would anyone bring home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd (a foolish person).\" I had quite a weekend planned, so I shrugged my shoulders and went on.\nAs I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running towards him. They knocked all his books out of his arms and tripped  him so he landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw _ land in the glass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this terrible sadness in his eyes. So, I jogged over to him and as he crawled around looking for his glasses, I saw a tear in his eye.\nAs I handed him his glasses, I said, \"Those guys are jerks. They really should go to hell.\" He looked at me and said, \"Hey, thanks!\" There was a big smile on his face. It was one of those smiles that showed real thankfulness. I asked him where he lived. As it turned out, he lived near me.\nOver the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He had to prepare a speech for graduation. As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began. \"Graduation is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough years. I am here to tell you a story.\"\nI just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of the first day we met. He had planned to kill himself over the weekend. He talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't have to do it later and was carrying his stuff home. He looked hard at me and gave me a little smile. \"Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from doing the unspeakable.\"\nI heard the gasp  go through the crowd as this handsome, popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I saw his Mom and Dad looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not until that moment did I realize its depth.", "id": "high4911.txt"}
