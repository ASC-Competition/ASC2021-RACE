A new report by the journal Biological Reviews called \" The Extinction of Dinosaurs\" concludes that this impact was, indeed, the cause of the dinosaurs' _ . But the space blast  wasn't the only reason these creatures aren't still around today.\nDinosaurs need food to survive. Meat-eating monsters like the Tyrannosaurus Rex  were at the top of the food chain,  and fed off plant eaters like the horned Triceratops  .  These herbivores    were decreasing in population after the asteroid hit Earth, which left the meat-eating species less food to survive on. \"In any ecosystem where you remove links to key species, that community has problems,\" Richard Butler, one of the review's authors, told National Ceographic.\nWhile the herbivore population was going down, Earth's temperatures were rising when volcanoes erupted. Hot vapors and gases began wiping out some of the dinosaur population and weakening the survivors.\nThese changes made the asteroid's impact especially powerful. It caused more volcanoes to erupt, heated up Earth's atmosphere, and led to a sharp drop in the level of oxygen in the oceans.\nWith the dinosaurs gone, mammals  began to evolve into bigger and more diverse species. Many animals we see today, like birds, sharks, and even some cats and dogs, appeared after the asteroid hit Earth. But none rule Earth quite like the dinosaurs did..", "id": "high8752.txt"}
