Some have an even bigger reasonto stay calm or out of prison. But Back on My Feet puts recovering addicts and the homeless on the road to a brighter future, starting with a simple step; attending group runs three tunes a week.\nAt 5:30 a.m. on a hot July day, Back on My Feet's Team Brooklyn gathered in a parking lot. After a round of hugs and some warm-up, the group of eight volunteers and seven residents set out on a run to nearby Prospect Park. Some ran three miles, some longer, but the goal for all was to finish as a team\n\"It's helping me put my life back together,\" said Jimmy, a 58-year-old cancer survivor who was homeless and a former alcohol addict. \"It's healthy. It makes me feel good inside,\" adds Jimmy.\nMany are skeptical about the idea of homeless runners, according to Anne Mahlum, who founded Back on My Feet in 2007 after starting a running club for men at a shelter near her Philadelphia home. They did want to run, and in just six years, Mahlum's small running club has expanded to 10 cities around the country, and 388 active members.\nThe only requirement for joining, besides wanting to, is insisting on at least 30 days.\"The first day we give them new shoes and Back on My Feet shirts,\" Mahlum says. \"Then they run a mile the first day. And then gradually we'll encourage them to build goals. \"After 30 days,residents gain access to services like financial aid,housing assistance and employment opportunities through Back on My Feet's partners. In its first year, the New York chapter has seen 41 members obtain employment, 34 gain housing and 50 work in job-training programs.\nThat's not to say it's always easy. \"I wanted to quit. But then I started to push myself,\"said Adel, 39, who began running in March. \"Now I would love to run a 10-mile run. Or maybe a marathon one day, who knows. I ran this far, so why not?\"", "id": "high17597.txt"}
