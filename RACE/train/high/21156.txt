She was given the title Empress Zhenshun after her death. \n\"It's rare for a concubine to be given so much posthumous   honor in the history of Chinese feudal   society,\" said Liu Daiyun, research director at the Shaanxi Archaeological Research Institute. \nHer tomb ---53 meters wide by 56 meters long --- is located in the west of Pangliu village, which is part of Xi'an's Chang'an district. \nThe recovered sarcophagus   is 4 meters long, 2 meters wide and 2 meters tall and is decorated with flowers and maiden figures, which archaeologists say is a rare cultural relic of high scientific, historical and artistic value. In ancient times, a sarcophagus was used to house wood coffins in order to preserve the body of the noble person.\n\"I knew it was precious but I didn't know it was so beautiful,\" said Han Qinglong, who headed the team that brought the relic back to China four years after it was stolen and sold abroad by tomb raiders  .", "id": "high21156.txt"}
