The Confederation of British Industry(CBI) warns that the qualification is stopping teachers delivering an \"inspirational classroom experience\" and should be replaced.\nJohn Cridland, the CBI director general, said industry faced a shortage of key skills, particularly in science and maths. The CBI , which represents more than 240,000 companies, is also concerned about the 40% of young people who fail to achieve the _ of five good GCSE passes including English and maths. The percentage of pupils who reach this standard is the main measure of school success.\nSpeaking at the launch of a CBI inquiry into education, Cridland argued that abandoning GCSEs could help deliver a full education. \"There's something about this GCSE limitation which produces a form of learning ------ teaching for the test.''\n\"It frustrates teachers because it stops them delivering that inspirational classroom experience.\"\nThe CBI head suggested that raising the school leaving age to 18 - a change that comes into effect in 2015 - is an opportunity to reform the system. \"It seems to me that we've raised the participation age to 18 and we're left with an education system that focuses on 16,\" said Cridland. More than 600,000 children in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to take GCSEs this summer.\nMany other countries do without a public exam at 16. Finland, the highest performing school system in Europe, has just one public exam, at 18, though children are regularly tested at younger ages.", "id": "high4960.txt"}
