Miss Jarvis started her campaign in 1906 in her home city Philadelphia. She wrote thousands of letters to congressmen ,city officials, teachers and newspaper publishers, proposing   an official holiday for mothers. She traveled all over America, trying to get support for the idea. Her battle went on for years.\nIn 1914 the Congress declared  the second Sunday in May each year as Mother's Day. Anna Jarvis wanted Mother's Day to be a simple event. She thought children could honor their mothers by spending some time with them as an act of love and respect. However, the holiday turned out to be a major event for department stores, flower shops and greeting card industry, which Miss Jarvis didn't like.\n   Americans spend millions of dollars on gifts for their mothers on this day. Younger children often try to prepare and serve breakfast for their mothers. Fathers may offer to take care of children so that mothers can enjoy themselves. The holiday becomes an important time for family fathering.", "id": "high16849.txt"}
