In fact, just like in China, in the United States, high school is usually divided into two periods, the first two or three years are called \"junior high school\" and the other is \"senior high school\".\nIn China, children enjoy free education of nine years, but in the United States, the students enjoy free education(which will be started when they are about 6 years old) until they are 18 years old. As a result of the free education system, American children have little difficulty in going to senior high school.\nAmerican high school students can take part in a lot of activities outside of the classroom. The activities are organized by the school, such as joining a music group or a sports team. Certainly, just like us students in China, American students have to work hard in order to get good marks if they want to go to a good university. They take classes in all kinds of subjects all through the high school period. And students with low marks at the end of a school year are still allowed to go on to the next grade.\nIn American high schools, there is fighting or hurting or other kinds of bad behaviors. So children who want to go to university are often sent to suburban   high schools, where most students want to go to university and the atmosphere   is quite different.", "id": "high9480.txt"}
