Their style of painting is called Impressionism. They used primary colors and short brush strokes  in their work. They recognized Mary 's spirit and powerful talent and invited her to exhibit in the Impressionist art shows.\nMary painted what she saw: gardens, and paintings of persons , especially of mothers and children involved in everyday living. One of her paintings, \"Young Mother and Two Children,\" was given to the White House in 1954 where it hangs today.\nMary never married and, in 1877, her parents and sister moved to Europe to join her.
