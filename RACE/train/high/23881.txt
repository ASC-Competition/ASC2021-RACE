It was mysterious;neither of them had touched it,not even a little bit.True.it hadn't stood steadily when their host placed it on the table,but it hadn't fallen then.\n    The crash of the thermos caused the host,with a box of sugar cubes in his hand,to rush back from the inner room.He looked foolishly at the steaming floor and blurted out. \"It doesn't matter!

It wasn't steady when Mr. Li put it there.\nDaddy,why did you say that?\"\n    \"That won't do,girl.It sounds more acceptable when I say I knocked it down.There are things which people accept less true it sounds.\"\n    The daughter was lost in silence for a while.Then she said,\"Can you explain it only this way?\"\n    \"Only this way.\"her father said.", "id": "high23881.txt"}
