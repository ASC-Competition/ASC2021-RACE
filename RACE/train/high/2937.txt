Most of the 1,528 children were teenagers when the study began. Those still living are now in their 80s. In 1936 and 1940, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to obtain information about difficult life events and their effect on overall outlook. One such question was, \"What do you regard as your most serious fault of personality or character?\"\nPessimists were defined as fatalistic people who tend to blame themselves when things go wrong and who believe that one bad event can ruin the rest of their life. They also tend to expect bad things to happen to them and feel that they have little or no ability to change their situation.\nMales were more likely than females to be classified as pessimistic. Compared with individuals with a more cheerful and optimistic outlook, pessimists were more likely to die from accidents and violence (including suicide).\nA pessimistic personality may lead to poor problem-solving ability, social difficulties and risky decision-making. Taken together, these variables put the pessimist at higher risk of untimely  death, say the researchers. Such a person is less likely to avoid or escape potentially dangerous situations, the researchers concluded. \"A pessimistic way of thinking in which people worry too much about bad events, predicts untimely death decades later,\" according to Peterson.", "id": "high2937.txt"}
