At first, Carmen wasn't really sure what was happening. In class, she had tosquint  to see the blackboard clearly. As it got worse, she became more and more worried. It was important for her to see the notes and homework the teacher wrote on the board.\nIn class, she asked for a desk that was closer to the blackboard. One day, her teacher said, \"Carmen, I've noticed you squinting a lot. Are you having trouble seeing the board?\" Carmen shook her head. \"I'm fine, Mrs. Cruz.\"\nAt home, she had to sit closer and closer to the television. Her mother noticed her squinting as she watched her favorite shows.\n\"Tomorrow I will go to see a doctor,\" she said firmly. Three days later, Carmen had new glasses. She was told to wear them all the time. \"All of the kids at school will think I am anerd ,\" she said. \"You look just as beautiful with those glasses on as you do without them,\" her mother said. But Carmen didn't believe her.\nThe next day, Carmen kept the glasses in her pocket as she walked into the schoolyard. Suddenly, she heard her friend Theresa shout. \"What's wrong?\" she asked.\n\"My silver ring is gone!\" Theresa cried. Carmen could tell that Theresa was very upset. They all looked for the ring in the grassy area of the playground.\nCarmen realized that she could search better if she could see better. She took the glasses out of her pocket and put them on. Everything looked so different! So clear! And aglimmer   of silver caught her eye.\n\"Here it is,\" she shouted. \"Thanks Carmen,\" Theresa said. \"I didn't know you wore glasses. They look great!\" \"Thanks,\" Carmen replied shyly.\nAs they walked back toward the school building, two more girls praised her glasses. Carmen smiled. \"Maybe wearing glasses won't be so bad after all,\" she thought.", "id": "high690.txt"}
