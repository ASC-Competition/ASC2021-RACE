And the scientists who have conducted the study fear that insects' abilities to drive away enemies and attract mates may also be disturbed.\nProfessor Jose Fuentes, who led the study, said, \"Scent molecules  produced by flowers in a less polluted environment could travel for roughly 1,000 to 1,200 meters. But today they may travel only 200 to 300 meters. This makes it increasingly difficult for bees and other insects to locate the flowers.\"\nThe researchers, who worked on the molecules of snapdragons ,found that the molecules are volatile  and quickly bond with pollutants, mainly formed from vehicle emissions. This chemically changes the molecules so that they no longer smell like flowers. A harmful cycle is therefore set up where insects struggle to get enough food and the plants do not get pollinated enough to multiply.\nAlready bees, which pollinate most of the world's crops, are in such a great decline that has never been known before in Britain and across much of the globe. At least a quarter of America's 2.5 million honey bee colonies have been mysteriously wiped out by colony collapse disorder(CCD),where hives are found suddenly deserted.\nThe crisis  has now spread to Europe. Politicians insist that CCD has not yet been found in Britain, but considering the present number of bees, the agriculture minister Lord Rooker has sent the warning, \"The honey bee population could be wiped out in 10 years.\"\nAlthough the researchers are not certain whether this is the real cause of CCD, they say that pollution is making life more difficult for bees and other insects in many ways.", "id": "high1857.txt"}
