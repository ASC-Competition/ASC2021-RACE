For this busy man, it was a sort of alarm: after years of non-stop hard work, he might wear himself out and die an early death.\nOnly after a week's leave---- during which he read novels, listened to music and walked with his wife on a beach---- was Rudenstine able to return to work.\nIn our modern life, we have lost the rhythm between action and rest. Amazingly, within this world there is a universal but silly saying: \"I am so busy.\"\nWe say this to one another as if our tireless efforts were a talent by nature and an ability to successfully deal with stress. The busier we are, the more important we seem to ourselves and, we imagine, to others. To be unavailable to our friends and family, and to be unable to find time to relax---- this has become the model of a successful life.\nBecause we do not rest, we lose our way. We miss the guide telling us where to go, the food providing us with strength, the quiet giving us wisdom.\nHow have we allowed this to happen? I believe it is this: we have forgotten the Sabbath, the day of the week---- for followers of some religions---- for rest and praying. It is a day when we are not supposed to work, a time when we devote ourselves to enjoying and celebrating what is beautiful. It is a good time to bless our children and loved ones, give thanks, share meals, walk and sleep. It is a time for us to take a rest, to put our work aside, trusting that there are larger forces at work taking care of the world.\nRest is a spiritual and biological need; however, in our strong ambition to be successful and care for our many responsibilities, we may feel terribly guilty when we take time to rest. The Sabbath gives us permission to stop work. In fact, \"Remember the Sabbath\" is more than simply permission to rest; it is a rule to obey and a principle to follow.", "id": "high8770.txt"}
