Therefore, I think friendship is the most important relationship that anybody could have.\nThe qualities I look for in a friend are a good sense of humor but sensitivity when it matters. Also that friend would have to be strong-minded and highly spirited. I think that these qualities are the key qualities to look for in a good friend.\nEven the strongest friends can still have arguments, although usually about more serious topics, rather than the usual teenage childish arguments. Some matters can seriously affect a friendship. If one of your friends started experimenting with harmful and dangerous drugs, what would you do ? A good friend would try to help as much as possible, whereas a bad example of a friend would simply shrug  and turn a blind eye.\nNot only the bad things affect friendship ---- good activities do too. Such as bonding with one another, not just by going out on a night with them but by spending quality time with them and talking to each other, which indicates a good ability to communicate. This is a key aspect of a good friendship.\nGood friends do not always have to be in the same age group as you. I have a good friend and she is 47 years old and I am 16.\nUnfortunately, some people lose contact with their friends as they grow older, which is a sad way to lose a good friend.\nI think friendship is one of the most important things in life because if you have no friends you will have no happiness.", "id": "high6430.txt"}
