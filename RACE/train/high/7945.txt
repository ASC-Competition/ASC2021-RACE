Pluto   is no longer classified as a planet.)\nPluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon(called Charon). Its orbit  is unusual, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid  methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze . When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid  methane.\nPluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow.\nThe discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet(he called it Planet X)based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these \"irregularities\" weren't real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be(although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations).In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell's last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We'll never know.", "id": "high7945.txt"}
