If there is one -which I take leave to doubt- it is older people who create it, not young themselves. Let us get down to fundamental s and then the young are after all human beings -people just like their elders. There is only one difference between and old man and young one: the young man has a beautiful future before him while the old man a splendid future behind him and maybe that id where the rub is.\nWhen I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and unknown -that I was a new boy in a hug w school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the thing s the young are busily engaged in seeking.\nI find young people exciting .they have and air of freedom, and they have not a dull promise to mean ambitious or love of comfort .they are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to important things .all this seems to me to ling then with life, and the origin of things .it's as if they were some sense of cosmic beings in violent and lovely contract with us suburban creatures. all that is in my mind when I need a young person .he may be too proud, ill-mannered or self-satisfied, but I do not turn for protection to boring cliches about respect for elders as if age were a reason for respect .I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with them, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.", "id": "high23502.txt"}
