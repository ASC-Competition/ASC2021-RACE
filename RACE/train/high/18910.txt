Every person has his opinion toward this kind behavior of police. Some of them think of it to be improper because the captain himself is also a victim in this accident, what's more, his wife, who also boarded on this boat, remains missing now. While others are in support of this action, to them, it is the captain who should shoulder the responsibility. For me, I agree with the former. Because the captain has made every effort to deal with the accident.", "id": "high18910.txt"}
