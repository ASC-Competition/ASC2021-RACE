In The Journal of Neuroscience, experts report that the brain might hold more memories than people realize, but that restoring those memories can be tricky.\nMemory Check\nFirst, participants saw a list of 120 real words mixed with 80 nonsense words. Next, they saw another word list and tried to remember which words had been on the first list. Meanwhile, their brains were scanned with functional magnetic resonance  imaging.\nWhile participants reviewed the second word list, their brain scans showed more activity in a certain brain area -- the posterior  median temporal lobe  -- when they saw words that had been on the first word list.\nBut participants didn't always remember that they'd seen those words before. Sometimes, they _ and said they hadn't seen those words before. In other words, the posterior median temporal lobe was more sensitive to memory than participants' consciousness, the researchers note.\n\"Album\"of Memories\nAnother part of the median temporal lobe also attracted the scientists' attention. The anterior median temporal lobe showed more activity when participants thought they were seeing a new word, the study shows.\nSo, why did participants sometimes mess up their memory recall? It might be that two parts of their brain -- the posterior and anterior median temporal lobes -- might be dueling  for the upper hand in deciding what actually happened in the past, the study notes.\nIn other words, memories might have a photo album in the brain, but sometimes we forget what's on all of the photo album's pages.", "id": "high9673.txt"}
