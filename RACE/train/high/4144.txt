There was no immediate comment from the firm but its website said it undertook projects that make \"land from water by providing large-scale floating constructions to create similar conditions as on land\".\nThe Maldives began work on an artificial island known as the Hulhumale near the crowded capital island of Male in 1997 and more than 30,000 people have been settled there to ease _ . The city, which has a population of 100,000, is already protected from rising sea levels by a 30-million-dollar sea wall, and the government is considering increasingly imaginative ways to combat climate change.\nNasheed, who staged the world's first underwater cabinet meeting in October to highlight his people's dilemma , has even spoken of buying land elsewhere in the world to enable Maldivians to relocate if their homes are flooded. He has also pledged the Hulhumale to turn his nation into a model for the rest of the world by becoming \"carbon neutral\" by 2020. His plan involves ending fossil fuel use and powering all vehicles and buildings from \"green\" sources.", "id": "high4144.txt"}
