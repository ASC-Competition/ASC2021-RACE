He had never heard of China's idol   of selflessness before he arrived in the country, but this unusual young man from Nigeria is carrying on the good work of China's hero soldier.\nMusa's week begins with a crowded two-hour bus ride for a flag-raising ceremony   at Chunmiao Primary School with old classrooms for the children of migrant   workers on the outside parts of Wuhan.An hour later, he steps in front of a room full of expectant   students, some of whom recently organized a dance exhibition for their foreign teacher.\nThe dance showed the spirit of Lei Feng (1940-1962), a soldier who was idolized   across China for his selflessness. It was especially meaningful to Musa because the students call him \"foreign Lei Feng\".\n\"I know Lei Feng, he is a good man. Everyone should learn from Lei Feng,\" he says.\nBorn to a family of diplomats   in 1985, he is the second of nine children and the eldest son. Musa was expected to become a diplomat like his father, who worked in Canada from 2007.In 2008, Musa was picked by Nigeria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study in China for a master's degree in sociology  . With the hope of joining the foreign service, he then went on to study for a doctor's degree in international relations at Central China Normal University.", "id": "high5237.txt"}
