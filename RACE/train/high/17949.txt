About 50 students participated in a 30-minute workout after school on Friday in the school's gym. This was a Fit Fridays program introduced at the school by Families Plus, a non-profit group that provides programs to enrich the lives of families and children in Frederick County.\nThe free program aims to encourage students from kindergarten through fifth grade to be physically active by having them participate in various age-appropriate activities designed to promote a love of exercise, according to Kim Ragan, head of the program.\nThe program, which started at the school on Nov.9, 2012, has since become a hit, Ragan said.\nEmily Liston, 37, said the program allows students to focus on fitness as a priority in their lives. \"There're so many things to stop them from being active,\" she said. \"So, anything to keep them moving is good, especially in the winter months\".\nJennifer Mitchell, 40, whose daughter Alexandra, 7, participated in the Fit Fridays program, said that learning the importance of being active isn't the only thing students are learning from the new program. \"It's a great opportunity for them to get some exercise and also to learn to get along and socialize, to learn teamwork,\" she said. \"In school they have to do activities like this but they want to do it.\" \nRiley Glynn, 9, a fourth grader at the school, said his favorite part of the program is getting to spend more time with his friends. \"It's fun to play with people,\" Riley said. \"It's like physical education after school but it really helps you.\"  \n\"You learn how to make yourself stronger,\" said Megan Hummel, 7, a first grader.\nRagan said she plans to expand the program to include other schools in the county, but she has been having trouble finding fitness instructors to participate. \"As soon as I can get instructors to teach we'll expand,\" she said.", "id": "high17949.txt"}
