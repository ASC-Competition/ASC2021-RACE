But then Jane Austen wrote her novels in England, she was writing about a world that most of us would not recognize.\nBut today Austen's books are in greater demand than ever. In the last ten years, five of the six novels have been made into Hollywood films, while her books continue to be bestsellers. So why is Austen still popular?\nRichard Jenkyns, a professor of English at Oxford University, argues that her novels still appeal to people because they focus on issues that are as _ today as they were when she wrote them. Her novels are about women trying to find a perfect husband, but also explore issues surrounding marriage, friendship and the family. \"The plots are fairly timeless stories about human interaction which are familiar to us,\" Jenkyns says.\nThe most famous book Austen wrote is Pride and Prejudice,a love story betweenElizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. At first the two characters do not get on. They finally fall in love, but still have to overcome opposition   to their relationship from their families.\nAll of Austen's books are easy to read, making them popular with children and adults, but they work on different levels so people can take what they need from them, author Kate Henry says.\nAusten is often praised as the greatest romance writer in the English language, so it is surprising she remained unmarried. \"Maybe she was too much of a romantic, waiting for a perfect man,\" Henry says.", "id": "high11562.txt"}
