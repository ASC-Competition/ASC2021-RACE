Most waves are caused by winds blowing over the surface of the water.The sun heats the earth,causing the air to rise and the winds to blow.The winds blow across the sea,pushing little waves into bigger and bigger ones.\n  The size of a wave depends on how strong the wind is,how long it blows,and how large the body of water is.In a small bay big waves will never build up,but at sea the wind can build up giant,powerful waves.\n  A rule says that the height of a wave (in meters)will usually be no more than one-tenth of the wind's speed(in kilometers).In other words,when the wind is blowing at 120 kilometers per hour,most waves will be about twelve meters of course,and some waves may combine to form giant\nwaves that are much higher.In 1933 the United States Navy reported the largest measured wave in\nhistory.It rose in the Pacific Ocean to a height of thirty-four meters.", "id": "high22412.txt"}
