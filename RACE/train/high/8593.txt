Here are some ways to improve it.\nRemember and repeat in conversation . When you hear a person's name , repeat it.\nImmediately say it to yourself several times without moving your lips . you could also repeat the name in a way that sounds natural.\nAsk the other person to recite and repeat . You can let other people help you remember their names. After you've been introduced to someone , ask that person to spell the name and pronounce it correctly for you . Most people will be glad by the effort that you're making to learn their names.\nAdmit  that you don't know .You may tell them that you can't remember someone's name . Most of them will feel glad if you say, \"I'm working to remember your names better . Yours is right on the tip of my tongue . What is it again?\"\nUse associations . Link each person yon meet with one thing you find interesting or unusual.\nFor example, you can remember in this way : \"Vicki Cheng ----tall, black hair.\" To remember their names , you can write them on a small card as soon as possible.\nLimit the number of new names you learn at one time. When meeting a group of people, you'd better remember just two or three names. Free yourself from remembering every one. Few of the people expect you to remember their names. Another way is to limit yourself to learning just first names. Last names can come later.\nGo early . Consider going early to meetings , parties and classes . Sometimes just a few people show up on time . There're fewer names for you to remember. And as more people arrive , you can hear them being introduced to others .", "id": "high8593.txt"}
