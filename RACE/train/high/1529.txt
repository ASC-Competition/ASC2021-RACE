They play games, share stories and go on trips.\nThe program has already helped many Salem students.\nBriana's mentor is the school principal  , Syeda Woods. Woods took Briana ice-skating, to pizza parties and for a visit to Longwood Gardens in Pennsylvania. \"When I got out, I saw that Salem is a very small place,\" Briana said. \"The program helps me experience the outside world and see many new things.\"\nKathy Jennings, 13, said she was very shy before, but now is much more open.\n\"In the program, I see my mentor as a big sister, not a teacher.
