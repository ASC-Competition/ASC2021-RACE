It refers to students who choose not to attend the best college they can get into.They instead go to a less selective one,perhaps one that is closer to home or less expensive.About half of the low--income students with a grade-point average of at least3.5 in high school and an SAT score of at least 1,200 do not attend the best college they could have.  \"I was really astonished by the degree to which well--qualified students from poor families under-matched,\" said Mr.Bowen.\nIn fact,well-off students attend the colleges that do the best job of producing graduates.Meanwhile,lower-income students-even when they are better qualified--often go to colleges that excel in producing drop-outs.\"It's really a waste,\"Mr.Bowen said,\"and a big problem for the country.\"As the authors point out, the only way to lift the college graduation rate significantly is to lift it among poor and working--class students. Instead,it appears to have fallen. \n   What can be done? Money is clearly part of the answer.", "id": "high22480.txt"}
