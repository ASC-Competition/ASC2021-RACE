Carbon Day Automotive, a Chicagobased company,has now demonstrated a solarpowered recharging point, known as the Solar PlugIn Station,which lets motorists easily charge their cars using electricity that has been produced without any environmental damage.\nThe Solar PlugIn Station has gone on show in Chicago as part of the city's bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games. According to Carbon Day Automotive,the Solar PlugIn Station on show in Chicago is part of the vital infrastructure  required for electric vehicles in Chicago and was the focus of a recent visit by the International Olympic Committee.\nThese solarpowered electricity points will be used daily to fuel the city's electric vehicles with power from the sun. By producing the electricity from pollutionfree solar cell, the CO2 emissions are reduced to zero.\n\"Solar energy and electric vehicles are a partnership that is one more step to reducing our dependence on foreign oil,\" says Richard Lowenthal, CEO of Coulomb Technologies.Coulomb Technologies recently developed the components   required for individual recharging stations,marketed as ChargePoint Networked Charging Stations.Carbon Day Automotive is the Midwest distributor for the ChargePoint stations. The Solar PlugIn Station consists of giant solar panels   that shade the tiny ChargePoint Networked Charging Station.The solar panel is connected to an underground battery pack,ready for everyday refueling.\n\"Without these stations it would be like driving around in a traditional car without the availability of gas stations,\" says Scott Emalfarb,CEO at Carbon Day.\"The day of true plugin electric vehicles will be here sooner than most people realize and the world needs to be ready to accommodate(......)them.\"", "id": "high5358.txt"}
