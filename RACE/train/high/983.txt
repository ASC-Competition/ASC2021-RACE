Such comments seem to suggest Kahlo had a big influence on the art world of her time. Sadly, she is actually _ today than she was during her time.\nBorn in 1907 in a village near Mexico City , Kahlo suffered from polio at the age of seven. Her spine  become bent as she grew older. Then, in 1925, her back was broken in several places in a school-bus accident. Throughout the rest of her life, the artist had many operations, but nothing was able to cure the terrible pain in her back. However, the accident had an unexpected side effect. While lying in her bed recovering, Kahlo taught herself to paint.\nIn 1929, she got married to Diego Rivera, another famous Mexican artist. Rivera's strong influences on Kahlo's style can be seen in her early works, but her later works from the 1940s, known today as her best works, show less influence from her husband.\nUnfortunately, her works did not attract much attention in the 1930s and1940s, even in her home country. Her first one-woman show in Mexico was not held until 1953.For more than a decade after her death in 1954, Kahlo's works remained largely unnoticed by the world, but in the 1970s her works began to gain international fame at last.", "id": "high983.txt"}
