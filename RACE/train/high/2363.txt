But one more has just been added - a communications blackout caused by solar storms.\nAfter a period of calm within the Sun, scientists have detected the signs of a flesh cycle of sunspots that could peak in 2012, just in time for the arrival of the Olympic torch in London.\nNow scientists believe that this peak could result in vast solar explosions that could throw billions of tons of charged matter towards the Earth, causing strong solar storms that could jam the telecommunications satellites and interact links sending five Olympic broadcast from London.\n\"The Sun's activity has a strong influence on the Earth. The Olympics could be in the middle of the next solar maximum which could affect the functions of communications satellites,\" said Professor Richard Harrison, head of space physics at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire.\nAt the peak of the cycle, violent outbursts called coronalmass ejections  occur in the Sun's atmosphere, throwing out great quantities of electrically-charged matter. \" A coronal mass ejection can carry a billion tons of solar material into space at over a million    kilometres per hour. Such events can expose astronauts to a deadly amount, can disable satellites, cause power failures on Earth and disturb communications,\" Professor Harrison added. The risk is greatest during a solar maximum when there is the greatest number of sunspots.\nNext week in America, NASA is scheduled to launch a satellite for monitoring solar activity called the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), which will take images of the Sun that are 10 times clearer than the most advanced televisions available.\nThe Rutherford Appleton Laboratory helped to make the high-tech cameras that will capture images of the solar flares   and explosions as they occur.\nProfessor Richard Hold away, the lab's director, said that the SDO should be able to provide early warning of a solar flare or explosion big enough to affect satellite communications on Earth \"If we have advance warning, we'll be able to reduce the damage. _", "id": "high2363.txt"}
