Some readers have written in to ask us for the latest information on high quality books on English, so here we introduce two texts that aim to improve spoken English fluency.\nLet's speak (Beginner)\nBy Bev Dusuya, Naoko Ozeki and Kevin Bergman\nISBN: 962001359X\nSpeak Up(Pre-Intermediate)\nBy Bev Kusuya, Nako Zeki\nISBN: 0583338050\n\"Teach the students about your culture and help them talk about their own.\" How often are these worthy goals kept from being achieved by the limitations of your beginner level learners? Students at all levels want to talk about culture.\nTopics include food, shopping, sports, fashion, the roles of men and women, health, music, and many more.\nThese are all chosen from surveys of over 15,000 students about their own interests in cross-cultural communication.\n\"Let's Speak\" and \"Speak Up\" share a special but excellent way that allows all students to take part in. \n The series has questions which start thinking and then help collect opinions about personal topics. Conversation practice is provided by ready to use  models of basic exchanges on the topic. Also, the cultural information presented in the series comes in the form of interesting, relevant facts and ideas from other countries through listening tasks and Culture Quiz exercises.\nTeam activities in books provide lively problem solving games to enable sharing and comparison of cultural values.\n\"Let's Speak\" is fit for entry level students of all ages. \"Speak Up\" provides for the needs of higher level beginners, offering the same careful listening and speaking help, but with slightly more open ended discussion.\nFor any information about AWL's books, please get in touch with the following addresses:\nprefix = st1 /Beijing AddisonWesleyLongmanInformationCenter\nRoom 2306, FLTRP Beijing\n19 Xi San Huan Beilu, Beijing100081\nTel: (010)68917488 (010) 68917788\nFax: (010) 68917499\nE-mail: zrh@public.bat.net.cn", "id": "high23765.txt"}
