When someone gives you something to wear that corresponds to your self-image,they're saying,\"I agree with you.I like you the way you are.\"Such a gift should be taken as a form of compliment.On the other hand,a gift of clothing that does not match your personality could be an insult to your character .\n    Expensive gifts   Naturally, some gifts like jewelry will be more expensive than others.But some people give higher priced gifts than necessary for the situation.Someone who gives an expensive gift often feels that he should receive more praise than if he had given a less expensive gift.Therefore he is giving himself a gift,too status.\n     Homemade gifts   Making something by hand has become the exception in many countries today--so much so that giving a homemade gift is sometimes considered extraordinary.If you receive a homemade gift,you're lucky.It may no.t be made perfectly, but it will show a certain quality of love.No matter what the results of the homemade gift look like,remember it's  the thought that counts.     \n    Books  People who gives books as gifts either like reading or would like everyone to think they do.A good way to know this is to find out whether or not the giver bought the book according to how large it is.If you happen to receive a large heavy book, its giver may be much more interested in the way things appear than in the way they actually are.
