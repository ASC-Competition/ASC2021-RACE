Being poor is a terrible feeling when your 3-year-old finishes his meal and says: \"Can I have some more bread and jam   please, Mummy?\" And you break down in tears, because you don't know how to tell him that there is no more food. With PS6, I went to the supermarket, picked up some food and started to cook at home. It was time for me to make a change and get back on my feet. I began to write a series of articles for the website named Hunger Hurt in July 2011.\nA few months later, local food bank gave me some help-- with some free vegetables every month, which made my life a little easier. I began to write recipes , posting them on my blog. To my surprise, families, students and those poor people told me how much it helped to see healthy recipes made from affordable supermarket vegetables.\nMy Life took unexpected turns. I was invited to give a speech on food , interviewed for an Oxfam report on food banks and asked to write a cookery book.\nWhen I got the money from the book, for the first night in almost two years, I went to bed without worrying. Now, I have a well-paid job and a beautiful home, and I'll never forget the days when I worked hard for a good life.", "id": "high9317.txt"}
