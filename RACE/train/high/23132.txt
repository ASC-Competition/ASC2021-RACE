The federal budget has allocated $25 million to support the awards open to emerging artists. The aim is to create a prize that has the prestige   of a Nobel Prize.    \n\"When you think about the major prizes of the world ---- the Nobel Prize in Sweden,the Kyoto prizes in Japan or the Booker Prize in the U.K . --- they bring great honor and opportunity to the countries that award them,\" Pecaut said.\"The idea here is that every year,the Canada prizes will be awarded to the very best promising emerging artists around the world in those four fields. \" \n   A jury   of international experts would judge the 12 finalists,who would come to Canada and perform or show their work in public to win the Canada prizes.The performances would be televised, allowing Canadians across the country to see it.\nThe federal government liked the idea of such an international prize that would advance Canada's brand,draw tourists and arts professionals from around the world.For the Canadian arts community, one of the greatest challenges is connecting to that international arts world to come up with co-productions and foreign investment and touring chances.\n    A group is working toward establishing the prize by 2010,with potential for semi-final rounds to take place about the same time as the Vancouver Olympic Games.\"Thirty or forty years from now,the future outstanding dancers and performers will look back and say, 'I broke out on the world scene in Toronto -- that's where I was discovered.' \"", "id": "high23132.txt"}
