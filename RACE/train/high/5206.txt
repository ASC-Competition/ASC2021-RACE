There was my daughter, 8 months old, playing at my feet while I was typing away on the couch. There was me and my son, with the laptop at my side as I held him in my arms.\nI'd heard about the Internet addiction before, but always assumed I was something limited to socially challenged guys who played too much World of Warcraft (a computer game).

I read news, keep up with friends and write my blog ... just for something to do.\nIt turns out that I'm not the only mama who is addicted to the computer. These moms are contributing to a growing global addiction. There's a movement among psychiatrists (doctors who specialize in mental diseases) to recognize the Internet addiction as an official mental disorder.
