My son was in the 4thgrade last year, and he had a teacher called Miss Green. I believe that when he is an adult he will surely look back on her as the best teacher he has ever had.\nMy son has attention deficit disorder  that makes it a little more difficult for him to learn. She was able to change her teaching methods for him so that he could keep up with the rest of the class. As a result, he got straight As on many subjects. She regarded her class as a family and they even had their own class song. She would often have them sing it to encourage them and develop a team spirit for them. When she saw that they were no longer listening carefully to what she was teaching, she would have them close their textbooks, stand up all around the room and throw around a small football. This helped them clear their minds and then _ the lesson again. Besides, she was quick to reply to any phone calls or emails from us and got rid of our worries about children quickly.\nWhen my son went to the 5thgrade this year, we happened to pass her classroom. When she saw my son, her face lit up  and she came out and hugged him. She generally loves all of the children in her classroom and that love really shows. I can only pray  that my son will continue to get teachers just like her for the rest of his school years.", "id": "high2497.txt"}
