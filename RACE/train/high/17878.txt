Perhaps you see yourself as a lawyer, businessman, or even a scientist. Whatever it is, don't let it die.\n  A dream is a wonderful thing. It can give your hope for your future and encourage you to try when all odds are against you.\n  However, there are dream killers that want to kill your dream. People who don't want to see your dream fulfilled can destroy your dream. They may tell you that it is impossible for you, that you are not smart enough or that it's never been done before. However, many times the biggest dream killer is you.\n  Don't let fear, doubt or lack of finances prevent you from fulfilling your dream. Talk back to these killers, \" I can and will fulfill my dream.\" You may have to do this every day. The more you instill  within your heart that you can do it, the more safely your dream will be held within you. \n  It is very important to take steps towards fulfilling your dream. For me, in order to fulfill my dream of one-day owning my own magazine, I needed to go back to school and finish my college degree. For you, it may be something different you know deep inside what the voice of your dream calls for. Don't be afraid and just do it. Try not to let too much time go by. Time is another one of those dream killers.\n  Think about the words of a song by Yolanda Adams, \" Keep the dream alive, don't let it die, if something deep inside keeps inspiring you to try, don't stop. And never give up, don't ever give up on you. Sometimes, life can place a stumbling block in you way. But you gotta to keep the faith.\n  When you dream, dream big and never give up. Your dream is just yours. Never let anyone tell you that your dream can't happen--- it can! Nurture  your dream. Keep seeing yourself do what's never been done before. As you continue to feed your dream and protect it, not only will you keep it alive, but it will come true.", "id": "high17878.txt"}
