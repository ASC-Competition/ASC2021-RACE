So far seven different kinds of animals have already successfully been cloned, including sheep, cats and most recently rabbits.\n         Doctors showed their doubt and were strongly opposed although they admitted that human cloning would finally come true unless there was a worldwide ban on the practice.\n         Professor Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, \"I find it astonishing that people do this where the result can be foretold that it will not be a normal baby. It is using humans as guinea pigs . It makes people feel sick.\"\n         But Ronald Green, director of the Ethics Institute at Darmouth College in the USA, said it is unlikely that an eight-week-old pregnancy would lead to a birth.\n         So far all cloned animals have suffered from some different serious disorders, many of them dying soon after their birth.\n         Doctors are opposed to  human cloning because they are worried about the welfare of the cloned child if there is one. \"There are no benefits of cloned human beings, just harm,\" said Dr. Michael Wilks of the U.K.", "id": "high22841.txt"}
