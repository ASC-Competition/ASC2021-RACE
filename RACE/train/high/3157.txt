The Chinese Yellow Sea Wetlands are among them. They are in Yancheng,Jiangsu Province. They are home of many different kinds of birds and animals. The world's largest Milu Deer Nature Reserve  is in them. More than 700 milu deer live freely there.\nThe temperature in the wetlands is usually neither too high nor too low. There is a lot of rain and sunshine,too. They are really good places for wildlife. Offering food and home for some special kinds of animals and birds is not the only reason why we need to protect wetlands.\nWetlands are important because they also prevent flood. But some people want to change the wetlands to make more space for farms and buildings. This means there will be less and less space for wildlife.\nLuckily, more and more people are beginning to realize the important of wetlands and wildlife. Every year, on February 2nd many activities are held to tell people more about wetlands around the world.", "id": "high3157.txt"}
