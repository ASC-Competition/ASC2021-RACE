Now, thanks to the Web, it is expanding to include far-away farmers too. A new start-up, Foodzie, is an online farmers market where small food producers and growers can sell their products.\nFoodzie was started by Mr LaFave and two of his friends, who met during college at Virginia Tech, where they would pay frequent visits to farmers markets. Last year, while living in North Carolina, one of them, Emily Olson, now 24, came up with one idea. She was working as a brand manager for a _ grocery chain and realized that people who enjoyed fine food but didn't work in the business had no way to discover handmade foods outside their local farmers markets. Small farmers had no way of finding or selling to faraway customers, either.\nMr LaFAve and the third co-founder, Nik Bauman, both 25, worked in corporate sales and software development. \"With business, food and computer science backgrounds, we figured we had everything we needed.\" Mr LaFAve said.\nThe three quit their jobs, and opened this site to the public in December and the site has had 43,000 visitors in the past month. So far, 29 sellers have opened shops and 41 are in the process of opening them. The founders recently hired a fourth employee to help Ms Olson recruit  new food producers at farmers markets and food shows. Mr LaFAve is convinced that the recession  will not reduce people's interest in buying locally grown and handmade food. \"There is misunderstanding that all these foods are more expensive than mass-produced alternatives,\" he said. \"People are pouring their heart and soul into these products, and they are of the highest quality.\"", "id": "high5304.txt"}
