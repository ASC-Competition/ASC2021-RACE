The people are unfriendly, it's way too expensive, and the food is terrible - so why do so many tourists flock   there?\nLondon was named the world's most popular city between July and September 2013. It _ other world-famous cities such as New York and Paris, welcoming 4.9 million visitors, according to the UK Office for National Statistics.\nAmazingly, this was an increase of almost 19.5 percent on 2012 - the year when the Olympics happened in summer.\nSo can London's success be explained? Well, maybe. As the English writer Samuel Johnson once said, \"when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life\". London life is often crazy and expensive, but if you can think of something, you can probably do it there.\nAnywhere in the city, you can often look around a great museum such as the British Museum, watch a concert at a historic venue   like the Royal Albert Hall, or dance the night away in a cool nightclub such as Fabric.\nAnd it's not just about culture - there are also world-famous sporting venues around the city. Many tourists like to watch soccer matches at stadiums such as Chelsea's Stamford Bridge, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium, or Tottenham's White Hart Lane. Tourists even came to watch British tennis player Andy Murray's famous victory at the Wimbledon tennis tournament   in 2013.\nYes, but what about the food? Well, even if you don't like British food - and if you've never had real fish and chips, or a summer pudding, then perhaps you should wait until you've tried them - there is plenty of great food from all over the world available in London's many restaurants.\nLondon, like many of its buildings, has a long history, but also never lacks a vibrant pulse  . All over the city, history and modernity come together to make it an essential place for tourists to discover.", "id": "high8211.txt"}
