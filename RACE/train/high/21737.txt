Less important than ever is developing a meaningful philosophy of life.\" It follows then that today the most popular course is not literature or history but accounting.\nInterest in teaching, social service and the \"altruistic\" fields is at a low. On the other hand, enrollment in business programs, engineering and computer science is way up.\nWhile it's true that we all need a career, it is equally true that our civilization has accumulated an incredible amount of knowledge in scientific or artistic fields. It is equally true that, in studying the diverse wisdom of others, we learn how to think.

The most important argument for a broad education is that in studying the accumulated wisdom of the ages, we improve our moral sense. I saw a cartoon recently which shows a group of businessmen looking puzzled as they sit around a conference table; one of them is talking on the intercom  :\"Miss Baxter,\" he says, \"could you please send in someone who can distinguish right from wrong?\"\nFrom the long term point of view, that's what education really ought to be about.", "id": "high21737.txt"}
