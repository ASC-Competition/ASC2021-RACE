Here are two of the cities listed as \"the world's best.\"\nSAN JOSE, COSTA RICA  The city has comfortable weather all year round (15degC to 26degC ). Housing is not very expensive in San Jose. Also, many of the city's older neighborhoods are very beautiful and have small hotels and cafes . Beautiful mountains are around the city. You can visit them easily from San Jose. So lots of people go sightseeing there every year. But air pollution is a problem in the city center.\nHONG KONG, CHINA This lively city--once a small fishing village--is today an international business center. It is an interesting mixof East and West, old and new. Modern tall buildings are next to small temples  . Popular nightclubs are close to traditional teahouses. Busy people fill the streets at all hours of the day. But outside the city, there are parks for walking or relaxing. Hong Kong is famous for its wonderful native dishes. There's also food from Europe, North America, and other parts of Asia. However, this small city has a large population. Nearly 7 million people live in Hong Kong! That's why housing is often very expensive. Traffic and air pollution are also a problem.", "id": "high3566.txt"}
