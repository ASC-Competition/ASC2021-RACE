A dealer once said Graham was the type who would never be able to turn back and that he expected him to die from the drug. Wendy feared the same, but didn't know how to save her son. \" Once, after he'd disappeared for more than a month, I found him at a friend's house with a bunch of other users,\" she said, \"I got down on my hands and knees, begging him to come home. He did, but the next morning he was gone. I don't know what made him do it, but I drove 20 miles to the nearest train station. Graham was headed for Seattle, his pockets full of drugs. If I hadn't gotten there in time, I would never have seen him alive again.\"\nThe turning point came in 2007, after Graham was arrested yet again for possession. Wendy got a call from the Montana Drugs Project, which works with local law enforcement  to keep track of youth-related crimes so it can help families in trouble. Following a counselor's advice, Wendy hired two men to come to her home in the middle of the night, tie Graham and take him to a treatment program in Thompson Falls, Montana. \"I was high when they came and really angry with my mom,\" he said, \"But if she hadn't done that, drugs would have killed me.\" After six months of treatment, Graham, now 19, came back to Kalispell, where he's grown close to Wendy once again. \"I still have the desires every day and attend support meetings every night,\" he said, \"But life is worth living again. My mom thinks that's a miracle. I guess she is right.\"", "id": "high9449.txt"}
