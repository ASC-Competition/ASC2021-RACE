So why not give awards to kids?\nHarry Leibowitz asked himself that question in 1996. As an answer, he and his wife, Kay, created the World of Children organization and began handing out awards to kids and adults whose work has helped kids all over the world. The awards the World of Children presents arenicknamed(......)the \" Children's Nobel Prize\".\n\"You know, children are so important,\" Leibowitz, a retired business manager, told me. \" We should have prizes for children if we're going to have prizes for everything else.\"\nTalia Leman, from Iowa, was awarded a Founder's Youth Award for Leadership this year. She is only 13 years old, but she has completed a lot. In 2005, she founded \" RandomKid\". Since then, it has raised more than$10 million to help kids in 48 states in the U.S. and in 19 other countries.\nOne place helped by RandomKid was a school built in Cambodia to enable 300 kids to go to school. The organization has also helped fix a school for 200 kids in Louisiana, and provided interactive play centers that serve more than 500 kids in hospitals in Iowa. In faraway places like Africa, RandomKid has provided money to buywater pumps .\nTalia never thought that the organization she founded would be as successful as it has become. She said, \" My first goal was to raise $1million. That seemed really high, but when you reach a goal, you always wind up reaching higher, and we actually raised $10 million.\"\nI asked her what advice she would offer to other young people who want to help kids in need. \" Well, I'd say the first thing would be to find an adult and tell them your idea,\" Talia said. \" They're really the people who can help, and from there I think it can just really take off.\"", "id": "high10667.txt"}
