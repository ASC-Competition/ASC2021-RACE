So far the month-long test of the new system has gone smoothly.\nFor your convenience, we have included a copy of the envelope below to allow you to record the days you have ordered lunch for your child. You can keep this copy at home for your reference.\nPlease note, lunches are prepared using the School Food Guidelines both in terms of items served and size. During the first two weeks some people wrote in additions to the menu, such as ordering extra items. Due to the logistics   involved and our limited volunteer base we are unable to fulfill these requests. \nOrdering process:\nThis year we will distribute a two week lunch envelope. If you decide to order the meal offered on a given day, simply check the box in front of that meal choice. For example, if you choose seven meals over the two weeks, then please enclose (7 x $2.00) fourteen dollars ($14.00) in the envelope. Seal it, and return it to your child's teacher. Please note that the cost for the lunch remains the same: $2.00 daily and includes fruit and milk.\nYou will note that we have also reduced daily choices. For example on Fridays, we offered chicken burgers and hamburgers. This has been changed to chicken burgers on one week and hamburgers the following week. Food prepared according to special requests has also been changed. These items will now be prepared with the same ingredients.\nIf your child does not like the lunch being served on a particular day please ensure that he/she has a packed lunch from home.\nThank you for your attention on this matter and we look forward to working with you once again this year.\nPlease return the attached envelopes by Thursday, December 2, 2011.", "id": "high23953.txt"}
