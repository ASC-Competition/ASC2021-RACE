Faust is an excellent historian known especially for her work on the history of the American South. She was a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania for 25 years. In 2001, she became dean   of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard. \n       Born in 1947, Faust grew up in a traditional family. She has often spoken of her \"continued confrontations  \" with her mother \"about the requirements of what she usually called femininity  \". Her mother used to tell her, \"It's a man's world, sweetie. And the sooner you learn that, the better off you'll be.\"  \n       However, the daughter was a rebellious one. For example, Faust would fight with her mother over whether it was suitable for her to drive a car at night, even if one of her three brothers was a passenger. \"She was raised to be a rich man's wife,\" said a friend, Elizabeth Warren. \"Instead she becomes the president of the most powerful university in the world.\" \n       As a girl, Faust rebelled against not only the strict rules of femininity, but also the racial injustice that existed in her native Virginia. At age 9, after a conversation with her family's black handyman   and driver, she sent a letter to President Dwight D. Eisenhower decrying   racial injustice. When studying in Bryn Mawr, a women's college in Pennsylvania, she was a student activist who would go on to march in the civil rights protests   in the 1960s.  \n       What would her mother, who never went to college and died in 1966, have to say about her appointment? \"I've often thought about that,\" she said. \"I've had dialogues with my dead mother over the 40 years since she died.\"", "id": "high20436.txt"}
