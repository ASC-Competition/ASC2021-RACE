They study hard and do extremely well on achievement tests. And next year,Rowena will be attending Harvard University.Billy,her younger brother,hopes to go to Cornell.What makes Rowena and Billy different from most students is that they don't go to school.In fact,they've never been to school.Since kindergarten,they've studied at home.Like many of more than one million people who receive home schooling in the United States, they feel as if they've gotten a good education.\nThe home-schooling trend began in the U.S.in the 1980s with parents keeping their children out of public schools so they could provide religious education at home. Today,as the home-schooling trend continues to grow,parents are more likely to consider home schooling as an option because they believe schools don't do a very good job of teaching and are occasionally dangerous places.But can parents really do a better job?\nThe answer in many cases is yes.In many studies,students taught at home ranked average or above average when compared to students who went to public schools.More importantly,these students were often more self-directed and have a greater depth of knowledge.They were well prepared for academic challenges.\nOne such student,Robert Conrad, now a sophomore at university, claims he really learned how to study and schedule his time during his eight years of home schooling.Still, not every student is as successful as Robert.\n\"For every home-schooling success story,there are an equal number of failures.\"states Henry Lipscomb,an educational researcher.\"There are just so many disadvantages that students taught at home have to overcome.\" For example,they have fewer chances to get in touch with others of their own age.Consequently,they sometimes lack the usual social skills.\"No matter what,though,\"states Lipscomb,\"home-schooling is a growing trend.I think we'll be seeing more and more of this.\"", "id": "high1660.txt"}
