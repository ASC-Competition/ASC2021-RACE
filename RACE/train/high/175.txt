When I left home for the office where I worked in the next town, the weather forecasters said, \"Windy and cold, but no rain.\" However, by the time I was about to leave work in the early evening, it was pouring!\nMy office was close to the bus stop so that there was no problem; I just shot out the door and onto the bus. Unfortunately, once I got home to Montrose, I had about a mile to walk from the bus stop to my home.\nAs I stepped off the bus that night to walk home, I struggled to get my tiny umbrella to go up in the strong wind. It was obviously designed for a very light shower. Then, suddenly and to my amazement, I heard my mum's voice.\n\"Quickly! Come under here, before you get soaked! \"\nI nipped  under my bigger umbrella and stared at mum in surprise. \"What on earth are you doing here in this weather?\" I asked her. My mum was eighty-three that year, and although fit and healthy, she did not usually like going out in strong wind and heavy rain. \"You said to come round for tea tonight, but I came early before the rain got too heavy. Eric told me that your car was in for a service and I saw your big umbrella lying on the chair. Eric was on the phone, so I just picked it up and came out so that I could meet you and you would not get soaked!''\nMy mum passed away the following year. This simple act remains in my mind, and reminds me how completely my mum loved me. She would not have gone out in the wind and rain for herself, but, at eighty-three, she never gave a second thought about the bad weather so I would not get wet.", "id": "high175.txt"}
