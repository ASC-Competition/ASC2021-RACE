But at nearly nine stone (1stone equals 6.35 kilograms), the 11-year-old was too big to enjoy her favorite sport, she was well on her way to being another overweight member of her family. Mandy, her mum was 17th 10 lb and Anne, her grandma 15th 10 lb.  \nMandy, 39, and Anne, 67, both have a sweet tooth and share a love of all things stodgy. Recent figures show that two-thirds of kids will be dangerously fat by 2050, and overweight kids often become obese adults and live shorter lives as they are at higher risk of everything from heart disease to cancer and type-2 diabetes. Mandy says she knew things had to change for her and her family. Mandy's mum Anne had an even greater motivation for wanting to slim down. Last autumn Paige went along to the Slimming World to keep her mum and grand ma company. In the first week on the Slimming World eating plan, Mandy lost a whopping 9.5lb. Mandy asked Paige to join in. They believed the Free2Go plan is balanced and nutritious and doesn't deprive Paige of anything.  \nSupporting and encouraging each other the whole time, Anne, Mandy and Paige all whittled away their waistlines. Mandy says: \"My back problems have cleared up.\" Anne has also noticed a real difference in her health. She says: \"I feel like I've got my old energy back.\" Paige is almost as delighted with her new wardrobe as she is about her foot balling skills. Mandy adds: \"I'm just so proud of Paige. I felt awful because I knew her weight problems were a result of my bad eating habits. But when I see her now it's like she's a different person.\"", "id": "high23355.txt"}
