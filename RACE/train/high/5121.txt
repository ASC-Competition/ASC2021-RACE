The time was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and I was driving along the road to take my daughter from school. Our plan was to go swimming together. I had finished my work at 4 o'clock and then gone to the Post Office. Then I'd stopped off at a shop in order to get some fresh fruit. We like to have some fruit to eat after our swim.\nI was driving along a high road on my way to my daughter's school. Over my road was another road which was built like a bridge for cars coming to the other way. I was hungry so I put the bag of apples in the seat beside me and started to eat one.\nSuddenly I saw the cars in front of me start to move from side to side. Then my car started to shake! I didn't know what was happening. Perhaps something had gone wrong with my car. I drove a little more slowly and then I stopped the car and at the same moment the road fell onto the cars in front of me.\nI found myself in the dark. I couldn't move. The bottom parts of both of my legs and my feet were hurting badly and I couldn't move them. All around me was quiet. But above me I could hear shouts and a lot of noise. Then I memorized   what had happened. I had been in an earthquake.\nFor about two hours nobody came. Luckily I could reach the bag of apples, so at least I had plenty to eat. Then I heard people climbing towards me. A team of people had come to see if anyone was under the broken road. I called out. \"I'm here!\" I heard a shout. Soon a stranger climbed to the side of the road near my car. \"How are you doing?\" he asked.\n\"Not too bad,\" I said, \"but my feet and leg feel as if they're broken.\" \"We'll have you out of there just as soon as we can.\" They didn't get me out until the next morning. I had been in my car for fourteen hours.", "id": "high5121.txt"}
