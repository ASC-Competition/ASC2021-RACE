The benefits to them and us as parents and teachers are quite amazing-harmony, peace and love.\nWhen I left my last school where I had been a casual  for eight years, I received \"thank you\" notes from the students. I think these notes illustrate what teenagers want and need from their parents and teachers.\nSome of the notes mention kindness, patience, thoughtfulness, encouragement and fun. Teenagers value these qualities and what I found was that the more I relaxed and enjoyed their company, the less I had to discipline them.\nBelow I've included a few excerpts from the notes to let the kids speak for themselves. These are teenagers speaking from the heart and show what, according to teenagers, they need and value.\nEach note began, \"Thank you for...\"\n* making each student in the school happy\n* putting up with us every time you get us (i.e. having patience)\n* Always giving every student a chance and treating everyone like an adult giving lots\nof merits and making every lesson fun and enjoyable\n* Being very kind & for giving me lots of (merit) stickers\n* You make working be fun\n* Being a patient and thoughtful teacher\nPatience is needed as well as kindness, thoughtfulness, a sense of humor and fun and the ability to listen more than talk.\nWhen we praise and value our teenagers, the results are nothing short of miraculous.", "id": "high9162.txt"}
