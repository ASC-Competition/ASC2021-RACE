As the first generation to grow up in a wired world, they hardly know a time when computers weren't around, and they eagerly catch the chance to spend hours online, chatting with friends. So what?\nBut researchers nationwide are increasingly worried that teens are becoming isolated  , less skillful at person-to-person relationships , and perhaps numb   to the cheatings that are so much a part of the e-mail world . \"And a teen's sense of self and values may be changed in a world where personal connections can be limitless,\" said Sherry Turkle .\nAnother researcher , Robert Kraut , said he's worried about the \"opportunity costs\"  of so much online time for youths . He found that teens who used computers, even just a few hours a week, showed increased signs of loneliness and social isolation. \"Chatting online may be better than watching television , but it's worse than hanging out   with real friends,\" he said .\nToday's teens, however, don't see anything strange in the fact that the computer takes up a central place in their social lives. \"School is busy and full of pressure. There's almost no time to just hang out,\" said Parker Rice, 17. \"Talking online is just catch-up time.\"\nTeens say they feel good about what they say online or taking the time to think about a reply.
