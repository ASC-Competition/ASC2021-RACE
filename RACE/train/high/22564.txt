Do you ever stop to wonder why \nyou're going? \n*Relax. You're making the right decision. First of all, you'll discover what interests you by taking \ncourses in many subjects. For example, it's hard to decide if you want to be a painter if you've never \npainted any pictures; once you're in a drawing-room on campus, you'll know one way or the other. \nCollege is also a lot of fun--after you graduate, you'll be working every weekday for 50 or so years. \nAnd remember that college graduate earn about twice the income of those who never attended college. \n*Finding the right college can be difficult. Fortunately, Johnson Review is here to help you every \nstep of the way. \n*Researching Schools.

On JohnsonReview.com., you'll find hundreds of actual college applications\nand links to many more. \n*Raising Your Scores.

But, if you can do better, find the right course for better scores. \n*Paying for School. Most families need financial aid for the high cost of college. The problem is \nthat financial aid seems difficult to get and many families get caught up in the price of college rather than learning the ways to get financial aid. If you really do your research, you'll learn that you can afford to attend any college, no matter the cost. \nFor more information, call 600-3681 or visit JohnsonReview.com.Wherever you go, have a nice trip!\nJohnson Smith \nFounder and CEO\nJohnson Review", "id": "high22564.txt"}
