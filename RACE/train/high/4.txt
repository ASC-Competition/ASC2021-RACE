It has borrowed words from many other languages. Immigrants  coming into the United States have contributed many words to the language, which have kept their original pronunciation. \"Coolie\" and \"kowtow\" were taken from the Chinese language, \"kamikaze from the Japanese, \"shampoo\" from India, \"blitz\" from German, \"amigo\" and \"Los Angeles\" from Spanish and so on.\nMany students have studied English for years, some as many as eight. However, some students still have difficulty in speaking fluent English. Some know many words but are unable to _ them when native speakers use them. In our Oral English classes we will focus on speaking and listening to native English speakers. For this reason, because we are trying to train your ears to hear English and your mouths to speak intelligible   English, we will have a rule that ONLY ENGLISH will be spoken in our English classes. Anyone speaking Chinese in class will be required to pay a fine in order to encourage the speaking and understanding of English. If teachers enter a classroom and discover that anyone is speaking Chinese, they will require everyone in the room to pay the fine. It is everyone's job to enforce the English-Only rule. It is for your benefit. It is because we want to accustom   your ears to hearing English.\nOther subjects may be learned solely from books but the only way to learn a foreign language is to SPEAK IT! Students are often nervous about speaking in class at first but we hope to make the classes fun, so you will forget your nervousness and learn to speak out. Enjoy your classes.", "id": "high4.txt"}
