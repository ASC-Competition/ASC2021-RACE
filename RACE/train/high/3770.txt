Her worst fears raced through her mind. Would the court tell her she couldn't care for her family anymore? Would the kids go through the sadness once more of being split up and sent away? She was so young, almost a child herself, and yet Amy knew everything depended on her. At that moment, she wondered if she would ever find the strength to see it through.\nFrom earliest childhood, Amy took care of her younger brothers. Jan, their mother, only added to the family disorder and confusion because of her drug addict. Sometimes they lived in apartments, sometimes in shelters.\nOne afternoon Amy was called to the high school, where a social worker was waiting for her. \"We're going to have to put you guys in foster  care.\" the social worker said. \"No! Don't spilt us up!\" the girl cried out. \"Can't you just leave it the way it is?\" The social worker shook his head. Amy's voice then rose like the howl of a lion protecting her babies: \"Why can't I take them? I take care of them all the time anyway.\" The social worker hesitated, and then said, \"Maybe. Once you're 18, you could apply to become their relative caretaker. Then you'd be their foster mother until we find a home where all of you can be together.\" \"I'll do it,\" Amy said.\nOne month later, Amy was named _ of her brothers for a six-month trial period. It was a remarkable victory for an 18-year-old girl. Her brothers didn't make her task any easier in the months ahead. However,Amy's efforts were rewarded when the court allowed her to continue as guardian. Amy's relief at remaining the kids' guardian was at risk of being taken away by the pressure she always\nfelt to measure up. Social workers still looked regularly over her shoulder and asked the boys shameful\nquestions: \"Does she feed you? Does she ever try to harm you?\" Then one day a visiting social worker\ncame over. \"We'd like to get the boys adopted into homes,\" she said. Sensing that the family was about to be split apart yet again, Amy replied, \"Fine, then. Call it adoption if you want, but they're not going anywhere.\" To her surprise, the social worker took her remark seriously. She explained that if Amy were to adopt the boys, they would become like any other family.\nThat night at dinner Amy told the boys about the idea. \"Cool!\" Joey said. He threw a piece of corn at Adam. His brother flicked it back, and pretty soon corn was flying. Amy rolled her eyes. _ As the proceedings ended, Amy thanked everyone. \"No,\" the judge responded, \"Thank you. You saved three kids. Not many family members would do what you're doing, especially for this many children. I'm very proud of you.\"\nOn a lazy spring day, in a modest suburban neighborhood, Amy stood in front of a neatly kept one-story house. She watched her brothers playing basketball, and heard the playful bark of their dog, Tahoe. The young lady had made good on her promise: they had rented a home, a real home, and the boys had gotten their dog. Amy continues to raise her family alone, but has begun taking courses in business management at a nearby community college. Eventually, she hopes to become a child psychologist.", "id": "high3770.txt"}
