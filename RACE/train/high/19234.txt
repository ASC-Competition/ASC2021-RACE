These loud animals are rarely seen, but as temperatures begin to rise in March and April, the males certainly are heard. Their peep...peep... peep creates an other-worldly whistling sound that, to many, is the first sign of spring, compared with that of some birds.\nSpring peepers are brown in color1 with dark lines that form an X on their backs. They grow to about 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) in length, and have large special toes for climbing. These creatures are active at night, coming out to feed on ants, beetles, flies, and spiders.\nWhen the warmer weather arrives, male frogs attempt to attract a mate with a spring song. The frogs normally perform in singing. The one who starts each round usually has the deepest voice. The \"vocal sacs\" under their mouths allow the frogs to \"sing\". They fill their vocal sacs with air until they look like a balloon, and then they let out a \"peep\" as they release the air. They \"peep\" about once every second. These sounds can often be heard as far as a half-mile away\nAfter a female and male peeper mate, the female lays her eggs in water and spends the remainder of the year in the forest. During the winter, they sleep under logs or behind loose bark on trees. The music dies down during the cold months, but the sounds of peepers will soon be heard again, sounding the coming of spring.", "id": "high19234.txt"}
