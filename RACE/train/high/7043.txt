Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. The beginnings of modem dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed.\nHer search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea. Her great contributions are in three areas.\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movements that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concerts.  In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity   shown by complicated, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using all her body in the freest possible way.  Her dance stemmed from   her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\nHer second contribution lies in dance costumes  . She discarded corset, ballet shoes, and stiff costumes.  These were replaced with flowing clothes, bare feet, and unlimited hair.  She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\nHer third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies   of great masters, including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.\nShe was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance.", "id": "high7043.txt"}
