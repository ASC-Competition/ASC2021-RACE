However, a new ecological PC saves energy as it operates:it produces about 70   percent less CO2than conventional computers.\nAs a work tool, a leisure activity resource, and a personal assistant, computers seem to be   everywhere. Yet the environmental performance for today's computers leaves a lot to be   improved: they rapidly become out of date, and typically contain poisonous materials and   individual parts that are difficult to recycle. Moreover, they consume plenty of power whose   production, in return, causes the release of CO2into the atmosphere.\nEmployees at the MicroPro Company in Ireland, teaming with colleagues at the Fraunhofer Institute for Reliability and Microintegration IZM in Berlin, have engineered a wooden--frame computer with reduced environment impact. As the first computer for its class, the\"iameco\"(pronounced I-am-eco) was awarded the \"EU Ecolabel\", the European Union's environmental label. \"This touch-screen PC has very low energy consumption over the entire lifecycle\" explains Alexander Schlosser, scientist at IZM.\nOver the full product life cycle, it releases 70 percent less CO2than a typical desktop PC   with monitor. In addition, it can be easily recycled. Of the materials used, 98 percent can be   recycled. Indeed, 20 percent of the computer can be reused immediately--in other words, many parts can be reused for repairing other computers--such as parts of the wooden frame.", "id": "high8376.txt"}
