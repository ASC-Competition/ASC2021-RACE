He continued as a robber day after day and year after year. \n    One day, Ian went to rob a traveler. Unlike those who have been robbed by him before, the traveler showed no fear and asked, \"Why do you do this every day?\" Ian was surprised and answered without thinking, \"Because I have a family. Robbing is the only way I can earn money to support my family.\" \"Are your family members prepared to share your punishment with you?\" Ian was puzzled and said he didn't know. The traveler told him to go home and ask them. \n    Ian asked his wife, \"Do you know how I work to support you?\" His wife replied, \"Yes, I know.\" Ian asked, \"Are you going to share the punishment I'll get for the way I earn my living?\" His wife answered, \"No. You married me and you should take care of me.\"\n    Next, his parents replied, \"Son, we raised you with great care. Now we don't have the energy to work. So it's your duty to look after us. We won't share any of the punishments placed upon you for what you've done.\" \n    Ian hadn't expected their answers. He became sad and returned to the traveler. Ian told him all the conversations. The traveler said, \"You have to take the consequences yourself.\" Ian thanked him for letting him see the errors in his ways. After this incident, Ian started learning in order to work and support the family in legal ways.", "id": "high17767.txt"}
