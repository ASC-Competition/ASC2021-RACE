They can be taught to do things. That is really interesting.\nOnce upon a time there was an elephant near a town in India. The elephant went to work with its master every day. It had to go along a certain street. A tailor lived in this street, and used to sit at the door of his shop. Every day when the elephant came to this shop, it would stop and put out its trunk towards the tailor. This was because it knew that the tailor was a friendly man. He would give it something nice to eat.\nOne day it happened that the tailor had nothing to give to his big friend. Perhaps he wanted to make fun of it, because he was not an unkind man. What did he do? When the elephant put out its trunk to the tailor, he pricked   the end of the trunk with a needle. The elephant drew back quickly, looked at him angrily and went off down the road.\nThe tailor thought no more about it during the day, but the elephant did! That evening before it went home the elephant filled its trunk with water from a dirty pond. When the tailor saw it coming along the road, he laughed at the trick that he had played on the beast that morning. But he became very sad when he received a trunkful of dirty water between the eyes!", "id": "high21095.txt"}
