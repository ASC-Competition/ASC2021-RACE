The standard bulbs we use only contribute to higher electricity bills and more carbon dioxide.If you switch at least some of your standard bulbs with the compact fluorescent bulbs,you can save the environment while saving on your electric bill.\nRecycling is also an excellent way to save our environment.Try to buy as many products as you can that can be recycled.The less trash that has to be burned or buried into our soil,the better off our planet will be.\nThese small changes may seem that they couldn't help much for the environment,but they can help tremendously.Every little bit we do is a much-needed step toward reserving natural resources for our future generations.", "id": "high17326.txt"}
