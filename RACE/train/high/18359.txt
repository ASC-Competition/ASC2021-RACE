The countryside aroundStratfordis pleasant, with its beautiful woods, green fields and quiet rivers. \nThe first place we visited was the house in the center of Stratfordwhere Shakespeare was born. We saw the small desk that Shakespeare sat at when he went to school. One of the things we liked best was the garden behind the house, because we could see there many of the flowers, trees and plants that Shakespeare wrote about in his plays. \nAfter we had visited Shakespeare's birthplace, we went to see the church where he was buried. \nWe had lunch in a very old hotel that was probably there in Shakespeare's time. Every room of the hotel had the name of one of Shakespeare's plays on the door--the \"Hamlet\" room, the \"Romeo and Juliet\" room, and so on. \nAfter lunch we walked across the fields to the old cottage, about a mile out of Stratford, where Shakespeare spent most of his married life. The cottage is just as it was in Shakespeare's day. We saw the chairs where Shakespeare perhaps sat and thought about ideas for new plays, and we saw the plates from which he probably ate his dinner. \nWhen we got back to our hotel that evening, we were tired, but we had enjoyed a wonderful day.", "id": "high18359.txt"}
