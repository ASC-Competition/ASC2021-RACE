At the lowest end are Mexico, Brazil and Indonesia.\nThese _ draw upon tests that are taken every three or four years, in areas such as maths, science and literacy - and so present a picture lagging by several years.\nLooking at education systems that succeed, the study concludes that spending is important, but not as much as having a culture that is supportive of learning.\nIt says that spending is easier to measure, but the more complex impact of a society's attitude to education can make a big difference.\nThe success of Asian countries in these rankings reflects the high value attached to education and the expectations of parents. This can continue to be a factor when families migrate to other countries, says the report.\nLooking at the two top countries - Finland and South Korea - the report says that there are many big differences, but the common factor is a shared social belief in the importance of education and its \"underlying moral purpose\".", "id": "high2045.txt"}
