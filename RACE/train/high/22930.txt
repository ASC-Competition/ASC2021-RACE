There is one located on our street and it has just been completely rebuilt. I told her that they helped people book their trips and vacations. \"Why haven't we ever been there?' she wanted to know. \"Because we do everything ourselves online these days.\" I explained. \"But why do you do it yourself if other people want to do it for you?\" she wondered out loud.\nThe answer is that the travel agency makes a little bit of money on each ticket you book through them. If you book your ticket yourself online, you save that money. Saving money sounds great except that when you think about it you typically spend three evenings comparing prices to end up saving EUR30 on a EUR300 trip. All those EUR30 discounts add up of course so I guess we should be happy with that. Consider books for a moment. Buying your book at Amazon saves you 30% to 40% on each book. Add to that the convenience of shopping from home and getting the package delivered to your home address. So far so good. Unfortunately, that does mean you spend too much time browsing Amason.com while you could do something fun instead. Like maybe reading an actual book?\nThen the package arrives and you aren't home and end up having to pick it up at the local post-office. All in all I wonder how much time I end up investing in the whole process. Time sounds free, but to most of us, it is more valuable than money.\nThe Internet Economy promised to get rid of the middle-men and we loved it. Somehow, I'm starting to get the feeling that we ourselves ended up doing the work of the middle-men we were so eager to get rid of.\nIn any project you can always pick two of these: fast, cheap or good. We seem to have focused a lot on \"cheap\" and \"good\" but the extra time we need to invest to also keep it \"fast\" comes out of our own pockets.\nYour can always make more money, but you can never make more time.", "id": "high22930.txt"}
