Experts at the first Chinese Students Nutrition and Health Festival in Kunming last week listed eight bad eating habits.\n*Watching television while having meals or snacks.\nDoing this means you don't pay attention to your food, forget how full you are, and so overeat. It can also cause digestion   diseases. One way to avoid this is only to eat in certain areas of your home.\n* Replacing meals with snacks.\nMany students think that eating small snacks can help them diet. But it often results in overeating and health problems related to a lack of vegetables, carbohydrates  ,proteins and vitamins. Snacking only works if it is well planned and includes healthy foods such as nuts, vegetables, fruit and yogurt.\n*Having drinks rather than water.\nFizzy   drinks and fruit juice are usually high in calories and sugar, which can\ncause weight problems. Water is important in making your brain cells and every organ in your body work properly. For your body to burn fat, it needs at least eight glasses of pure water a day. Liquids like soda and coffee actually take water away from your body.\n*Refusing to drink milk.\nMilk is the best natural food--it provides you with protein, which makes your bones strong and teeth healthy.\n* Choosing meat and certain vegetables over others.\nDifferent foods provide different kinds of nutrition. If you don't have a balanced diet, this can result in malnutrition   and a weaker body.\n*Eating in front of the computer and staying there after meals.\nTake a walk after eating and it helps your stomach digest the meal.\n*Buying from roadside snack bars.\nIf you shop at these places, be careful--many are not clean enough.\n* Eating throat tablets as if they were sweets.\nIf you eat throat tablets when you have no throat disease, they may affect the bacteria in your mouth and cause real throat problems.", "id": "high9361.txt"}
