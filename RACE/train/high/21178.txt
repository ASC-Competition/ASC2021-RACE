Most people are the victim of an uncontrollable fit of laughter at least once in their lives. But when it happens in front of the television cameras, it can become an internet sensation.\nDo you think there's anything funny about spicy meat? Swiss finance minister Hans-Rudolf Merz seemed to think it was hilarious. Mr. Merz was making a speech in the Swiss parliament on meat imports when he started laughing and couldn't stop. The meat in question is known as \"bundnerfleisch\"-- a type of air-dried beef product. Herr Merz later admitted that he was amused by the bureaucratic  language in which the bill was written.\nSince then, Mr. Merz has become an internet hit. A video of the incident shows a grey-suited minister giggling away, accompanied by applause from his parliamentary colleagues. So far, the video has been seen by more than 500,000 people on YouYube and other websites. \"I don't understand what he's talking about,\" said one viewer, \"but it's just so funny.\" The recent publicity will be good news for the minister, too. Mr. Merz had been criticized recently for signing away much of Switzerland's banking secrecy, and for failing to do enough to help two Swiss citizens who were detained by Libya. But now, with retirement a few months away, Mr. Merz may leave on a high note. Some even suggest he may have a future career as a comedian.\nOf course, Mr. Merz isn't the first person to  _ on air. BBC Radio 4 newsreader Charlotte Green lost control on the programmeTodaynot so long ago. It all happened after a clip of the oldest known recording of the human voice was played. A studio member remarked that the 1860 recording of a woman singing the French song \"Au Clair de la Lune\" sounded like a \"bee buzzing in a bottle\". That seemed to set Ms. Green off as she broke down into a fit of the giggles. Later, the editor of the show, Ceri Thomas, said most listeners who contacted the show had commented on \"how much they had enjoyed the moment\". He added, \"When Charlotte loses it, she really loses it.\"\nSo, why do we get these fits of laughter? Experts say it's a form of release. Nervous tension often builds up inside us, especially in those who have got high-pressure, stressful jobs. When stressed out, the body constricts  blood vessels, elevates the production of potentially damaging stress hormones, and raises blood pressure. Short periods of stress are normal and not dangerous, but over long periods of time stress weakens the immune system and makes heart problems more likely. Under the control ofself-protecting mechanisms of human body, this pressure needs an outlet, usually manifesting itself through tears, anger or laughter-- uncontrollable fits of laughter!\nSo, beware! That uncontrollable laughing fit could strike at any moment.\n[(<<>> 201102 \"Laugh Away\")]", "id": "high21178.txt"}
