In all , 12 American astronauts have walked on the moon , the last - Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt - doing so in 1972 .\nEnthusiasm for space travel has always decreased and increased . In 2010 , President Barack Obama cut funds for a NASA mission that would have put humans back on the moon by 2020 . \" I understand that some believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of the moon first , as previously planned . But I just have to say here : We've been there before , \" Obama said . NASA Administrator Charles Bolden has also thrown cold water on the idea of a return mission to the moon .\nBut others believe there are benefits to going back to the moon . \" It's the closest body to us , making it the least challenging to explore of all the planets , moons and asteroids in our solar system , \" wrote Gene R. Grush , from NASA Johnson Space Center . \" It's an opportunity to establish a permanent presence off Earth - a moon base for scientists or a colony for all of humanity . \"\n\" There is a lot of good science on the moon that we've only scratched the surface on , \" said former astronaut Tom Jones . Richard Vondrak , from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center , agrees , saying , \" Astronauts can accomplish scientific exploration that is beyond the capability of robotic explorers . \"\nAnd then there's the private business . In the last few years , several private companies - including Elon Musk's SpaceX - have launched rockets of their own , ending the national control over space flight . NASA is even considering a partnership with SpaceX , and Musk has said that if demand to go to the moon exists , his company will help fill it .\nMeanwhile , Buzz Aldrin , the second person to walk on the moon , believes that there's a much better target for exploration : Mars . \" We've done the moon - we understand it better than anything else , \" Aldrin said . \" We've got to start thinking of long-term investments . \"", "id": "high19002.txt"}
