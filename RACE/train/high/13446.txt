An angry tourist took the photograph of the scrawl and posted it on social media Sina Weibo. It was quickly spread and there were more than 100,000 comments during two weeks. Later, a 15-year-old Chinese boy was searched out as the person who caved this message. Many netizens expressed their anger and disappointment for the uncivilized behavior. They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online.\nOver the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior. \"We want to apologize to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China.\" the boy's mother told the local newspaper.\nWith China's economy booming over the past decades, a growing number of the country's residents have become global tourists. Earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang addressed: \"Uncivilized behavior of some of tourists is giving this country a bad reputation abroad.\" The discussion about Chinese quality was carried out on many media.\nOn the bright side, Egypt government described the damage to the temple as superficial and could be restored and they would forgive the boy. While the act of Ding Jinhao symbolizes a national shame, meanwhile, many people concern about the child's development and wish he could return to anonymity once more. \"The boy has known his mistake and cried all night. He has to be moved around because reporters rushes to his house for interviews.\" said a reporter who talked with the parents.", "id": "high13446.txt"}
