Pat wanted to visit Latin America first, so she got a job as an English teacher in a school in Bolivia. Pat spoke a little Spanish, so she was able to communicate with her students even when they didn't know much English.\nOnce, A sentence she had read somewhere struck her mind: if you dream in a foreign language, you have really mastered it. Pat repeated this sentence to her students and hoped that some day she would dream in Spanish and they would dream in English.\nOne day, one of her worst students came up and explained in Spanish that he had not done his homework. He had gone to bed early and had slept badly.\n\"What does this have to do with your homework?\" Pat asked.\n\"I dreamed all night, Miss Jones. And my dream was in English.\"\n\"In English?\" Pat was very surprised, since he was such a bad student. She was even secretly jealous  . Her dream was still not in Spanish. But she encouraged her young student, \"Well, tell me about your dream.\"\n\"All the people in my dream spoke English. All the newspapers and magazines and all the TV programs were in English.\"\n\"But that's wonderful,\" said Pat. \"What did all the people say to you?\"\n\"I am sorry, Miss Jones. That's why I slept so badly. I didn't understand a word they said. It was a nightmare  \".", "id": "high5607.txt"}
