He would go to college at the far end of the city. He didn't want to live there, and he didn't want to take the bus either. So his father agreed to buy him a car.\nHis father spent all his summer teaching him how to drive, from the ABC to the XYZ. Thinking of the great feeling of driving a new car, Martin learned very quickly, and received his driver's license just before his eighteenth birthday.\nThe second day, all the family, and their dog, went to a car shop. Martin spent almost all the morning going from one car to another. Finally he saw a red Blue Bird. He had a test drive on the open ground, and called out, \"This is what I want, Dad!\" When everything was done, they were ready to leave.\nMartin climbed into the front seat. He said excitedly, \"It's my first day driving alone. Dad, Mom, and Poo! Enjoy it!\"\nHis dad immediately took the back seat, right behind the new driver. Martin wondered why his father chose that seat, for his father always enjoyed looking in front.\nSo he said, smiling, \"I'm sure you're back there to have a change after all those weeks of sitting in the front seat teaching me how to drive.\"\n\"No,\" Dad replied, \"Do you remember what you did to me all those years when I took you to and from school? I am sitting here to hit and kick the back of your seat all the way!\"", "id": "high7025.txt"}
