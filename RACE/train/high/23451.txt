They dream big dreams and then show great courage to do things that others say cannot be done.\nYour dreams form the foundation of success. Many people have long forgotten the dreams they used to have when they were kids. As they grow older, they are simply too caught up with their work activities that they fail to discover what they really want to pursue in life.\nTo get you back on track to pursue your dreams, follow these steps:\nLearn to dream again; We are born to dream. But we hear of teachers calling in school: \"Stop dreaming and pay attention in class!\" Parents , too, have shouted, \"Stop dreaming and go on with your homework!\" In the end, many do get \"realistic\" and give up their dreams in time.\nDream big dreams; Never set mental boundaries on what you are able to achieve. Dreams are free anyway so as long as you are dreaming, you might as well dream big. Many people cannot realize their dreams and achieve greater success because they limit their own beliefs.\nFlee from dream killers; Dream killers are destructive to your success. Your friends, colleagues and even loved ones can be one of your dream killers. There are people who will try to change, confuse or persuade you to build the life they want, not the life that you want.\nStop listening to the people who tell you why you will not achieve your dreams. You just need to believe you can do whatever it is you want to do.\nYou should stop giving reasons why you cannot achieve your dreams. Many so-called reasons are merely excuse.\nTake action immediately; Once you have big and clear dreams, take immediate action to work toward making them come true.\nWeeks later, the passion will grow cold and months later, that passion may be gone forever. Think about this; Five birds are resting on the fence and minutes later, three birds decide to fly off to search for food. How many birds are left on the fence?\nTwo? Wrong! There should still be five birds on the fence because deciding to fly off is not the same as the actual act of flying off.", "id": "high23451.txt"}
