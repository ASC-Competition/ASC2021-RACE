I'll leave that question to others.\nRegardless of how you feel about the event, one conclusion is obvious. Using the theme of \"A Day Without\" as a way to focus national attention on a particular subject is a great idea, and could serve as a method for increasing public consciousness about other issues that affect daily life in America. Here are my top three examples:\n\"A Day Without Speeding.\" How hard could this be? If all drivers would strictly obey every posted speed limit on highways, downtown, on neighborhood streets, and in parking lots for one 24-hour cycle, the benefits would be huge.\n\"A Day Without Losing Your Temper.\" A higher degree of difficulty here, and I know that from personal experience. When something goes wrong at home or on the job, there may be brief satisfaction in yelling or kicking the furniture, but bursting into anger usually has nothing to do with the approach to the heart of the matter.\n\"A Day Without Having All The Answers.\" I would like to get a break from hearing anyone speak the phrase, \"Here's what you're doing wrong.\" Right now the US is packed with citizens who believe they can point out the cause of every single problem in existence and then solve it in a moment. I believe they need to be quiet sometimes and use their ears instead of their voices.\nI wonder how would average Americans react to such a national pause? Would it be a day of reaction against anger, or joyful celebrations?", "id": "high5757.txt"}
