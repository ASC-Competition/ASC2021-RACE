So huge, in fact, that now I can't even remember what happened.\nIn the past nine years, I've seen her twice, and each time we've been polite but distant. And that troubles me because we were once inseparable. I'd like nothing more than to go back nine years, and continue our friendship. But how? How do you reconnect with friends you've lost throughout the years?\nLinking to your past\nThe desire to reconnect with lost friends isn't unusual. Why? Because friends link us to the past. \" _ ,\" says Sandy Sheehy.\nAlthough you can share information about your past with friends you've met recently, you don't have a shared history with them. So you wind up only telling them about your past, rather than sharing it with them.\nBut many people never try to reconnect. Women especially have trouble taking the first step. Shyness or fear that the other person doesn't want to reconnect often stops many women. And that shouldn't be. Your friends probably want to be in touch with you as much as you want to be in touch with them.\nSearching for friends\nFortunately, finding lost friends isn't as difficult as it once was, thanks to tools like the Internet. Our experts offer these suggestions for locating contact information:\nSearch Internet sites designed to locate people like classmates.com and switchboard.com.\nContact your high school or college alumni   office to request current address information.\nSurf online yellow pages. Check current phone records from your friend's hometown.\nNetwork with other friends who might have known your friend.\nGet in touch with any of her relatives, if you know where they live. If you know where she works, find the company's website and search the directory of personnel.", "id": "high733.txt"}
