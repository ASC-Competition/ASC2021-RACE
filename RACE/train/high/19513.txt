What was the purpose? It was just to overcome my fear of heights.\nSeven years ago, when I went to France, I couldn't go up the Eiffel Tower because I was afraid. It seemed so high. I wanted to overcome my fear, so I could dare to go skydiving . At first, I didn't think I could, but I finally made it.\n    I don't think that I could have jumped out of that plane without the encouragement of my wonderful friends and classmates--Yodel and Tatiana! It was a pity that we couldn't jump together. However, as we prepared to jump, there was something special among us-- a special bond.\nI made a reservation to go skydiving one week before the day of my jump. I felt nervous during the whole week, kind of blue; but mysteriously. When it was the moment to jump from the airplane, I didn't feel any fear... I just jumped! That was wonderful! Wonderful!\nThere was a whole new world and the beautiful sky. I had never seen such a beautiful world! First, I felt an awful acceleration  and then I felt like I was lying in the air...like a bird! I think it was an illusion, but it was wonderful!\nThe oncoming wind blew me strongly. It was amazing! After about 50 seconds free fall, the parachute opened. When I landed on the ground, I felt a lack of oxygen. It was difficult to breathe in during the freefall.\nI was so glad that I survived and was able to overcome my fear! Everything went well! If possible, I want to jump again. My first jump is an outstanding memory for me.", "id": "high19513.txt"}
