Mum pointed at a big chair by the door and I knew she wanted me to sit down. Then, Mum took off her hat and coat and gave them to me to hold. She walked quietly to the small room by the lift and took out a wet mop . She pushed the mop past the desk and as the nurse looked up, Mum nodded and said, \"Very dirty floors.\" \"Yes, I'm glad they've finally decided to clean them,\" the nurse answered. She looked at Mum strangely and said, \"But aren't you working late?\"\nMum just pushed harder, each swipe   of the mop taking her farther and farther down the hall. I watched until she was out of sight and the nurse had turned back to writing in the big book. After a long time Mum came back. Her eyes were shining.\nShe quickly put the mop back and took my hand. As we turned to go out of the door, Mum bowed politely to the nurse and said, \"Thank you.\"\nOutside, Mum told me \"Grandma is fine. No fever .\"\n\"You saw her, Mum?\"\n\"Of course.

You need a brush.\"", "id": "high8505.txt"}
