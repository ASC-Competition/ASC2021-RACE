But last week a report said that there are no more than 30 wild tigers left in south China.\nThis was the conclusion of a team of scientists from China's State Forestry Administration and the World Nature Fund.\nThe South China tiger, also known as the Chinese tiger, is native to southern China. In the 1950s, there were over 4,000 tigers found in mountain forests in the country. But due to the destruction of their natural habitat and uncontrolled hunting, it has been pushed on to the list of the world's top ten most endangered species. \nSixty-six of the big cats can be found in the cages of a dozen zoos around China. But they are nothing like their wild cousins. They have lost their natural skills such as hunting and killing. If they were set free they could not look after themselves.\n\"Breeding has damaged the quality of the species,\" said Pei Enle, deputy director of the Shanghai Zoo. \nTo reintroduce the species into the wild, the country started a programme to send five to ten young tigers to South Africa. Four of them have already arrived.\nProgress has been made as two elder tigers have recovered some of their instincts  and can hunt wild animals by themselves at the African base.\n\"South Africans are very experienced in reintroducing big animals to the wild. The country has very good natural conditions for the tigers to learn in,\" said Lu Jun, office director of the National Wildlife Research and Development Centre. \"We tried in Fujian Province, but it was not successful as there was not a complete eco-chain   and there was a lack of space.\"\nThe tigers should return to China in 2009 when the reservations in Fujian are ready.", "id": "high23030.txt"}
