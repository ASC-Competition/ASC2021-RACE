Thanks in large part to fast food, half of America's adults and one-quarter of its children are fat, double the rate of a generation ago.

Various kinds of mineral water are commonly available.\nEating styles and habits vary between people of different backgrounds, but Americans generally eat with the fork in the hand with which they write.
