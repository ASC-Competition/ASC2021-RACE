They published their findings online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS,<<>> ).\nThey carried out the first two experiments from the sidewalk near Berkeley. They noted that drivers of newer and more expensive cars were more likely to cut in on other cars and pedestrians at crosswalks. Nearly 45 percent of people driving expensive cars ignored a pedestrian compared with only 30 percent of people driving more modest cars.\nIn another experiment, a group of college students was asked if they would do unethical things in various everyday situations. Examples included taking printer paper from work and not telling a salesperson when he or she gave back more change. Students from higher-class families were more likely to act dishonestly.\nAccording to the scientists, rich people often think money can get them out of trouble. This makes them less afraid to take risks. It also means they care less about other people's feelings.\nFinally,it simply makes them greedier.\"Higher wealth status seems to make you want even more,and that increased want leads you to bend the rules or break the rules to serve your self-interest,\" said Paul Piff, leading scientist of the study.\nPiff pointed out that the findings don't mean that all rich people are untrustworthy or that all poor people are honest. He said the experiments were to show how people living in different social situations express their instincts and values in different ways.", "id": "high8188.txt"}
