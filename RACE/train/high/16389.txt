Today about 15 percent of adults, or 200 million Chinese, are reportedly overweight.Of these, 90 million--about 7 percent--are obese .\nExperts say the obesity epidemic  is spreading to children, though more slowly than in adults. The obesity, they say, will do harm to the health of China' s citizens and economy.\"We're seeing a very large number of teenagers who are quite heavy and aren't moving much,\" said Barry Popkin, a nutrition  professor. Popkin carries out an ongoing healthandnutrition survey of 16,000 households in China. He says more kids today are overeating and putting on weight \"quite quickly.\" In just ten years China's childhood obesity rate has doubled,with the greatest gains coming in urban areas.\"In big cities it's a big problem.\"\nSome experts blame the extra fat on a range of factors, many of them tied to China' s rapidly changing economy and culture. The diets of Chinese adults and children are far higher in meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, fats and sugars than ever before. In addition,kids--especially city dwellers--are more\ntoday and spend more time indoors in front of homework, television,computer games, and the Internet.\nShuwen Ng,a health economist, says that kids in China now have pocket money, and they spend a portion of it on junk food. Ng adds that advertising and peer groups influence kids' food choices. Certain foods, such as new candies or fast food, have attractive features.\nChina' s childhood obesity rate stillfall behind that of the United States, where some 15 percent of kids are said to be obese.
