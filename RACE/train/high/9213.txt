May I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman smiled, \"I don't know what this is about,son,\" she answered,\"but the young lady in the green suit begged me to wear this rose on my coat.And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner,I should tell you that she is waiting for you in the restaurant across the street.She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to admire Miss  Maynell's wisdom.
