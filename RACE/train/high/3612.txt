She already had more clothes than she knew what to do with them, so he couldn't get any kind of apparel. She never ate sweets, so candy was out of the question. What then? He had a very special reason for wanting to impress her with just the right gift,for tomorrow he was going to make an offer of marriage to her. He finally decided on perfume . All girls liked perfume. That raised another problem, however. What kind did she prefer? He couldn't ask her because that would ruin the surprise.\nAt last the young man hit upon a brilliant idea. That afternoon, pretending to take his girlfriend's fox terrier ,Fritz, for a walk, the young man and the dog went directly to the perfume counter of the town's biggest department store. Good! There was a large array of perfume. He beckoned a clerk, asking her to open a large number of bottles and wave the stoppers  under the dog's nose.

One day, after they were married, he would admit that his intuition had really been the little dog named Fritz.", "id": "high3612.txt"}
