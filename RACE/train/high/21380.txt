Is chat you?\" The woman speaking to me at he baseball game looked somewhat familiar,\n     \"Marci? \"\n     \"It IS you ! \" she exclaimed, smiling broadly. \"God, it's good to see you again !\"\n      It was good to see Marci, too. Very often during the past few decades, I've wondered about her, I almost tried to reach her a few years ago after talking to a shared friend, who had indicated  that the 1990s had been pretty rough for Marci. So, running into her at the baseball game was, at the very least, just happening by chance.\n         We spent a few minutes talking about the business of our lives: kids and grandkids, husbands and houses, education and recreation. It's always a little upsetting to see how few words are required to summarize 32 years of living. We played a little \"have you seen...?\" and \"did you know,..?\" And we recalled the good old,  bad old days we used to spend together.\n         Then Marci grew quiet for a moment, looking out over the crowd walking about the marketing area at the stadium.\n          \"You know,  Joe.\" she said, \"I've always wanted to tell you...how...you know...how sorry I am for the way I treated you.\"\n      Hearing that, I felt I was suffering extreme embarrassment. One does not like to remember when one has been rid of by others roughly and suddenly.\n      \"It's OK.\" I said. \"No big deal.\" At least, I thought to myself, not now.\n      \"But I was so stupid: she continued.\n      Yes, you were. I thought. \"We were both pretty young:' I said.\n      \"I know,\" she said. \"But that's no excuse for...\" She hesitated. then continued. \"It's just always bothered me,  remembering how mean I was to you.And I've wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. So...I'm sorry.\"\n         The smile on her face was warm and sincere, and there was something in her eyes, it looked\na lot like relief--  _ since she had played Wif'fle ball with my heart.\n         \"OK:'I said. \"Apology accepted!\n    Overcome by the sweetness of the moment. I reached an arm around her and gave her a quick hug Just then, the crowd erupted with a huge cheer, and Marci and I both returned our attention to the game  By the time I looked over to where she had been, she was gone. But the warm, wonderful feeling of our brief exchange was still there, and continues to this day whenever I think about it .\n      We all carry bitter, discomforting memories of deeds done or undone, and words said or unsaid. And we all bear wounds --some slight, some not so slight--that have been inflicted  upon us by others.The healing balm of forgiveness can calm a troubled conscience and bring  peace to an injured soul, even years after the fact.\n     Of course,it isn't enough to just say \"I'm sorry,\" and \"You're forgiven.\" While there is  indeed great power in those simple words, it is not available to those who are insincere, or who are only looking for a way to control or exploit.But when those words are truly felt and sincerely expressed , they can open the door to miracles( )of the heart and soul - miracles of forgiveness, even at a baseball game.", "id": "high21380.txt"}
