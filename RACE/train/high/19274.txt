That sounds like a line straight out of a fantasy novel, but it's one hundred percent real life! It's an unusual  sight--a crowd of butterflies flying around the eyes of yellow-spotted river turtles, trying to get a little tear.s. The poor turtles try to avoid them, hut the butterflies insist drinking  their tears until they've had their fill.\nThe butterflies are likely attracted to the turtles' tears because the liquid drops contain  salt, specifically sodium, an important mineral that is rare in the western Amazon rainforest, said Phil Torres, a scientist who does much of his research at the Tambopata Research Center in Peru and is associated with Rice Univtrsity. Turtles get plenty of sodium  through their largely carnivorous  diet.  Meat contains significant levels of the salt, Torres told LiveScience. But herbivores  butterflies sometimes .struggle to get this extra mineral source, he added.\nTorres explained the western Amazon rainforest is lower in sodium than many places on earth, because it t is over l,000 miles away from the Atlantic Ocean---a main source of salt. The region is also cut off from the mineral dirt blown towards the west from the Andes Mountains. Most of these windblown minerals are removed from the air by the rain before they have a chance to reach the western Amazon.\nIn fact, the butterflies have other sources to get sodium besides turtles' tears, which include animal urine , muddy river banks, sweaty clothes and so on.\nPeople can't help wondering if the process is painful for turtles. Torres said it's not completely clear, but the teary effort probably has little effect on the turtles, other than perhaps making them more vulnerable to their enemies like big cats, since the butterflies can block out their vision.", "id": "high19274.txt"}
