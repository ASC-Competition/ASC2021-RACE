President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama held the event by inviting thousands of kids to color and look for eggs. The theme  of the day was \"Hop Into Healthy, Swing Into Shape.\" It was part of the First Lady's \"Let's Move!\" program to reduce obesity rates   among American kids. Mrs. Obama spoke to young reporters about her goal  to get children to eat right and keep moving.\n\"We are working to make sure that kids born today grow up healthy, learn how to have balanced meals, and get more physical activity into their lives,\" she said.\nMrs. Obama said she wants children across the nation to understand that \"exercise isn't just hard work, it's play. If you're running around with your dog, you're getting exercise. If you walk up the stairs, that's exercise, But if you're sitting in front of the TV or on a computer game, you're not exercising.\"\nThe First Lady said that for kids who have balanced meals most of the time, having a special snack, like chocolate, will not hurt.\" And if you are active, you can splurge   a little more,\" she said. Mrs. Obama's favorite \"splurge food\" is French fries. But she balances her splurging by exercising almost every day. She loves to play tennis and she practices yoga.\n\"A lot of kids look up to  athletes, and I think it's important for athletes to share their good habits,\" Mrs. Obama said. \"Kids aren't just going to wake up and be LeBron James. He's practicing and eating right and working out and training. Our athletes can be really good messengers to kids who look up to them--they can say to kids, 'If you really want to be like me, then you really do need to eat your vegetables.'\"", "id": "high8699.txt"}
