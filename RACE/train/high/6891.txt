Here are the top four travel destinations in Africa:\nTanzania----Serengeti National Park\nDuring the annual migration , when the wildebeests  and zebras pack up and leave their living areas to find fresher ones, the Serengeti is an astonishing place to be. It's a very good travel spot in Africa at other times of the year too, but the migration has been ranked by many as one of the wonders of the natural world.\nKenya----Masai Mara National Park\nIf you want to see the big cats, this wildlife park is the best of the best. Lion, leopard and cheetah abound and they are relatively easy to spot because of the grassland vegetation which means you get good views for miles around. Another big plus is the fact that going off road is allowed and it is a big advantage because the animals will rarely oblige you and stay next to the major roads.\nSouth Africa-Kruger National Park\nFor the variety of species no other places in Africa can come close to the Kruger Park. And because it is so large it has a number of different ecosystems that you can pass through in your search for animals and birds. It is one of the best managed parks in Africa and the accommodation is well-equipped, too.\nZambia-South Luangwa National Park\nSouth Luangwa is a diamond in the rough, just waiting for enough exposure to bring it to its rightful place in the crown of prime Africa trips. It has been regarded as one of the best places in Africa to see the special leopard and it is the birthplace of the walking travel.", "id": "high6891.txt"}
