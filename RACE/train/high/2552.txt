Lauren Smith, 24, is close to completing her study on shark's ability to sense pressure. If her studies prove the theory, scientists may be able to monitor the behavior of sharks to predict bad weather.\nMiss Smith had previously studied the behavior of lemon sharks in the Bahamas.\nShe then used their close relatives, lesser spotted dogfish, for further research at Aberdeen University.\nHer work---thought to be the first of its kind to test the pressure theory ---- resulted from the observation that juvenile blacktip sharks off Florida moved into deeper water ahead of a violent storm in 2001.\nMiss Smith said: \"I've always been crazy about traveling and diving and this led me to an interest in sharks.\"\n\"I was delighted to have been able to research in the area for my degree. I know there's so much more we need to understand ---- but it certainly opens the way to more research.\"\nIt has been discovered that a shark senses pressure using hair cells in its balance system.\nAt the Bimini Shark Lab in the Bahamas, Miss Smith fixed hi-tech sensors to sharks to record pressure and temperature, while also tracking them using GPS (Global Positioning System) technology.\nIn Aberdeen, she was able to study the effects of tidal   and temperature changes on dogfish----none of which were harmed. She also used a special lab which can mimic   oceanic pressure changes caused by weather fronts.\nShe is due to complete her study and graduate later this year. She says she will be looking for a job which will give her the chance to enrich her experience of shark research.", "id": "high2552.txt"}
