A click on the Great Wall will bring the earth nearer, and slowly a white line is seen across the Chinese land in the north. A closer view shows that this is the Great Wall. \nNetizens will be able to appreciate the Great Wall with the eye of a tourist and \"walk\" from Shanhai Pass in the east of the Great Wall to Jiayu Pass in the west in just a couple of days. They can also take a look at the mineral resources and economic status of regions along the Great Wall. CASS and the Great Wall Society are trying their best to make this dream come true through working together closely. \nAccording to Zhang, to achieve the above effects, scientists will rely on airborne   remote sensing, national geographical information system and global positioning system to collect detailed data of the Great Wall, analyze and process the data, apply them to satellite images for 3D translation, and thereafter create a 3D digital image of the Great Wall for the entire world to appreciate the really great Great Wall of China via the Internet.", "id": "high22835.txt"}
