The fearless girl is only 10, but already has scaled great heights in the sport of rock climbing.\nLast week, Kane won a bronze in the 11andyounger sport class at the USA Climbing Youth National Championships in Atlanta. She was the only competitor of the 31 there with no climbing coach or topflight facilities in which to train. Climbing will become an exhibition at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Brazil. The hope of enthusiasts is that the sport will gain full status in 2020.\"I'm already training for that,\" said Kane. \"Climbing is my passion, my love, and I want to make something of it.\"\nHer dad took her to climb rocks on her fourth birthday for the first time and today he can't keep up with her, \"It's the freedom to let loose,\" she said. \"When I'm up there, I'm so focused and don't hear anything. I always feel comforted knowing people are supporting me.\"\nThe bronze in Atlanta qualified Kane for the USA team and November's International Championships in Ecuador. That's a trip she might have to miss because it's too expensive.\nKane held a backyard music concert---she played the guitar and the piano and wrote inspirational songs---and raised $600 for her $1,500 trip to Atlanta. She's also been sponsored by a shoe company, but must rely heavily on donations from family and friends for travel expenses.\nHer mom Heather Kane said the family has chosen \"to do whatever we need to help her achieve her goals\". One of Grace's biggest challenges is finding balance in her life. There's school, her music and church to fit around climbing.\n\"Climbing is going to mean sacrificing things other kids might pursue,\" Grace said. \"But it doesn't bother me. It's like playing the piano; you can't take a break or you'll lose your touch.\"", "id": "high15423.txt"}
