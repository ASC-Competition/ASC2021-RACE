Healthy people who tested the device quickly learned to play computer games and write sentences by sniffing. Encouraged by the results, the researchers decided to test their device on people who are paralyzed   but whose intelligence remains normal. Ten paralyzed who tested the device quickly learned to use their noses to write words, open a webpage, copy words and put them into a search engine.\nWith their success in helping severely disabled people to communicate * the researchers decided to make use of the new technology to design an electric wheelchair to be driven by sniffs.\nTen healthy people easily mastered sniff--driving a wheelchair through a maze  , and a 30-year-old man who had been paralyzed from the neck down for six years was as good a sniff-driver as the healthy participants at his second attempt. In other words, a paralyzed person could use the sniff controller to drive an electric wheelchair.\nAt the moment, sniff-controlled technology is still in the stage of development, and the Weizmann Institute has already applied for a patent on the device. \"Ill be very happy if it can help us to make money, but the real problem is that I hope someone will develop it, because this would help a lot of people,\" said Sobel, one of the lead researchers of the study.", "id": "high9690.txt"}
