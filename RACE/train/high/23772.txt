My father and I went to the market to buy a few oranges. When we arrived, the market was crowded with people. We looked around and stopped at the sight of a small booth . It was just a big piece of cloth on the ground with a few fresh-looking oranges. A young girl was sitting on the ground, reading next to the booth. \n   My father cleared his throat and asked,'How much are the oranges?'\n   The girl jumped up and asked,'Oh....what?'\n   'How much are the oranges?' my father repeated patiently.\n   'Oh......two for one yuan ,'the girl answered politely. 'They are not fully grown......a bit sour ,' she added ,when my father was examining the oranges.\n   After a while he said, 'I don 't mind if they are sour......I'll buy thirty of them.' I looked at him, baffled . Then the girl put the oranges in a bag and gave it to him. My father paid for the oranges and we left. \n   'Why did you buy so many oranges?' I asked my father,\n   'Well, she was so truthful and even told me that her oranges are sour; besides, she really enjoys studying. And look at her book-it's so old; maybe she can use the money she earned to buy a book!' \n    I nodded my head. Just then, I felt somebody pulling my arm; I turned and recognized it was the girl from whom we bought the oranges.' Here's......here's ......your change  ......' she panted , and put the money in my hand. Before we could say something ,she had already turned a corner and was out of sight. The girl and her oranges will be in my memory forever.", "id": "high23772.txt"}
