Some speak differently while others act differently.\nMy mother is in a wheelchair. I would like to say something about this special woman I call \"Mommy\".\nMy mom does what a mom needs to do every day. She picks me up from school,drives me to meetings,cooks dinner,and helps me with my homework. This is just part of what makes her great,though.\nShe is my best friend and can immediately notice when I am unhappy. She helps me solve problems that my friends do not understand. Mommy makes me laugh when times are tough. I look forward to coming home because I know there is someone there who cares about what I have done.\nMommy has always tried to be like a \"normal\" mom. But I think my mother is a wonderful woman and she doesn't need to change. She teaches me life lessons that no teacher or friend can. She shows me how to accept everyone for what is inside,rather than what is on the outside.\nYou may have realized that all the qualities   I admire have nothing to do with what she looks like. Everyone could be the way she is,but most are not.\nI want everyone to look beyond the surface and see what is inside others. You may fail to notice someone who is very special like my mom because you cannot accept their outside features.", "id": "high1923.txt"}
