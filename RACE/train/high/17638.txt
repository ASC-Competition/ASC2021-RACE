Believe it or not,this scene takes place all summer     long,at Bracken Cave in Texas,where 20 million bats come out to feed on insects every     night.\"It is magical,\"says Jim Kennedy of Bat Conservation International in Texas.\"It is     one of the most impressive animal movements on the planet.\"\n    Every March or April,Mexican free-tailed bats migrate up to 1,600 kilometers from     their winter home in Mexico to their American home in Texas,where they raise their     young. Soon after they arrive,each mother gives birth to one baby.As many as 500,baby     bats crowd into 30 cubic centimeters of space.and all those bodies create nice warm tem-    peratures to keep them cozy and comfortable.\n    If you have ever lost sight of your parents in a crowded playground,you may be won-    dering how mother bats recorgnize their children.They use their sense of smell to tell which     baby is theirs when it is time for the babies to have milk.    \n    When twenty million bats fly out of one cave opening,they make a column so thick     that they show up on the radar at the nearby airport.It can take three hours for all of them     to get out from the cave.\"You can feel the breeze from their wings,and see the plats wa-    ving,\"says Kennedy.\"The movement of all those wings makes a very relaxing soft sound.I've always thought it would make a great relaxation music to help you go to sleep. So much     for bats being scary!\"", "id": "high17638.txt"}
