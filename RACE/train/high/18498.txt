The President must secure his cooperation, and quickly.\nWhat to do!\nSomeone said to the President, \"A fellow by the name of Rowan will find Garcia for you, if anybody can.\"\nRowan was sent for and given a letter to be delivered to Garcia. How he took the letter, in four days landed by night off the coast of Cuba from an open boat, disappeared into the jungle, in three weeks came out on the other side of the Island, and had delivered his letter to Garcia, are things I have no special desire now to tell in detail.\nThe point I wish to make is this: Rowan was given a letter to be delivered to Garcia; Rowan took the letter and did not ask, \"Where is he?\" He was loyal to a trust. He acted quickly and concentrated the energies: do the thing -- \"Carry a message to Garcia!\"\nMy heart goes out to the man who, when given a letter for Garcia, quietly takes it, without asking any idiotic   questions, but delivers it. This man is wanted in every city, town and village -- in every office, shop, store and factory. The world cries out for such: he is needed, and needed badly -- the man who can carry a message to Garcia.", "id": "high18498.txt"}
