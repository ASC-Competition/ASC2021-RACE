We all do silly things at times -- no one is immune -- but treating wild animals as lovely pets has to fall into a special category. Teddy bears and Disney movies aren't actually representative of real bears.\nComments (3) View Comments\n3 Comments\n _ \n1.

Stories that begin with a drunk person saying \"Hey, I got an idea, watch this!\" rarely end well.\n3. Tristan Kloss - Mar 11, 2010 11:41 AM\nAlcohol certainly isn't involved when people decide to keep \"pets\" like chimpanzees, baby tigers, etc. Stupidity, definitely. Dogs are pets because of thousands of years of domestication. Even farm animals, which have been kept by humans for thousands of years as well, aren't let in the house. So why keep animals that treat human contact with, at best, indifference(, ) and, at worst, violence?", "id": "high8874.txt"}
