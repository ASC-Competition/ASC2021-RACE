Children like to guess what they are going to have and parents get the chance to introduce new food to children and to find out which food they like and which ones they don't.\nTeens may turn up their noses at your plan of a family meal. It is not surprising because they're trying to establish independence. Yet studies find that teens still want their parents' advice, so use the mealtime as a chance to reconnect.\nStocking up   on healthy food\nKids, especially younger ones, will eat mostly what they can get at home. That's why it's important to control the supply lines -- the food which you serve for meals and have on hand for snacks. You should have enough fruits, vegetables, lean meat and other good sources of protein, such as eggs and nuts, and healthy snacks, such as yogurt, peanut butter and whole-grain biscuits.\nBeing a good example\nThe best way for you to encourage healthy eating is to eat well yourself. Kids will follow the lead of the adults they see every day. By eating fruits and vegetables and avoiding fast food and sugary drinks, you'll be sending the right message.\nNo conflicts over food\nParents might find themselves shouting at children to get them to have healthy food in front of them. This in fact can make children dislike what they are aske d to eat.\nGet kids included\nMost kids will enjoy making the decision about what to make for dinner. Talk to them about making choices and planning a balanced meal. It can help them make good decisions on their own about the  food they want to eat.", "id": "high4580.txt"}
