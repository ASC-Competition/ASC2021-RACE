Scientists studied 12,000 employees aged\nbetween 18 and 65.They found that those who traveled to work by car or public transport\nreported higher levels of stress and tiredness compared to active commuters who traveled by foot\nor bicycle. The negative health of public transport users increased with journey time.\n      It is now expected that the study, from Lund University in Sweden, will encourage further\n  investigation into the health effects of commuting and the best forms of transportation.\n      Researcher Erik Hansson said:\"Generally car and public transport users suffered more\n  everyday stress, poorer sleep quality, exhaustion and felt that they struggled with their health\n  compared to the active commuters.\"\n      According to the Office for National Statistics, the average Briton commutes 54 minutes\n  every day.\n      But now the scientists claim that the advantages of daily travel, such as higher pay or\n  housing conditions, need to be weighed against the negative health effects. Income, family\nbackground and environmental factors are other things that need to be considered.\n    It may also have a cost effect on industry. According to a Absence and Workplace Health\n  Survey, the U.K. economy lost 190 million working days to absence last year, with each\nemployee taking an average of 6.5 days off sick, costing employers US$27 billion.\n    Hansson added that findings would help to reconsider the balance between economic needs,\nhealth, and the costs of working days lost. However, researchers stress that the findings,\npublished in the journal BMC Public Health, do not prove that commuting causes ill health and\n  further research is needed.", "id": "high21122.txt"}
