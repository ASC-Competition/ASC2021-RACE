You don't need statistics to understand the Dane's happy lot . Walk around any Danish town and you'll experience some of the most harmonious civic spaces anywhere . Their intimate scales and perfect transport systems combine the rich history and bold modern lines of the built environment to delight the eye , and the locals' manners and sense of humor is refreshing .\nDenmark's capital Copenhagen is a remarkable city with well-preserved medieval streets , renowned art galleries , Michelin-starred restaurants and a healthy business center . Finding something to do is never a problem and if all else fails , just admiring the streets with a hotdog in hand is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours .\nBeyond the capital and the bigger cities , Denmark offers a mix of lively towns such as Ribe and Odense plus rural countryside , medieval churches , Renaissance castles and tidy 18th-century villages .\nThe coastline of Denmark with its sand dunes and greenery is a sight that always attracts visitors . So , no matter what time of year you're in Denmark , you shouldn't miss out on a trip to the nearest beach .\nIt's hard , in short , to find fault with the place .

When viewed in this way , this first-rate destination seems like good value , and you get the fairy tales thrown in for free : the Danish royal family is genuinely loved and respected by the vast majority of its citizens , not least handsome Prince Frederik , his beautiful Australian-born princess-bride , Mary , and their young family .", "id": "high7142.txt"}
