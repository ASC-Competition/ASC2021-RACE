Gallaudet is said to be the world's only liberal arts university where everything is designed for deaf or hard-of-hearing students.About 2,000 students attend Gallaudet.The cost for international students is about 33,000 dollars a year.\nFinancial aid is available in the form of scholarships,but only after the first year of studies. Most scholarship aid goes to students in financial need who do well in their first year.One scholarship for international students is for deaf students from developing countries.Another is just for students from China.The university also offers an English Language Institute.But Gallaudet says this program does not guarantee  acceptance to the university.\nIn the past year,students at Gallaudet protested against the administration's choice of a new president for the university.The protests led to the choice of a different president who is more popular with the students,Robert Davila.He is a former officer of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.This technical college is in Rochester, New York.  It is one of the eight colleges in the Rochester Institute of Technology.\nMore than one thousand students attend the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. About one hundred of them are international students.They come from Africa, Asia,Europe and South America.\nThe cost is about 28,000 dollars a year for an international Technical Institute student.Foreign graduate students pay about 20,000 dollars.  Both undergraduate and graduate student can receive limited financial aid. They can also take part in the student employment program.This program makes it possible for students to work at the school.", "id": "high15492.txt"}
