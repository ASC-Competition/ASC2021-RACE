He was out of the shipping lanes and floating in a life raft, alone. His supplies were few. His chances were small. Yet when three fishermen found him seventy-six days later, he was alive.\nHis account of how he survived is fascinating. But the thing that caught my eye was how he managed to keep himself going when all hope seemed lost. Giving up would have seemed the only wise option.\nWhen people survive these kinds of circumstances, they do something with their minds that gives them the courage to keep going. Many people in similarly desperate circumstances give in or go mad.\n\"I tell myself I can handle it,\" wrote Callahan. \"Compared to what others have been through, I'm fortunate. I tell myself these things over and over, building up fortitude....\"\nIt struck me as something important. And I've told myself the same thing when my own goals seemed far off or when my problems seemed too overwhelming. And every time I've said it, I have always come back to my senses.\nThe truth is, our circumstances are only bad compared to something better. But others have been through much worse. So here, coming to us from the extreme edge of survival, are words that can give us strength. Whatever you're going through, tell yourself you can handle it. Tell this to yourself over and over, and it will help you get through the rough spots.", "id": "high19696.txt"}
