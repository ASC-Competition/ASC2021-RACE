All theme parks in Britain have cafes, restaurants, picnic areas and gift shops, so you'll still have plenty to see and do when you and the kids have been on enough rides. There are usually smaller \"funfair\" rides and games as well, so younger children won't get bored. Several theme parks also have other attractions next to them, e.g. water parks often open all year round, unlike the theme parks.\nWherever you are in Britain, there's likely to be a theme park within one or two hours' drive, bus ride or train journey. Several theme parks even have accommodation  so you can stay for a day or two if you want to make a trip into a short holiday.\nPrices for UK theme parks vary considerably; some have an entrance price which allows you to go on all the rides, while in others you have to pay for every ride individually. It can also make a difference whether you go during peak time or not. For example, tickets always cost more during school holidays and weekends than they do during the weekdays.\nTheme parks always get very busy during the summer months, so if you don't like crowds, it's usually a good idea to go earlier or later in the year!\nIf you're thinking of visiting a UK theme park, it's worth having a look for special offers on tickets. Products such as chocolate bars and cereals sometimes have \"buy one get one free\" offers on theme park tickets, so keep a look out in shops and supermarkets.", "id": "high8532.txt"}
