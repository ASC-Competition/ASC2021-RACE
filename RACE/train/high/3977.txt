This week, figures from UCAS(the Universities and College Admissions service)show a 15-percent downturn in applications  from this time last year. With fees having reached PS9,000 a year, some students are beginning to consider other ways of getting higher education--including distance learning, which allows them to get a degree while still living, and earning money, at home.\nThat is important, because fees are only part of the picture. The National Union of Students says that UK students pay an average of PS4,900 a year for basics such as rent, food, books, equipment, field trips and the like. If those costs can be reduced, the burden of fees will be lessened. Therefore, many people are thinking not only about what and where to study, but how--that is, whether they have to be on campus to get a degree.\nDistance learning is best suited to certain subjects and to ultra-motivated student, according to Carrie-Anne Rice of Resource Development International(RDI).\"The advantage is that the fee system is more flexible , and you can have full-time work while studying, Rice says.\"\"You graduate three years ahead of possible competitors -- with the same degree, but with three years of work experience and without the debt.\"\n\"I left school and went straight into work. But at the age of 23, I changed career and soon realized I needed a degree to advance. Because of lack of money ad time, full-time university wasn't a good choice, but I discovered that distance learning was financially flexible and enabled me to work and gain skills from my workplace without affecting the quality of my life,\" Andy Cain, a distance learning student says.\nAlthough distance learning has many advantages, a campus-based university experience remains the dream of most school-leavers. There is no question that \"being there\" is not only fun, but rich in shared experience, pooled knowledge, and--perhaps most importantly--friendships that will go on long after the degrees have been awarded.", "id": "high3977.txt"}
