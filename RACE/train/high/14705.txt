A total of 9 bullets was found, and the various tests and analysis have confirmed that they were indeed fired at the animal in the 19th Century.\nNine of the wounds on the animal are believed to have been caused by Enfield Pattern 1853 muskets. These old injuries were concentrated around the animals tail and hind legs, suggesting that the alligator could have possibly been used as a target for shooting practice by Confederate troops.\nThe huge animal also bore five other bullet wounds from three different calibers  of hunting guns, as well as many dents and scars, which shows that it survived many firearm injuries in the past. It did not however, survive the six 50-caliber bullets fired at him by the group of amateur hunters from Jackson, who were finally able to take it down.\nThe bullets were confirmed as true musket from between 1850 and 1870. This incredible animal brings a whole new view on this large animal native to the southeastern United States. American alligators have been known for years to live well over 50 years and were thought capable of possibly living as long as 70 or 80 years, but this one was estimated to have been 185 years old at the time of its death.\nOthers like turtles, have been known, to have lifespans of over 150 years, but it is the first of crocodile of such an old age ever found. It is also one of the biggest alligators ever killed in the United States. The heaviest ever recorded, weighing in at an unbelievable 1,011.5 lbs, was pulled out of a river in Alabama in August of this yea.", "id": "high14705.txt"}
