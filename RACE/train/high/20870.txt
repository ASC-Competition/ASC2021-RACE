There are very few places in the world where one cannot find a television set. Some sporting events, such as the Olympic Games or the football World Cup, can attract audiences of many millions. But is television a good or bad influence on young people in the modern world? \nThomas Murray, president of the British Parents Against Television Society, believes that it has not improved young people's lives. \"Television damages family life,\" he argues. \"At mealtime, families no longer talk to each other. In the evenings, youngsters do not spend good quality time with family members. Instead, they watch television.\" Murray says that this lack of communication leads to social problems.\nMurray also believes that the content of television programmes provides young people with poor role models. \"There is so much violence  on TV--guns, kung fu fighting, and so on. Young people think that all problems should be solved by aggression.\"\nIt is not just young people's mental health that worries Murray. \"Teenagers don't get enough exercise because they spend so many hours watching television. They also develop back problems from sitting down for so long, and  _ from the effort of watching.\"\nMurray would like to see changes to television habits. \"Programmes should be educational. Their contents should be nonviolent and healthy. There should be no programmes after ten o'clock in the evening. Parents should teach their children to enjoy their spare time by playing sports or games. And certainly, the television should be switched off during mealtime.\nSusan Taylor is a television producer. She believes that television is a good influence on young people. \"Television brings the outside world to youngsters. It even brought us pictures from the moon! And look what happens after the Olympic Games or the World Cup matches have been shown on TV. People start to take more exercise. Also, there are a lot of programmes about healthy eating and keeping fit.\"\nHowever, Taylor agrees with Murray's point of view concerning parents. \"Of course parents have a role to play in educating their kids. They should turn the TV off during mealtime and they should talk with their children as often as possible.\"", "id": "high20870.txt"}
