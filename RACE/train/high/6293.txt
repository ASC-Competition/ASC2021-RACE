A study of more than 1,000 pupils in the city of Lawrence suggests it does.\nYoungsters who took part in the breakfast program improved their scores in the tests much more than those who didn't. Among those who attended the program, fewer were found late for school than those who didn't. And much fewer were found absent from their classes.\n\"Starting the day with a meal appears to be quite helpful,\" says Amy Sampson, a research professor, who carried out the experiment on the students for a year.\nStudents who miss breakfast may be losing out on important nourishment in fruit, milk, bread and so on. If you are in a hurry in the morning, get you some pieces of bread with some fruit or yogurt. In that case, you won't have to go to the selling machines for some chips or candy bars.", "id": "high6293.txt"}
