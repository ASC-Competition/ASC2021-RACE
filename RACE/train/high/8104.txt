A new iPhone application that takes a picture of the meal with the phone and gives a calorie read-out almost at once, may help. The MealSnap was developed by DailyBurn, a fitness social network that has created several other fitness and diet-related iPhone applications.\nWithin minutes of taking a picture of a meal and matching it to the given information of some 500, 000 kinds of food, the application sends users a warning with a range of calories for the meal that was photographed.\nTo start with, we sent it something simple--a Braeburn apple. A couple of minutes later the application replied that it was between 64 and 96 calories.\nAndy Smith, chief director at DailyBurn, said: \"The database  can also quickly help recognize the food, how many calories there are, proteins, fat, carbs, vitamins, whatever you may want to know.\"\nMr Smith added that it will take some time to complete calorie counting but the application makes it easier to record the calories in food. That is why it is so popular among those who are trying hard to lose weight.\n\"The pure act of recording something can cause a psychological  change that can help people on their health and fitness plan. Just the simple fact of recording it makes me more understand what I'm eating,\" he said.\nIn addition, MealSnap can serve as a food diary, allowing users to keep a readable record of the meals they have eaten. Mr Smith said:\"It's like a food journal, but easier. All you do is take the picture.\" MealSnap is available on the iTunes store for PS1.79, or $2,99 in the US.", "id": "high8104.txt"}
