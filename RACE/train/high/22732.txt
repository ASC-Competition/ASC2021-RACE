John was so busy with his work that he couldn't go back home. When he passed by a flower shop in the evening, an idea came to his mind. \"I'll send Mum some roses  . \"\n      While John was picking his flowers, a young man went inside. \"How many roses can I get for only five dollars, Madam?\" he asked. The assistant was trying to tell him roses were as expensive as forty dollars a dozen  . Maybe he would be happy with carnations .\n     \"No, I have to have red roses. \" He said, \"My mum was badly ill last year and I didn't get to spend much time with her. Now I want to get something special, it has to be roses as rose is her favourite. \"\n      After hearing it, John said he would pay the rest of the money for the young man. Moved by both of them, the assistant said, \"Well, lovely young men, thirty dollars a dozen, only for you. \"Taking the roses, the young man almost jumped into the air and ran out of the shop. It was well worth twenty-five dollars John paid to see the exciting moment. Then John paid for his dozen of roses and told the assistant to send them to his mother.\n      As he walked out, he felt nice. Suddenly he saw the young man crossing the street and going into a park. But soon he realized it was not a park but a cemetery  . Crying, the young man carefully laid the roses,\" Mum, oh, Mum, why didn't I tell you how much I loved you ? God, please help me find my mum and tell her I love her. \"\n     Seeing this, John turned and quickly walked to the shop. He would take the flowers home himself.", "id": "high22732.txt"}
