It also has tracking capabilities to help locate its owner. \"The beauty about CHIP is that it has its own thing going on,\" said Sufer, CTO at WowWee. \"It has its own life and own kind of intelligence. Even if you're not around, it's always doing something.\"\nCHIP uses wheels to get around and is loaded with sensors  that give it a 360-degree view to find its ball. The pup is Bluetooth enabled, which connects to a wristband worn by its owner. The wristband, similar to a watch, displays icons for different commands such as a thumb-up, which allows you to give your pup a digital belly rub. With its owner wearing a smart wristband, it can even follow him around the room.\n\"We worked on CHIP for about five to six months,\" Davin Sufer, told dailymail.com, \"We typically come up with a concept, model and product and get it on shelves within a year.\" The company plans to start shipping units by next fall, which will allow them to load up the robotic dog with sensors and add many more animated responses per-owner interactivity.\nThe high-tech toy company made its debut in 2004 by releasing the 1.5 foot RoboSapien, which sold millions of units. MiP, which hit shelves last year, is a seven inch tall robot covered in white with black accents. Users can direct it, change its emotions and make it dance to any song on your iPad. It's loud, fast and active.\nAbout 15 years ago, a company called ToyQuest developed the first ever electronic robotic dog---Tekno, the Robotic Puppy. The company sold over seven million units in the first season and 40 million more during its original four years of production. Tekno was built with over 160 emotions and instructions, but most importantly offered consumers a quick look into the future.", "id": "high13308.txt"}
