With longer periods of time exercising in a green environment, the positive effects were more apparent.\nLooking at men and women of different ages, the researchers found the health changes were particularly strong in the young and the mentally ill.\nGreen and blue\nA bigger effect was seen with exercise in an area that also contained water - such as a lake or river.\n\"This is because historically we are drawn to water to survive and it is in our genetic   make-up to be at one with nature,\" the researchers wrote in their report.\nPretty said those who were generally inactive, or stressed, or with mental illness would probably benefit the most from \"green exercise\".\n\"Employers, for example, could encourage staff in stressful workplaces to take a short walk at lunchtime in the nearest park to improve mental health.\"\nHe also said exercise programs outdoors could benefit youth offenders.", "id": "high8206.txt"}
