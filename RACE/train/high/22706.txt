She was the underdog who never saw the tournament on TV as a girl in China and never thought she'd get far on the red clay of the French Open, one of the four tennis Grand Slams  . \nBut it was Li Na who fell on her back in triumph  on June 4. Nearly two hours' hitting gave Li a 2-0 victory over Francesca Schiavone of Italy and made her the only tennis player, man or woman, from Asia to take home a Grand Slam title.\nChinese media have been swept along by the praise. An editorial carried by Xinhua News Agency said \"Li Na is the best PR (Public Relations) for China,\" and called her an \"outstanding name card for the country\" and a \"brilliant diplomat\". It compared Li to Chinese NBA star Yao Ming, noting that both \"can speak very fluent English, and both of them have a kind of sense of humor that is appreciated by foreigners\".\nSuccess has come late for Li. She once gave up tennis for two years and studied journalism at Wuhan's Huazhong University of Science and Technology. But in 2004, she returned and continues to play the best tennis she could.\n\"Dream comes true,\" Li said after the match. \"I am so happy that my efforts have paid off.\" Li has often been seen as a rebel , or at least a representative of a new generation. She has a tattoo , has dyed her hair many different color1s and has even been known to yell at her husband in public. \"The plain-speaking, tattooed, individualist has the ability to transcendthe sport and become a global star\", the BBC news reported.\nNo matter how important the French Open championship is, Li is not resting on her laurels  -- she's already thinking about winning a second major title. \"When you have the first one, naturally you will think about the second one. Now I have more confidence playing on other surfaces,\" Li told China Daily, as she prepares for the Wimbledon Championship, which will start on June 20.", "id": "high22706.txt"}
