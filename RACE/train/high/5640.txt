And the two of them said, \"It's unbelievable!\"\nNine-year-old, Rubina Ali, and Azharuddin Ismail, 10, were living a very different life and obviously loving every minute of it. The two, some of the child stars of the Oscar-winning Slum dog Millionaire(<<>> )movie, know the Indian slums very well. That was where they grew up, and it is where they will return at the end of their Hollywood dream trip.\nBut before going back home, there was an interview with the host, Ryan Seacrest. During the interview they smiled and repeated their disbelief in what was happening to them. To their surprise, their movie won first place in the Oscars. When the two received the award, it was late morning in the children's home city of Mumbai, where family, friends and many fellow residents of the slums watched the result from Hollywood.\n\"I don't really know what the Oscars are,\" Rubina's mother said. \"I'm just glad my daughter looks happy, though she told me she missed Indian food.\"\n\"Our children lead a dog's life,\" Rubina's mother said, pointing out the rubbish everywhere, the open drains   and the lack of education opportunities.\nIn a few days they will be back in Mumbai and back in the slums which are their home. Fortunately, according to media reports, the movie's director, Danny Boyle, has promised to help the children chosen from the slum and make sure they will go to a proper school.\nThe two don't need to worry about their daily lives because of the Oscar success of Slum dog Millionaire. But the poverty and lack of opportunity --the central theme of the movie--is always all around.", "id": "high5640.txt"}
