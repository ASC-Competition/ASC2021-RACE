Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities and the growing use of man-made materials. \nWhat can explain and solve the problem? The fact is that pollution is caused by man--by his desire for a modern way of life. We make \"increasing industrialization\" our chief aim.
