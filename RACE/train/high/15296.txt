Some 120 people applied and took the exam. Applicants were required to show proof of a college degree at least.\nMei Jing beat everyone in the test and the interview. When a follow-up check was done, however, her education certificate  was discovered to be an unreal one.\nThis was a bit of an embarrassment for the employers. A _ one might say. If she were hired because of her excellent performance, she still wouldn't have the qualifications on paper. But, if she were dropped because she didn't meet the education requirements, they would lose a good worker. Tough problem!\nWhile Mei's future hangs in the balance, the public having learned of the case got involved. Some people said the Bureau should employ her, since results are the only important thing. \"After all, ability is more important than a diploma, \"said one office worker.\nOthers, however, have attacked Mei's dishonesty. They said that morality was, after all, more important than talent, especially in the case of a government position. Mei wasn't honest, so she shouldn't be hired.\nBut, Shen Ronghua, the head of the Shanghai Public Administration and Human Resources Institute, tries to be a bit more philosophical.\n\"There is still a sort of  'diploma means this'  prejudice among people,\" Shen explains, \"Many employers regard a diploma as the only sign of ability and talent.\"\nSo, with this in mind, people may pay little attention to whether someone has real ability or not. They turn to chasing a diploma instead. The unreal diploma is the natural product of this thought.\nThe conclusion? \"China needs a new human resource system. The new system will not define a person only by his or her diploma, \" Shen says.", "id": "high15296.txt"}
