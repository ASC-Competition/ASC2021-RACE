It would also run to India and Pakistan, according to Wang Mengshu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a senior consultant on China's high-speed rail project.\nA second project would see trains heading north through Russia to Germany and into the European railway system, and a third line will extend south to connect Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Malaysia.\nMr. Wang said that the rail lines will draw together and open up the whole of Central, East and Southeast Asia, which would also allow China to transport valuable raw materials more efficiently.\nMr. Wang said the route of the three lines had yet to be decided, but that construction for the South East Asian line had already begun in the southern province of Yunnan and that Burma was about to begin building its link. China has offered to supply money to the Burmese line in exchange for the country's rich reserves of lithium, a metal widely used in batteries.\nAt present, the only rail line that links China to South East Asia is an old track built by the French in Vietnam a century ago. The Asian Development Bank has recently agreed a second PS27 million loan   as part of the PS93 reconstruction of Cambodia's network, which should finish by 2013. The cost of the lines from Cambodia to Singapore and then from Vietnam to China could be roughly PS400 million.", "id": "high22769.txt"}
