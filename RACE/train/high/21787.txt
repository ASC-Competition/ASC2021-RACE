It was downpouring   outside, Though I was holding an umbrella, my trouser legs as well as my shoes and socks still got wet. Entering the conference hall, I shook the umbrella, and at the same time, stamped my feet. Suddenly I caught sight of my chief boss strolling in.\n     At that time,I just got the job.Therefor,I hurriedly went to meet this superior in the highest rank and introduced myself to him as I was a new comer.He said,\"Yes,I recognize you.Got your feet wet?\"I lowered my head to look at my wet trouser legs and with a helpless tone,I said,\"Yeah,It's raining cats and dogs,isn't it?\"Gazing at me for a moment,the chief boss said nothing with a amile.\nLater on, I mentioned the incident of meeting the chief boss to my colleague. Hence I learnt that I had made a big fool of myself. It turns out that \"Get one's feet wet\" is an American slang , with the meaning of reaching the state of affairs.\" However, I regarded myself as humorous and replied with a slang sentence, which is seldom used now, describing the rain falling heavily. This was completely off the point. I am lucky that the chief boss is really gentle and did not point it out at once.", "id": "high21787.txt"}
