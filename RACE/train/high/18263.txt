She looked at data from national surveys of about 6,400 teens and young adults.\nCrossman presented her findings in Philadelphia at the American Sociological Association's annual meeting.\nWhat is Obesity?\nHealthy Habits\nParticipants who grew up to have a healthy weight had some common traits. As teens, they ate breakfast, had good self-esteem, and were too busy to spend tons of time watching TV or playing computer games. Their parents also had some things in common: healthy weight, more education, and control over their kids' diets. Parents' income and kids' race didn't make a difference, notes Crossman.\nFood for Thought\nMany factors affect weight, but \"our research suggests that prevention must begin at home,\" writes Crossman. Healthy eating and active lifestyles are part of the solution she recommends.\nPhysical activity is promoted as part of a healthy life (get a doctor's OK first). In this study, \"active\" didn't always mean tons of exercise. Teen's part-time jobs, volunteer activities, and hobbies also helped by reducing time with TV or computer games, notes Crossman.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children at risk should be identified by virtue of family history of obesity, and other factors such as environment. Parents and caregivers should be encouraged to promote healthy eating patterns by offering nutritious snack such as fruit and vegetables, low-fat diary products, and whole grains; setting appropriate limits and modeling healthy food choices. They also recommend limiting television and viewing time to a maximum of two hours a day.", "id": "high18263.txt"}
