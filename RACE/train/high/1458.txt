More than two thousand metres above sea level, it lies in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains with the Ortiz Mountains to the southeast.\nSanta Fe was founded in 1609 by the Spanish  on an old Indian village.In 1680 the Indians seized the place but only held it for twelve years before the Spanish retook it. The city remained under Spanish rule until Mexico won its independence   in 1821. From then on it was a Mexican city until 1846 when it was taken over by American troops.\nWith a population of 48,953, Santa Fe is now the second largest city in the state. Because of its sunny weather, rich history and surrounding mountains, it is a good place for holiday makers. Besides hunting and skating in the mountains people enjoy shopping in the Indian and Spanish shops, which brings a large income to the city every year. In summer there is an international opera   season when operas are shown in a partly-roofed ,open-air theatre daily for people from all over the world.", "id": "high1458.txt"}
