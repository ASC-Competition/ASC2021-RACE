Chief constables should be able to fire any officer as part of budget cuts, ending a job for life. It also recommended that applicants should be able to enter the police service directly at inspector rank,and,\"after strict testing\",at superintendent rank.\nMr Winsor said:\"I think the public will be surprised that after passing a fitness test when they join the police,physical fitness is not tested again in a 30,35-year career.\"\nAn initial yearly test requiring officers to reach level 5'4 on the bleep test should be brought in by September next year. This is equal to an average speed of 8. 8kph(5.5mph) for three minutes 35 seconds,he said. But this should get tougher by September 2018,along similar lines to the test currently used in Northern Ireland. This includes climbing over walls and pulling bodies and was designed to reflect situations which\"police officers do and can become involved in\".\nMr Winsor expected that many officers would welcome the proposals,saying they would see it\"as a necessary protection for themselves and the public\".", "id": "high2574.txt"}
