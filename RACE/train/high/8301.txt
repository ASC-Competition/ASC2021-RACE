You've made friends since childhood, but you still don't know who your true friends are. Here are some signs to tell you if your friend is a true friend:\nAlways honest\nHonesty is important to keep a relationship alive. A true friend always tells you the truth. It may be hard sometimes but lying can destroy a friendship. It is important that your friend speaks honestly and never makes up stories.\nThere are always periods in your life when you have problems or difficulties. A true friend will always have time to listen to your problems and give advice. It may not be able to offer a solution to your problems but the fact that your friend made time to listen is a sign he/ she cares for you. Your friend is not a true friend if he/ she can never make time for you when you are in trouble. You also need to be reasonable and accept that your friend also has other things to do so he/she can't always listen immediately to your problems.\nAlways respectful \nA true friend will always respect your opinion no matter whether he/she agrees or not. Your true friend may disagree but never insists that he/she is correct.\nAlways understanding\nIt is possible that some problems will arise between you and your friend. A true friend will always be forgiving  and understanding even if it isn't his /her fault. We are all different people and we all make mistakes. A true friend is always forgiving and understanding because he/she doesn't want to take the risk of losing his/her best friend.", "id": "high8301.txt"}
