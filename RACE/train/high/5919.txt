Developed by Richard Berk, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, the software has already used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict which individuals on probation  or parole  are most likely to murder and to be murdered.\n\"When a person goes on probation or parole he is supervised  by an officer. The question is 'what level of supervision is appropriate?'\" said Berk. It used to be that parole officers used the person's criminal record, and their judgment to make decisions.\n\"This research replaces those _ ,\" he said.\nTechnology helps determine level of supervision. On average there is one murder for every 100,000 people. Even among high-risk groups the murder rate is one in 100. Predicting such a rare event is very difficult, but advances in computer technology works.\nYears ago, the researchers made a dataset of more than 60,000 various crimes. Using the software they developed, they found some much more likely to commit murder when paroled or probated. They could identify eight future murderers out of 100.\nBerk's software examines roughly two dozen variables , from criminal record to geographic location. The type of crimes, and more importantly, the age at which that crime was committed, were two of the most predictive variables.\n\"People assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future,\" said Berk. \" What really matters is what that person did as a young individual. Predicting future crimes sounds well. But we aren't anywhere near being able to do that.\"\n\"Berk's scientific answer leaves policymakers with difficult questions. By labeling one group of people as high risk, and supervise them closely, there should be fewer murders, which the potential victims should be happy about. It also means that those high-risk individuals will be supervised more aggressively. For human rights advocates, that means punishing people who, most likely, will not commit a crime in the future,\" said Bushway. \"It comes down to a question of whether you would rather make these errors or those errors.\"", "id": "high5919.txt"}
