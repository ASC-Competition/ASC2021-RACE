Meanwhile, millions of poor Americans go hungry, without access to healthy and affordable meals. Evan Lutz, CEO and founder of Hungry Harvest, was inspired to act after seeing extreme poverty in areas of Baltimore. Maryland. He wants to reduce the so-called food desert in that area. His work is to make sure to food goes to waste and no person is ever hungry in America. And he combines that goal with a love for business.\nHungry Harvest is a business which collects and sells fruits and vegetables that most food companies will throw away. Everything doesn't grow the same way on a farm. But all that is too big or too small gets thrown out. That is why everything in a grocery store looks similar. Hungry Harvest will box those imperfect ones and deliver them to customers once a week.\nFor every purchase, Hungry Harvest delivers healthy food to people in need. Hungry Harvest has recovered 300,000 pounds of produce to date and provided 100,000 pounds to those in need.\nLutz established Hungry Harvest in 2014. Its success depends on team work. Every week on Monday or Tuesday they will decide what will go into the next week's box by calling up packing houses and wholesalers to see what they will normally throw away that week. They then place the order. The last step is to send goods to customers.\nIn January 2016, Lutz appeared on the American business competition television show \"Shark Tank\" and got even more than he expected: $100,000. Lutz is using the money to expand. Actually, more than six billion pounds are wasted each year due to \"ugly\" surface. Hungry Harvest is on the way to saving more food from going to waste and feeding hungry families.", "id": "high19961.txt"}
