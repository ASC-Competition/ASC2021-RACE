The State Council has organized an investigation team to probe   into what caused the disaster in the city of Linfen, North China's Shanxi Province. Preliminary  investigations show the illegal mining of an unauthorized seam , and the number of miners who had been sent down the shaft far exceeded its capacity.\nThis mine was found to have long ignored the rules to steal state coal, and did not have a list of miners employed to check the number of miners missing after the accident.\nHow did such a coal mine get all the necessary licenses for production? How did it pass the three safety inspections the local government organized last month?\nIn response to this disaster, the Shanxi governor promised to set up hotlines for people to report illegal coal mines and rewards as high as 100,000 yuan for _ \nWe appreciate the action this governor has taken to solving the coal mining problems, and we believe that the reporting scheme will help to stop the existence of illegal coal mines.\nBut at the same time we have reason to question how governments at various levels supervise these mines.\nThe sad fact that such a mine with serious safety problems could pass three consecutive  local government safety inspections in a month is enough to tell us how ineffective the safety inspections were.\nWhat if these inspections were just a formality ? What if the inspectors were bribed by the mine owners to turn a blind eye to the safety dangers? We can well imagine what would happen if reports about mine problems were handled by such officials.\nSo a thorough probe must find out who are responsible for the death of so many miners. A real safety inspection and management system must be established to guarantee that safety dangers will be removed.", "id": "high22171.txt"}
