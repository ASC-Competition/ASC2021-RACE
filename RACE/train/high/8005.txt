After he got back, some of his friends came. \"I had a very dangerous trip while I was in Russia,\" Larry said. \"I went to see a friend in the country when the sun went down, I was still travelling through a forest in a sleigh . It was a long way from my friend's house when about twenty wolves began to follow my sleigh.\" www.ks5u.com\n\"It was very dark in the forest. There was thick snow on the ground. First I heard the wolves. The noise was terrible! Then I saw long, grey forms among the trees, and soon the wolves were near me. They were running very fast, and they didn't seem to get tired like the horses.\"\n\"What did you do?\" one of Larry's friends asked.\n\"When the wolves got very near,\" Larry answered, \"I put up my gun and shot the first wolf dead. Then all the other wolves stopped and ate it, so my sleigh got away from them for a few minutes. Then they finished their meal, and I heard them coming again. The moon was shining brightly on the snow now, and after a few minutes I saw them running among the trees once more. They came nearer again, and then I shot another one of them, and the others stopped once more to eat it. The same thing happened again, and my horses became more and more tired and ran slower and slower until, after two hours, only one wolf was still alive and following me.\"\n\"Wasn't it too fat to run?\" one of Larry's friends asked.", "id": "high8005.txt"}
