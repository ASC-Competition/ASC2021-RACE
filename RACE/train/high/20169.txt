He lived with an American family. One day, he went to his room in the evening, and did his homework. His host-mom came to him and asked if he would like to go along to the movies. He wanted to go, so he shook his head from side to side, said \"Yes\". His host-mom did a couple of steps back, and looked puzzled.\nShe thought that he didn't want to go out because he shook his head from side to side. However, he wanted to go out to the movies. Bulgarians shake their heads from side to side when they mean \"yes\". People in other countries shake their heads from side to side when they mean \"no\".\nGestures can have different meanings according to different cultures. For example, in America, putting your index finger  and your thumb  in a circle is commonly used as an OK sign that means everything is all right. However, in France, that sign is used to express \"nothing\" or \"zero\", which can have a negative meaning.\nGenerally speaking, gestures are a type of communication that uses a part of our body, and when speaking with people from other cultures, gestures can be important keys or clues to understand them. However, we need to understand that those gestures vary from culture to culture, and it is necessary for us to have an open mind in understanding the different gestures.", "id": "high20169.txt"}
