Below are four unusual places.\nThe Poseidon Resort\nThe Poseidon resort is an underwater resort that gives visitors a beautiful view of sea life. This resort covers 255 acres. It's covered and surrounded by a lagoon   that covers 5,000 acres and is about 90 feet under water, giving you a beautiful view of sea life right before your eyes. This resort even has a hotel for those who would prefer to have the unusual experience of sleeping and waking up to the beautiful scenery all around them.\nThe Sabeto Mud Pool\nIf you're looking for something unusual to do, you can't pass up the mud pool at Sabeto. It is located in a mountain range with a huge group of Geothermal pools full of nice, warm mud. Getting down and into the mud in the pool is believed to have benefits for healthy skin. This is unusual, but adults and especially kids will love it.\nFire Walking\nFire walking in Fiji is believed to have originated on the island of Beau. Fire walking is when you walk on white-hot stones barefoot. To do this, you have to be mentally prepared for it. Trust me; there is a lot of preparation and strict rules that travelers follow in order to do this safely.\nThe Fiji Museum\nThe Fiji museum is unusual due to all the amazing _ you'll see dating back 3,000-4,000 years. This museum has a certain attraction that makes it funny--a shoe. It's been said that a man named Thomas Baker was eaten by the locals several centuries ago and the only thing left was his shoe. This museum is a great idea if you bring the whole family to Fiji.", "id": "high4615.txt"}
