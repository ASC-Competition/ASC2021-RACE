However, that attitude was changed suddenly in 2007 when Amazon's Kindle came onto the market, which led to e-book sales jumping up to 1,260%. Since then, e-books' popularity has continued to rise steadily. The publishing industry seemed to have lost all possible ability to regain its position. Will printed books eventually become a thing of the past?\nAccording to Mike Shatzkin, founder and CEO of the Idea Logical Company, printed books just for plain old reading will, in 10 years from now, be unusual. \"Not so unusual that a kid will say, 'Mommy, what's that?' but unusual enough that on the train you'll see one or two people reading something printed, while everyone else is reading off of a tablet.\" And Shatzkin believes that the de mise of print is sure to happen, though such a day won't arrive for perhaps 50 to 100 or more years.\nRobert Stein, founder of the Institute for the Future of the Book, however, believes that books won't disappear entirely, at least not anytime soon. \"Print will exist, but it will be in a\ndifferent field and will appeal to a very limited audience, as poetry does today. Like woodblock printing, hand-processed film and folk weaving  , printed pages may assume an artistic\nvalue,\" he says. He imagines that future forms of books might be developed not by traditional publishers but by the gaming industry. He also predicts that the distinction between writer and reader will be made less obvious by a social reading experience in which authors and consumers can digitally interact with each other to discuss any passage, sentence or line.\nIs there anything we risk sacrificing, should print really disappear entirely? According to Maryanne Wolf, director of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University, electronic reading can negatively affect the way the brain responds to text, including reading comprehension, focus and the ability to maintain attention to details like plot and order of events. \"My worry is that we'll have a short-circuited reading brain, excellent for gathering information but not necessarily for forming critical, analytical deep reading skills,\" Wolf says.\n        The field, however, is in an early stage, and findings about the negative effects of e-reading are far from certain. In light of this, Wolf hopes that we continue to maintain a \"bi-literate\" society--one that values both the digital and printed word. \"A full reading brain circuit is a huge contribution to the intellectual development of our species. Anything that threatens it deserves our attention.\"", "id": "high19910.txt"}
