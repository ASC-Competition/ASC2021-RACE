Crows and parrots have the largest brains, while pheasants   have a relatively small brain.\nEarlier studies have shown there is a relationship between the size of the brain and an animal's capacity to create new behavior and adapt more easily.\n\"The idea is that if you have a big brain, you are more capable of adjusting behavior and responding to environmental changes. This can help you to survive,\" said Sol, who reported the finding in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.\nTamas Szekely of the University of Bath in England and a co-author of the report, said birds were ideal to test the hypothesis because they are the only species in which brain size and behavioral response to environmental challenges such as climate and habitat destruction is understood.", "id": "high8334.txt"}
