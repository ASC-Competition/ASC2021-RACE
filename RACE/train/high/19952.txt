I like that now I can throw a football further than when I didn't have hands,\" he said.\nThe nation's youngest hand-transplant patient has been working hard to learn how to use his new hands. He lost his hands and his feet 7 years ago after suffering a serious infection. In August, the boy showed off his new abilities by throwing out the first ball at a baseball game. Dr. Scott Levin, team leader of Zion's operation, said Zion coped with the operation better than many adults. \"I've never seen Zion cry,\" Levin said. \"He's just an amazing boy. He has such courage and determination and gives us all inspiration.\"\nZion said his courage came from the two most amazing people: his mom and his grandma. His mother, Pattie Ray, said, \"It's been a long journey but now I feel I am living in my dream. It's his dream, and it's mine, too. I' m just living through him, and I'm just here to support him in any way and help him do whatever he wants to do.\"\nHowever, Zion told reporters his mom wouldn't let him try out for football. His mom said it's too dangerous. She also pointed out that he might be playing against little kids, not professionals, and she told him they would discuss it later. Zion tried to counter her argument. \"My next goal: convince Mom to let me play football,\" he said.", "id": "high19952.txt"}
