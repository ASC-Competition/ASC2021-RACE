For two weeks I would try to be a loving husband and father.\nThe idea had come to me as I listened to a talk on my car radio. The speaker was quoting a Biblical   passage about husbands being thoughtful of their wives. Then he went on to say, \"Love is an act of will. A person can choose to love.\" To myself, I had to admit that I had been a selfish husband. Well, for two weeks that would change.\nAnd it did. Right from the moment I kissed Evelyn at the door and said, \"That new yellow sweater looks great on you.\"\n\"Oh, Tom, you noticed,\" she said, surprised and pleased. Maybe a little puzzled.\nAfter the long drive, I wanted to sit and read. Evelyn suggested a walk on the beach. I started to refuse, but then I thought, \"Evelyn's been alone here with kids all week and now she wants to be alone with me.\" We walked on the beach while the children flew the kites.\nSo it went. Two weeks of not calling the Wall Street firm where I am a director; a visit to the shell museum though I usually hate museums. Relaxed and happy, that's how the whole vacation passed. I made a new pledge to keep on remembering to choose love.\nThere was _ that went wrong with my experiment, however. Evelyn and I still laugh about it today. On the last night at our cottage, preparing for bed, Evelyn stared at me with the saddest expression. \"What's the matter?\" I asked her.\n\"Tom, \" she said in a voice filled with sadness, \"do you know something I don't?\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Well.....that checkup  I had several weeks ago..... our doctor ..... did he tell you something about me? Tom, you've been so good to me..... am I dying ?\"\nIt took a moment for it all to sink in. Then I burst out laughing.\n\"No, honey,\" I said, wrapping her in my arms. \"You're not dying; I'm just start to live.\"", "id": "high4989.txt"}
