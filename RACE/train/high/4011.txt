But forgiveness is possible and it can be surprisingly helpful to your physical and mental health. Indeed, research has shown that people who forgive report more energy, better appetite   and better sleep patterns. \"People who forgive show less anger and more hopefulness,\" says Dr. Frederic Luskin, who wrote the book Forgive for Good. \"So it can help save on the wear and tear, and allow people to feel more energetic.\"\nSo when someone has hurt you, calm yourself first. Take a couple of breaths and think of something that gives you pleasure: a beautiful scene in nature, someone you love. Don't wait for an apology. \"Many times the person who hurt you may never think of apologizing,\" says Dr. Luskin. \"They may have wanted to hurt you or they just don't see things the same way.
