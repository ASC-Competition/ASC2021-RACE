He wonders  : Can I communicate  with Americans? Can they understand me? Learners of English often ask: What are the differences between British and American English? How important are these differences?\nCertainly! there are some differences between British and American English. 'There are a few differences in grammar. For example, speakers of British English say \"in hospital\" and \"Have you a pen?\" Americans say \"in the hospital!\" and \"Do you have a pen?\". Pronunciation is sometimes different. Americans usually sound theirs in words like \"bird\" and \"hurt\". Speakers of British English do not sound theirs in these words. There are differences between British and American English in spelling and vocabulary. For example, \"colour\" and \"honour\" are British, \"color\" and honor\" are American.\nThese differences in grammar, pronunciation, spelling and vocabulary are not important, however. For the most part, British and American English are the same language.", "id": "high4642.txt"}
