A child was watching him. The old man was really good at fishing and it didn't take him much time to catch a basket of fish. The old man saw that the child was very cute, and he wanted to give her a whole basket of fish. But the child shook her head.\nThe old man was surprised and asked \"Why don't you want the fish?\"\nThe child replied,\"I want the fishing rod in your hands.\" The old man asked, \"Why do you want the rod?\"\n\"It won't take long to eat all the fish in the basket. But if I have the fishing rod, I can go fishing by myself and I won't be afraid of not having any fish to eat.\"\nI think you will certainly say that the girl is very smart. Wrong! If she doesn't know how to fish, she cannot have fish to eat, even though she has the fishing rod. It's useless to only have a fishing rod. Fishing skills are the most important, not the fishing rod.\nToo many people think that if they have a \"fishing rod\" in their life, they will no longer fear the difficulties in life. They are just like the child, who thought that if she had a fishing rod, she would have fish to eat.", "id": "high19052.txt"}
