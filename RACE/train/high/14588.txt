This finding is the result of an interesting study in 32 of the world's largest cities. Altogether, researchers \"lost\" 960 new mobile phones. They got back 654 of them, or 68 percent. Prague came in at number eight. There, 23 out of 30 people who were willing to return the mobile phone.\nIt wasn't a traditional study. Two researchers carefully chose different places, such as areas with high crime   and busy downtown shopping areas, to \"lose\" the phones. When one of the researchers dropped a phone, the other would keep watching from a distance. The honest finders tried their best to find the owner with the help of the address book in the phone. They were told why the study was done and asked why they acted the way they did.\nIt was found that the busier the place where the researchers dropped the phone, the greater the chance of it being returned. Another interesting finding was that women were generally more likely than men to return the phone. Researchers also found that most people still have a sense of honesty. \"Crime is simply not good behaviour  ,\" said an expert. \"People want to trust others, and want to be trusted.\"", "id": "high14588.txt"}
