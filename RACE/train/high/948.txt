Half the participants were told to color in squares and circles freely on a piece of paper while listening to the lecture.The other half weren't given a task.After it was over, the participants were asked to retell the lecture.\nThose given the doodling task(color in squares and circles)remembered 29 percent more information than the non-doodlers.Andrade said.\n\"If someone is doing a boring task,like listening to a dull conversation,they may start daydream,\"said Professor Andrade.\n\"Daydreaming distracts them from the task,resulting in poorer performance.A  simple task,like doodling,can stop them from daydreaming without affecting their performance at the task,\"he said.\nSo the next time you're doodling during a class,and you hear\"pay attention\",you can tell  the teacher with confidence that you've been paying attention to every word.", "id": "high948.txt"}
