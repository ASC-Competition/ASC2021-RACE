His talent in singing did not come up as a surprise, as he had a good voice right from his childhood. When Elvis was ten years old, he participated in a Talent Contest at Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show and won a prize for the song he sang. \nWhen Elvis was 13 years old, his family moved to Tennessee. To support himself and his father, Elvis took on a job as a truck driver. A disc containing two ballads   that Elvis had recorded for his mother as a birthday gift was first heard by Sun Studio's president Sam Phillips. After listening to Elvis, Sam made Elvis an offer and that was the birth of a new singing sensation ; a new superstar was born. In 1954 his first record was released from Sun Studio.\nIn 1955, Elvis singed a $35,000 recording contract with RCA Victor (through Thomas Parker), who promised to help in projecting Elvis Presley (a Local Star) as a National Level Star. As promised, Elvis was shown in newspapers, television appearances, photographs where he was claimed to be the next superstar of the music world.\nIn 1956, his first performance with \"Heartbreak Hotel\" on The Milton Berle Show successfully put Elvis on the top list of the superstars and the nationwide \"Elvis Craze\" was started. Elvis became the prince who ruled hearts of his millions of fans.\nIn 1960, he quit performing in concerts and concentrated in making movies. As his first movie Love Me Tender was a big hit, he had no problem in marking his comeback in movies.\nAfter making several very successful and hit movies, Elvis returned to the world of music. In 1968, Elvis once again started working with his old band and gave some more smashing   hits to the world. In 1972, he released his last top-ten single Burning Love. \nIt's nearly impossible to measure the level of popularity he had reached in his career. Elvis Presley had more than 100 records on the billboard charts and out of which, about 18 records were on number one position on the charts. During his lifetime, he worked in about 31 movies; all of them were huge success.", "id": "high21316.txt"}
