But I know the truth about that. My mother found out from Troubled's mother.

So now they buy presents and pretend they're from Santa.\"\n\"What did Troubled do to get Santa so mad?\" Trogmire questioned.\n\"I think it had something to do with the time he put glue paper all over the living room floor on Christmas Eve, and left a sign that said, 'Trapped like a rat!' hanging over the fireplace.\" said Tremor.\n\"I guess Santa doesn't have a sense of humour,\" sighed Trogmire. \"Well, at least I'm not the only one who Santa scratched off his name list.\"", "id": "high15403.txt"}
