The car ride to the airport followed by a two-hour flight left our legs more worse condition than they were when we first came off the mountain we just climbed.\nWhen we heard that two seats in first class on our next flight were available for a bit higher price, we jumped at the opportunity. Our spirits lifted immediately. After all, flying first class was a new experience for us, and we would end our adventure in comfort and style.\nAs we boarded the plane, we noticed that the stewardess  was working non-stop to ensure the comfort of the first class passengers. She could not walk by a seat without receiving an order. How much she must love her job! She smiled kindly at each one while attending to their needs.\nAs the stewardess walked by our seats near the end of the flight, I looked at her and said, \"Thank you and I hope you have a great night.\" She stopped, bent down, looked at me and said, \"Excuse me.\" I repeated my words and she smiled in a rather funny way, almost as if I had asked her a question that she did not know how to answer.\nAfter a few moments she returned to our seats. \"I can tell you work with the public,\" she said. \"Why do you think so?\" I asked. She answered very quietly, \"Because you are the only passenger here to say something nice to me tonight and I really appreciate your kindness.\"\nThe sense of belonging to the elite  group of people in first class disappeared as we heard her words. Our first class seats offered us more than a comfortable ride. We were reminded that without kindness, we would be flying in no class.", "id": "high6.txt"}
