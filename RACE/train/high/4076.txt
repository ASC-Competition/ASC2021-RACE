Bicycles also come in different colours---silver,green,red,blue,yellow,whatever you want.\nIt's fun watching people biking. They rush quickly through crossroads,move skillfully through traffic,and ride even on sidewalks . Bicycles allow people the freedom to move about that cars just can't provide.\nEager to be part of this aspect of Chinese culture, I decided to buy a bicycle. Great weather accompanied my great buy. I immediately jumped up on my bicycle seat and started to ride.\nMy first ride home was orderly .To be safe,I stayed with a \"pack\"of bikers while cars on the streets came running swiftly out of nowhere at times. I didn't want to get hit.So I took the ride carefully.\nCrossing the streets was the biggest problem. It was a lot like crossing a major highway back in the United States. The streets here were wide,so crossing took time,skill and a little bit of luck.\nI finally made it home. The feeling on the bicycle was amazing. The air hitting my face and going through my air was wonderful. I was sitting on top of the world as I passed by places and people.Biking made me feel alive.", "id": "high4076.txt"}
