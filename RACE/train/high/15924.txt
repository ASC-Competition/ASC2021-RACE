But a new survey in America finds almost as many also fear the online world--especially social networking sites such as My Space--and worry their kids will get in trouble with people they meet.\n\"The parents see the web's incredible potential , and they know their kids have to be there.\" says James Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, which released results from a survey that looked into parental attitudes toward the Internet. \"\nis also what they are scared of most.\"\nThe study was conducted online May 5-10 by Insight Research Group. It says 80% of parents are concerned about kids meeting bad people online. That's because young people who largely have grown up with the Net think of it as a social outlet , say the researchers. To young people, the benefits of giving out some personal information to reach out to friends outweigh the risks. And the study shows they are so comfortable with the medium that 78% have a personal website or blog.\nParents also recognize the importance of the Internet. The survey shows 91% think the Net helps their children explore their passions, and 77% think the Internet is one of the most valuable education tools teens have. But 88% think it's important to know what their kids are doing online.\nFindings suggest both parents and teens need more education about using online media, Steyer says.\nInternet safety has become an increasing concern for parents in America. Organizations like the Non-profit Common Sense have been trying to reach and help parents pay attention to the problem.", "id": "high15924.txt"}
