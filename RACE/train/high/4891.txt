Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago.\" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. \"It's surprising, but exciting!\" she said. Marc simply said, \"We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!\"\nThe Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.\nWhat they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection.", "id": "high4891.txt"}
