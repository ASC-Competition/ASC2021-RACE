These special people are called psychics. Some believe that we all have this ability to some degree but that most of us choose not to develop it.\n              Many people are skeptical about ESP. Alongside the existence of documented evidence, there are plenty of claims that have turned out to be cheating. For most people, it is difficult to accept such claims without having had first hand experience. The lack of scientific evidence is another factor to take into account. On the other hand, most of us have, at some time, experienced a seemingly unexplainable occurrence; hearing the telephone ring and knowing who will be on the other end of the line or cases of coincidence that seem to be too extreme to be accidental.\n              Over the years there have been numerous ESP experiments conducted by serious scientists in serious institutions. Joseph Banks Rhine, a botanist at Duke University published a famous book in 1934 called \"Extra-Sensory Perception\" in which he claimed to have enormous evidence of ESP. However, other scientists have been unable to copy his results since, which has resulted in the book losing much of its original credibility and fame.\n              The Ganzfield Experiments are considered to have been the most carefully examined ESP experiments. So-called psychics had their eyes covered and ears blocked while a \"sender\" attempted to transmit messages. Later the psychics would compare the messages received to the original messages sent out. There was a great deal of excitement and interest at the time, but the research failed to produce convincing results.\n              One of the strongest criticisms against ESP is that in order for it to exist, the fundamental laws of physics would necessarily have to be broken.\n              Human beings are attracted to the whole range of supernatural phenomena. ESP will always continue to fascinate. This becomes clear when we see how much of the media is dedicated to the topic: magazines, journals, web sites, television and radio programs. Some of the most successful films in recent years have fuelled interest among the younger generations who are starting to ask the same questions and to look for explanations for the same phenomena as their parents and grandparents before them. Who knows? One day we might just find these answers because one thing is certain: \"The truth is out there! \"", "id": "high17858.txt"}
