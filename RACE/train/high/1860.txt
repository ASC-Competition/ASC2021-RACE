Researchers at the University of Cambridge discovered that Welsh mountain sheep have brainpower that equals rodents  . Tests found that the sheep can map the area they live in, and some may even be able to plan ahead.\nYoung fish prefer noisy neighbors\nA new study has shown that young fish like to live on reefs with noisy neighbors! Researchers from the universities of Auckland and Bristol found that young fish looking for a home choose areas where other noisy fish live. The scientists produced all kinds of sounds which had been recorded in different natural environments. The young fish seemed to prefer the sounds of natural reefs, complete with noisy animals! The scientists compared the choice to a music fan wandering around at a music festival, choosing to set up a tent closest to the music they like best!\nButterflies are disappearing\nA new study has shown that 17 species   of butterfly found in Europe have dropped by 70% in the last 20 years.
