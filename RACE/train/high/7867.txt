If you need a refresher or you haven't been on a bike for a while and want to start cycling or perhaps you're confident on traffic-free routes but you want to start cycling on the road, our instructors can teach you the skills you need to cycle safely and confidently on the road. This is Level 2.\nExperienced Cyclist? If you are an experienced cyclist, our professional urban coaches can give you smart tips for negotiating complex junctions more easily and improving your rush-hour strategies. This is Level 3.\nWhat you should bring: You will need a roadworthy bike for your lesson. If you don't own a bike you can hire one for the duration of your lesson but you can only hire one from the instructors at our Bedminster and St George venues. The cost of the bike for hire is PS5.
