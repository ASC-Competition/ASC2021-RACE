One of those things is being called \"strong\".\nThe first time was last December. I was walking across the high school campus in Guangzhou where I taught when a student in a gray scarf waved hello. I smiled and waved back, but then she stopped and called my name. \"You're so strong!\" She smiled and pointed at what appeared to be my arm.\nI looked down at my arms. Let's get one thing clear: I'm a very skinny guy. Once, while rehearsing for a high school talent show, I was told by the teacher in charge that I couldn't participate in the men's shirtless dance routine because my visible rig cage  would frighten the audience.\n\"I'm so what?\" \"You're so strong!\" _ repeated. \"Um, thanks!\" I didn't know what else to say, so we both waved goodbye.\nThe next morning I stepped into my oral English classroom only to be greeted instantly by a unanimous  \"Waaa!\" of shock and admiration. \"What?\" I asked. \"You're so strong!\" shouted a boy from the back of the class.\n\"Okay, will someone tell me what that means?\" I was curious as to the real reason for such praise. So I turned to the monitor, gesturing for him to speak.\n\"We just mean, you look very strong today,\" he offered earnestly.\n\"What?! You mean like this?\" I curled my arm like a bodybuilder.\n\"No! But it's so cold, and you're only wearing a shortsleeve shirt.\"\nOh, I got it. My \"strength\" had less to do with my muscle and more to do with my apparent ignorance of the cold weather.", "id": "high8327.txt"}
