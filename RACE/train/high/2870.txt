Cards, flowers, sales, TV specials, and a day off for someone who really deserves it --those are what probably come to mind for many people when they think of Mother's Day. But there's more about the story.\nThe earliest Mother's Day celebrations were held during spring in Ancient Greece. The celebrations honored Rhea, the Mother of the gods. During the 1600s, England celebrated a day called Mothering Sunday. On this day even servants   were given the day off to spend with their families. A mothering cake was even served with the family meal.\nIn the U.S., Mother's Day began in 1872 when Julia Ward Howe, who wrote the words of the famous song The Battle Hymn of the Republic, suggested it as a day devoted to peace. But it didn't really become popular until 1907 when Anna Jarvis started a campaign   to honor her own mother. She believed that mothers could help people get over the pain they experienced during the Civil War. The U.S. isn't alone in devoting a day to its mothers. Many other countries including Denmark, Finland, Italy, Turkey, Australia, Japan, and Belgium also celebrate their Mother's Day in May. Other countries honor their mothers at different times of the year.\nLearning more about Mother's Day and celebrating Mother's Day is important, but probably not as important as understanding what your own mother, or grandmother, or aunt has really done for you. And that should certainly be appreciated more than one day in a year.", "id": "high2870.txt"}
