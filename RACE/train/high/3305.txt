When they looked down, they could even see their new body and clothes.\nThe \"body-swapping\" effect was so convincing that the men's sense of self was transferred into the virtual woman, causing them to react to events in the virtual world they wereimmersed . \"This work opens up another avenue for virtual reality, which is not just to transform your sense of place, but also your sense of self,\" said Mel Slater, \"If you can temporarily give people the illusion that their bodies are different, then the evidence suggests it also affects their behavior and the way they think. They can have new experiences: a person who is thin can know what it is like to be fat. A man can have an experience of what it's like to be a woman.\"\nDuring the experiment, a \"female\" approached and hit the face of the character another man was playing. \"Their reaction was immediate,\" said Slate. \"They would take in a quick breath and maybeflinch . The more people reported being in the girl's body, the stronger physical reaction they had.\" But in all cases, the feeling was temporary and lasted only as long as the study.\nThe study shows that our minds have a very fluid picture of our bodies. The research is expected to shed light on the puzzle of how our brain tells the difference between a part of our own body and something else in the wider world. Thus the work might improve the conditions for those who have experienced strokes by placing them in a world that helps them to use their bodies to the full again.", "id": "high3305.txt"}
