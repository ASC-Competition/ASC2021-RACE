Some dances are fast and others are slow. People's feet always move when they dance. They keep on moving until the music stops.\nPeople have enjoyed dancing for a very long time. This story is of a different kind of dance. It is a dance without people or music. Yet this dance is one of the oldest in the world. It is the dance of bees.\nIf you have ever watched bees, you know that they are very clever. They also work hard looking for food and bringing it back to their home.\nThe home of the bees is called a bee hive. Here hundreds even thousand of bees live. They work day and night building small walls. There they make their honey. This is the same honey that we eat.\nWhere does the honey come from? Bees live on food from flowers. Have you seen bees flying around a flower garden? When a bee rests on a flower, it tries to go to the centre of it. There it takes in as much food as its body can hold. Then it flies to take the food back to the hive.\nAt the hive, bees change flower food into honey. Then they fly away for more food.\nHow do the bees know where to find the best food in the sweetest flowers? One bee acts as a guide. When it discovers good flowers, it flies back to the hive and tells the others. It does this by dancing for them.\nThe bee dances on one side. This tells the other bees which way to go to find the flowers. But that is not all. The bee dances for some time. And the length of its dance tells the other bees how far they must fly to reach the flowers.\nWhen the bees see the dance, they know where the flowers are. They fly away and return with more food for the hive.\nSometimes we hear the music of the bees as they fly around. But few people have ever seen them dance. Yet without that dance we might never have sweet honey to eat.", "id": "high403.txt"}
