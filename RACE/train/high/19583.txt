At Relay, teams of people camp out at a local high school, park, or an open place and take turns in walking or running around a track or path. Each team is asked to have a representative on the track at all times during the event. Because cancer never sleeps, it's an overnight event of up to 24 hours in length.\nHistory of Relay for Life:\nRelay began in 1985 when Dr. Klatt, a surgeon in Tacoma, Washington, ran and walked around a track for 24 hours to raise money for the American Cancer Society. Since then, Relay has grown from a single man's passion for fighting cancer into the world's largest movement to end the disease. Each year, more than 3.5 million people in 5,000 communities in the United States, along with additional communities in 19 other countries, gather to take part in this global event and raise much-needed funds and awareness to save lives from cancer.\nRequirements for Relay for Life:\nAnyone can participate in Relay for Life. Friends, families, neighbors, classmates, sports teams, etc., can form their own teams. No matter who you are, there's a place for you at Relay.\nThe only requirement to participate in Relay for Life is the $10 registration/commitment fee per person. After that, anything you can raise through individual, team, or online fundraising is accepted. It is recommended that each participant sets a personal goal to raise $100. If you raise more, that's even better. Even if you do not raise $100, you are still welcome to participate.\nIf you want to be part of Relay, you can start a team or join an existing team online. You can also make an online donation. By supporting Relay, you help the American Cancer Society save lives, and that helps us move closer to our ultimate goal of a world with less cancer and more birthdays.\nOnline Help:\nPlease check our Online Help&FAQ page for answers to commonly asked questions about online fundraising and about Bark For Life.\nLocal Help:\nIf you have questions that are not answered by the Online Help&FAQ page, or if you would like assistance from your local event representative, feel free to contact Jill Tetherow at (402) 310-2498, or jill.tetherow@cancer.org.\nCancer Information&Help:\nFor cancer information and support at any time, visit cancer.org or call 18002272345 to speak to one of our highly trained cancer information specialists.
