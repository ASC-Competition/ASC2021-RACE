And I remember one night in particular when she had made breakfast after a long, hard day at hospital.\nOn that evening so long ago, my Mom placed a plate of eggs, sausage and extremely burned toast in front of my dad. I remember waiting to see if anyone noticed! Yet all my dad did was reach for his toast, smile at my Mom and ask me how my day was at school. I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him spread butter and jelly on that toast and eat every bite!\nWhen I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my Mom apologize to my dad for burning the toast. And I'll never forget what he said: \"Honey, I love burned toast.\"\nLater that night, I went to kiss Daddy good night and I asked him if he really liked his toast burned. He took me in his arms and said, \"Your Momma put in a hard day at work today and she's really tired. And besides - a little burned toast never hurt anyone!\"\nYou know, life is full of imperfect things and imperfect people. What I've learned over the years is that learning to accept each other's faults is one of the most important keys to creating a healthy, growing, and lasting relationship. This good quality is the base of any relationship --- husband-wife or parent-child or friendship! As far as I'm concerned, I'm not the best engineer as expected. However, I have made my efforts. That's enough.\nSo learn to take the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of your life. Burnt toast isn't a deal-breaker! Don't put the key to your happiness in someone else's pocket but into your own.", "id": "high6367.txt"}
