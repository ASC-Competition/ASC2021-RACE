And in a final test at the same level as the first ,their scores improved by 25 percent. And the \"smart\" kids? They refused to try the harder puzzles, choosing the one that guaranteed them good scores. When they did work in the \"too hard\" tests , they became discouraged and upset. And when retested with the original puzzles, their scores declined by 20 percent.\nDweck's conclusion:\"When we praise kids for their intelligence,we tell them:  'Look smart,don't risk making mistakes.'\"By contrast,\"emphasizing effort gives children an inspiring factor that they can control.\"", "id": "high16985.txt"}
