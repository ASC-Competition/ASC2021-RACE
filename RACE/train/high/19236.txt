She must be.'.Well, I've forgotten how old she'd be now!\"\nMy smile froze and my hands began to shake. My grandmother had Alzheimer's disease. It seemed impossible for her to be unable to look after herself. Gradually, not remembering where she placed her glasses became not remembering where her house was, which became not always remembering my name.
