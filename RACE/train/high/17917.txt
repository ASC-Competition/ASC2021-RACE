When he went to work on Monday morning, he had never thought that he would spend the next week in the ruins of his workplace. \"It was a miracle , but that happened through our hard work,\" said Zhao Hongxing, an army doctor who joined in rescue. \"His first words were 'The army is great. '\"\nChinese troops may have been the ones to physically free Mr Liu, 50, but it was his daughter who didn't give up looking for her father that saved his life at last. On Thursday night, running around the fallen factory, the family search party headed by his daughter, heard a low cry. \"Father! Father!\" Mr Liu answered in a low voice \"Yes\". Then, after more than three days buried under the fallen building, came two simple words: \"I'm thirsty\". The reply was probably not what he was wanting: \"Father don't talk! You need your air! I will go and find somebody to rescue you!\"\nThe entire first floor of the building fell down, with the second floor completely damaged and pushing the building to one side. The 12-hour rescue operation to save Mr Liu was filled with danger. Mr Liu was freed yesterday at 6:28 p. m. His family had agreed to cut off one of his feet so that he could be pulled out. \"I just want him to live,\" his daughter Yuan, 23, said in tears. \nMr Liu, wrapped in a blanket, was welcomed by a large number of people who was concerned about him. And with the latest survivor taken to a waiting ambulance , the rescue workers went back to the ruins where two more factory workers were waiting for their turn to be dug out.", "id": "high17917.txt"}
