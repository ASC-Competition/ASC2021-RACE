There is one particular blue flower that has always caught my eye. I've noticed that it blooms only in the morning hours. The afternoon sun is too warm for it. Every day each year for about two weeks, I see those beautiful flowers.\nThis spring, I started a wildflower garden in my yard. I can look out of the kitchen window while doing the dishes and see the flowers. I've often thought that those lovely blue flowers from the fields would look great in that bed alongside other wildflowers.\nEvery day I drove past the flowers, thinking, \"I'll stop on my way home and dig them.\" \"Gee, I don't want to get my good clothes dirty...\" Whatever the reason, I never stopped to dig them. My husband even gave me a tool one year for that expressed purpose.\nOne day on my way home from work, I was saddened to see that the highway department had cleared up the fields and the pretty blue flowers were gone. I thought to myself, \"Way to go, you waited too long. You should have done it when you first saw them blooming this spring. \"\nA week ago we were shocked and saddened to learn that my oldest sister-in-law has a cancer. She is 20 years older than my husband and unfortunately, because of age and distance, we haven't been as close as we all would have liked.\nI couldn't help but see the connection between the pretty blue flowers and the relationship between my husband's sister and us. I do believe that God has given us some time left to plant some wonderful memories that will bloom every year for us.\nAnd yes, if I see the blue flowers again, I'm sure I'll stop and transplant them to my wildflower garden.", "id": "high3222.txt"}
