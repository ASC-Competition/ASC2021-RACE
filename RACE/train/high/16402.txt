As one travels the countryside, you'll find more of its treasures: so many plants and animals, romantic castles , secret gardens, and villages so unchanged in the last decades that they seem to have been caught under a fairy' s spell.\nMust-sees include Derbyshire, called \"the heart of England\" and home to the National Park. The great peaks were the muse of the Bronte sisters (and if you love the book Jane Eyre, you can visit North Lees hall, where the real Eyre family once lived).\nHistory lovers will enjoy a visit to Lincoln city (its most famous son is Lord Alfred Tennyson). It is also known for its cathedral , the charming tea shops, a small castle. One would never guess its violent past--built by Romans, it was once a center for arrow  making.\nHarry Potter fans shouldn't miss a visit to Alnwick, which is better recognized as the \"Hogswarth\" in the movies.\nLet's not leave out the Wessex region, where one can see one of England's greatest mysteries, Stone Henge. You can also go to the City of Bath, which has been famous for its medicines springs since the Roman times. Other popular tractions include Salisbury Cathedral, and landscaped  gardens of Stourhead, and the cobbled  streets of Shaftesbury. This is also home to Oxford, one of the world's most famous universities.\nArt lovers will also like a visit to East Anglia, whose landscapes inspired the painter Constable (he was born in Dedham village). This is also home of the University City of Cambridge, and the famous architectural  attraction, King's College Chapel. Be sure to visit the aircraft museum of Duxford.", "id": "high16402.txt"}
