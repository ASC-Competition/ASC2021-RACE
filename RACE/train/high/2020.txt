What would you miss most and least if you were stuck on a desert island? For me, it would be the changing seasons in New England. I guess this will sound stupid but I'd probably miss the rain, too. I would not miss getting up at six every day to go to work, though! What about you?\nPost 2\nTomas\nGermany Good question. Steve, I think I'd miss different types of bread, and shopping at the supermarket. I'd miss the food most. What would I miss least? My mobile phone---I'd like to be completely quiet --- at least for a little while\nPost 3\nPaola\nItaly I would miss the company of people because I know I'd like to have someone to share experiences with. I'd go mad on my own. And I sure would not miss junk  mail--- I hate coming home every evening and a pile of junk mail in my post box.\nPost 4\nMiko\nJapan Hi, I would miss Manga cartoon, the internet and Japanese food, like sushi. I'd also miss TV shows and shopping for clothes... In fact, I'd miss everything.\nPost 5\nRoger\nUK I would miss my daily newspaper and listening to the news on TV and radio. I'd feel very cut off if I didn't know what was happening in the world. What I'd miss least would be traffic jams in the city, particularly my journey to work.\nPast 6\nJayne Why hasn't anyone mentioned their family? I'd be lost without my husband and two kids. They're the most important for me. And I can't get started in the morning without a cup of black coffee. I wouldn't miss doing the housework!\nPost 7\nJaime\nMexico It would have to be music. I couldn't live without my music. I wouldn't miss going to school at all or doing homework!", "id": "high2020.txt"}
