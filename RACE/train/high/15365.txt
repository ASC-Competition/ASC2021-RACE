When the house is very noisy, Megan, one of the children, is quietly inventing. A year ago, the 10-year-old had to design an anti-smoking poster, she came up with the idea of creating something that shows the average amount of tar  a smoker collects from just four packs of cigarettes.\n\"I like people to play with things more than read and write,\" she says. So she researched her idea on the Internet, found a company in China that could make it, saved up her pocket money and got her idea made.\nPaula says her daughter \"think differently\": Ideas jump into her mind. After she got sunburnt on holiday, Megan invented a small plastic bracelet  that changes colors in the sun, telling you when to put on sunscreen . Several sunscreen companies have expressed an interest in the idea. She also came up with an idea to make a ball filled with water to stop the dog from feeling thirsty. \"But we didn't do anything with it,\" says Paula.\nThen she pulls out a picture of a special fishing rod  she had designed. \"There is a camera on the hook ,\" she explains, \"and the screen is on the handle, and it shows if you've caught a fish or not.\"\nMegan doesn't want to go to university. She keeps her pink-and -cream bedroom tidy. Paula is amazed and a bit confused by her daughter. \"Everything has to be in a certain order,\" Paula says. \"Her brothers and sisters go with the flow, but with Megan, it's 'What time will that be happening?' or 'Where am I being picked up from today?'\"", "id": "high15365.txt"}
