PenPals Program begin?\nThe program began as a way of reaching out to the children affected by the devastating   hurricanes of 2005. Our hope was that by matching young hurricane survivors with a new pen pal, we could help them in their recovery from the trauma   they experienced.\nThe program is now available to all children worldwide. We continue to welcome teachers, youth groups or agencies who like to work with hurricane survivors.\nHow does it work?\nAmazing Kids! will match students of the same gender and age with other students who may share similar interests and hobbies, based on the information provided on the registration form.\nI've completed all forms and made my payment. What happens next?\nSomeone from Amazing Kids! will contact you once a match has been found. You will be asked to call the other parent, teacher or group leader of the pen pal Amazing Kids! has selected. If both adults agree that the pen pal match is a good one, then the students may begin writing to each other. If the match is determined not to be a good one, Amazing Kids! will try and find an alternative match.", "id": "high7011.txt"}
