Many of passers-by slowed down their paces and put some money into the hat of the young man.\nThe next day, at the same place, he put his hat on the ground gracefully. Different than the day before, he took out a large piece of paper and laid it on the ground and put some stones on it. Then he adjusted the violin and began playing. It seemed more pleasant to listen to.\nThe words read, \"Last night, a gentleman named George Sang put an important thing into my hat mistakenly. Please come to claim it soon.\"\nSeeing this, people wondered what it could be. After about half an hour, a middle-aged man ran there hurriedly and rushed through the crowd to the violinist and grabbed his shoulders and said, \"Yes, it's you. You did come here. I knew that you're an honest man and would certainly come here.\"\n\"Are you Mr. George Sang\"? asked the young violinist.\nThe man nodded.   \"Did you lose something?\" \"Lottery. It's lottery.\" \"Is it?\" The violinist took out a lottery ticket and asked.\nGeorge nodded promptly and seized the lottery ticket and kissed it, then he danced with the violinist.\nThe story turned out to be this: George Sang bought a lottery ticket, winning a prize of $500,000. After work, he passed the station and felt the music was so wonderful that he took out 50 dollars and put it in the hat. However, the lottery ticket was also thrown in. The violinist was a student at an Arts College and had planned to attend further study in Vienna. He had booked the ticket and would fly that morning. However when he was cleaning up he found the lottery ticket. Thinking that the owner would return to look for it, he cancelled the flight and came back to where he was given the lottery ticket.\nWhen asked why he didn't take the lottery ticket for himself, the violinist said, \"Although I don't have much money, I live happily; but if I lose honesty I won't be happy forever.\"", "id": "high5419.txt"}
