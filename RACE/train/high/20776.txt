But, when I arrived in Paris, I came to know why France could remain the lead in world fashion and Paris could attract so many designers from all over the world to come.\n    On the boulevard of Champs-elysees, there are many fashion shops of famous brands, such as Chanel, Dior, Pierre Cardin. In daily life, however, most of Parisians never wear clothes like those on the super models. On the opposite, I found people in Paris often dress in very simple designs and usually in dark.\n    Such situation doesn't affect French designers to create more and more new styles. But I would say people in Paris dress more formally than those in the rest of France. In other French cities, what people wear are usually casual dresses, such as T-shirts and jeans.\n    French people act as the fashion leaders, but they accept other clothes styles as well. Montpellier, the city I live in, is in southern France near the Mediterranean Sea. Here are many immigrants  from Algeria, Morocco and other African countries. The Arabian and African cultures are influential  in this city. Therefore, you can find a lot of young people dress in the North African style.", "id": "high20776.txt"}
