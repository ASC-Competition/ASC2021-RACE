As they were walking along by its side a countryman passed them and said: \"You fools, what is a donkey for but to ride upon?\"\n    So the man put the boy on the donkey and they went on their way.  But soon they passed a group of men, one of whom said: \"See that lazy boy, he lets his father walk while he rides.\"\nSo the man ordered his boy to get off, and got on himself. But they hadn't gone far when they passed two women, one of whom said to the other: \"Isn't that lazy man ashamed of making his pool little son walk while he rides?\"\n    The man didn't know what to do. At last he took his boy up before him on the donkey. By this time they had come to the town, and the passers-by began to jeer and point at them. The man stopped and asked what they were laughing at. The men said: \"Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading that poor donkey with you and your son?\"\n    The man and boy got off and tried to think what to do. They thought again and again and then they cut down a pole, tied the donkey's feet to it, and raised the pole and the donkey to their shoulders.  They went along surrounded by the laughter of all who met them till they came to Market Bridge, when the donkey, getting one of his feet loose, kicked out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole.  In the struggle the donkey fell over the bridge, and his fore-feet  were tied together,so it was drowned.", "id": "high17985.txt"}
