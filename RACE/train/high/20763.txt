First, I want to tell you how proud we are. Getting into Columbia is a real testament   of what a great well-rounded student you are. You should be as proud of yourself as we are.\n    Your college years will be the most important of your life. It is in college that you will discover what learning is about. This will be the period when you go from teacher taught to master inspired, after which you must become a self-learner. So do take each subject seriously, and even if what you learn is of no practical use in real life, the learning skills you get will be something you will value forever.\nFollow your passion in college. Take courses you think you will enjoy, don't be bothered by what others think or say, but make up your own mind. Most importantly, make true friends and be happy. Don't worry about their hobbies, grades, looks, or even personalities.\nStart planning early what you'd like to do. Where would you like to live? What would you like to learn? I think your plan to study fashion is good, and you should decide where you want to be, and get onto the right courses. I will always be there for you, but the time has come for you to be in the driver's seat--this is your life, and you need to be in control. Being in control feels great. Try it, and you'll love it!\nSo please treasure your college years -- make the best use of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny, and learn through your successes and challenges.\nMay your years at Columbia be the happiest of your life, and may you grow into just what you dream to be.\nLove\nDad & Mom\n       (Excerpt from Kai-Fu Lee's letter to his daughter)", "id": "high20763.txt"}
