But the donator who started sending envelopes with cash to deserving causes,accompanied by an article from the local paper, has made a northern German city believe in fairytales  \nThe first envelope was sent to a victim support group. It contained EUR10,000 with a cutting from the Braunschtveiger Zeitung about how the group supported a woman who was robbed of her handbag; similar plain white anonymous  envelopes, each containing EUR10,000, then arrived at a kindergarten and a church.\nThe envelopes keep coming, and so far at least EUR190,000 has been distributed. Last month, one of them was sent to the newspaper's own office. It came after a story it published about Tom, a 14-year-old boy who was severely disabled in a swimming accident. The receptionist at the Braunschweiger Zeitung opened an anonymous white envelope to find 20 notes of EUR500 inside , with a copy of the article. The name of the family was underlined.\n\"I was driving when I heard the news,\" Claudia Neumann, the boy's mother, told DerSpiegel magazine. \"I had to park on the side of the road; I was speechless. \"\nThe money will be used to make the entrance to their house wheelchair-accessible .and for a course of treatment that their insurance company refused to pay for.\n\"For someone to act so selflessly, for this to happen in such a society in which everyone thinks of himself, was astonishing,\" Mrs. Neumann said. Her family wonder whether the donator is a Robin Hood character, taking from banks to give to the needy.\nHenning Noske, the editor of the Braunschweiger Zeitung, said: \"Maybe it is an old person who is about to die. We just do not know. \" However, he has told his reporters not to look for the city's hero, for fear that discovery may stop the donations.", "id": "high489.txt"}
