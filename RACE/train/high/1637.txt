Tourists from the United Kingdom make up the bulk   of visitors to Scotland. In 2002, for example, UK visitors made 18.5 million visits to Scotland, staying 64.5 million nights and spending PS3.7 bn.

There are also many historic castles, houses, and battlegrounds, ruins and museums. Many people are drawn by the culture of Scotland.\nThe cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow are increasingly being seen as a cosmopolitan alternative to Scotland's countryside, with visitors year round, but the main tourist season is generally from April to October inclusive. In addition to these factors, the national tourist agency, VisitScotland, have deployed a strategy of niche   marketing, aimed at exploiting, amongst other things, Scotland's strengths in golf, fishing and food and drink tourism.
