Then he heard the smoke alarm go off. He went downstairs quickly to investigate. When he opened the door to the basement  , flames exploded out.\nDonald fled   back upstairs to call 911 but the phone didn't work. When he tried to go downstairs, he was stopped by a wall of flames. He had to use a towel to cover his mouth. His house was three miles off the main road and so well hidden by trees that Donald knew calling for help would be useless. Actually, he didn't even try to do that.\nAbout one mile away lived Donald's closest neighbor, Jeremie. When he heard some sounds, Jeremie jumped out of bed, holding a phone and a flashlight, and went towards the noise. He dialed 911 the instant he saw the flames. When he came close to the house, Jeremie knew he'd better wait until rescuers came. But he didn't want Donald to die in the fire.\nWithout hesitation  , he rushed into the house. He shouted, \"Donald, where are you?\" Then he had to run outside to catch his breath. After one more attempt  , he gave up and circled around back. He saw Donald on the second-floor balcony, but there was no way to get to him. Suddenly, he noticed a ladder. He dragged it over to the balcony and pulled Donald down just when the second floor fell down.\nWithin the year, Donald built a new two-story wood house at the site of the fire. Jeremie and Donald don't run into each other regularly, but Donald knows that if he ever needs help, Jeremie will be there.", "id": "high8227.txt"}
