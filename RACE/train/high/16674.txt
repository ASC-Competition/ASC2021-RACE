Many vectors of disease such as mosquitoes, flies, and rodents, as well as the viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens are highly temperature and moisture sensitive. As temperature increases,  _ are likely to spread into new areas and may have potentially devastating effects on wildlife populations that have not been previously exposed. Reproduction, growth, and biting rates of insects all go up with increases of temperature. Winter is the limiting time for many pathogens, killing back populations each year. With milder winters, this population bottleneck may be removed for many species. Warmer, longer summers also mean that the period of time of disease transmission is longer. Warmer summers may increase host susceptibility to disease due to thermal stress, particularly in the oceans. Marine bacteria and fungal growth rates are positively correlated with increasing temperature.", "id": "high16674.txt"}
