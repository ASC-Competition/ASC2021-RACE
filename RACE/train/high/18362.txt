But if you wash down those doughnuts with at least seven cups of coffee a day, you are only half as likely as that. \nThe finding is \"quite surprising and fairly dramatic\", says Bill Hartnett of UK Diabetes, although the patients' group won't be advising people to drink lots of coffee just yet. While there's little evidence that one or two cups a day is harmful, some studies suggest that heavy coffee drinkers are unusually sensitive to pain, easier to fearful disorders and can also have higher blood pressure, which increase the risk of heart disease. \nThe study was done by Rob van Dam's team at the National Institute for Public Health and Environment in the prefix = st1 /Netherlands, which analysed the data on 171,111 men and women. The team found that those who drank seven or more cups of coffee a day were 50 percent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who drank two cups of coffee or fewer a day. This was despite the fact that the heavy coffee drinkers tended to have sedentary  lifestyles, which increases the risk of developing diabetes. \n\"It's too early to get excited,\" warns Edwin Gale, a diabetes specialist in Britainat theUniversityofBristol. \"It may just be that coffee drinkers behave differently,\" he says. \nType 2 diabetes used to appear mainly in older people, but as levels of obesity (being fat) have increased in children, so has the disease in common. It's a serious disorder--high blood sugar levels damage many organs, and can lead to anything from blindness to kidney  failure. \nIt usually occurs when the body becomes less sensitive to insulin , the hormone that tells cells to take in too much blood glucose. Caffeine isn't an obvious remedy   for type 2 diabetes, because its immediate effect is to lower sensitivity to insulin.", "id": "high18362.txt"}
