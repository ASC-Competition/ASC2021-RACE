Recently, developments in fourth-generation networks and associated communication devices such as smart phones and smart tablets such as the BlackBerry PlayBook have allowed social networking technology to take a giant leap forward.\nIn this fast-paced world it is often difficult to stay in contact with friends, family, and coworkers, due to the fact that work and education often cause people to move to a number of different locations after spending only a short time in each place. Many people have accepted the fact that family members may only see each other a few times a year. Smart phones are equipped with their own wireless fidelity   connections, which allow them to connect to Internet-based social networking sites. The BlackBerry PlayBook allows users to make hands-free telephone calls while on the go, and it has a host of other interesting functions. At the same time, PlayBook users can still surf the same old websites, and check e-mail through the Internet connection. However, instant messaging and e-mail are quickly becoming outdated because of the PlayBook's video chat capabilities.\nThis particular feature makes the PlayBook an excellent choice for those families who find themselves separated over long distances. Someone once said that a picture was worth a thousand words. Thanks to the PlayBook's video chat capabilities, users of 4G devices can gain a measure of the physical contact that all human beings hope for, because of the device's ability to deliver the streaming real-time video to their users. Therefore, people can see the person they are speaking to, and read their facial expressions as well as their body language, while also hearing their actual voices in stereo sound  .\nBased on this information, choosing to buy the BlackBerry PlayBook is one of the best choices that one can make. Use the benefits of this newest BlackBerry tablet to stay in touch with those closest to you. With the PlayBook, you will never be far from friends or family no matter where life's journeys might take you.", "id": "high23950.txt"}
