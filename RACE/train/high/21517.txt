Photographed every day for the past half a year by Manhattan artist Sally Davies, the kids meal of fries and burger shows no sign of mould  or decomposition . \n   In a work named The Happy Meal Project, Mrs. Davies, 54, tries to provide evidences that McDonald's food really is the worst you can put in your body.\n   Sitting on a shelf in her apartment, Sally has watched the Happy Meal with increasing shock and even her dogs have resisted the urge to try and steal a free tasty snack. \"I bought the meal on April 10 of this year and brought it home with the intention of leaving it out to see how it changed,\" she said. \"I chose McDonald's because it was nearest to my house. The first thing that struck me on day two of the experiment was that it no longer gave out any smell. And then the second point of note was that on the second day, my dogs stopped circling the shelf it was sitting on trying to see what was up there.\" \nExpecting the food to begin moulding after a few days, Mrs Davies' surprise turned to shock as the fries and burger still had not shown any signs of decomposition after two weeks. \"It was then that I realised that something strange might be going on with this food that I had bought,\" she explained. \"The overall appearance of the food did not change as the weeks turned to months. And now, at six months old, the food is plastic to the touch. The only change that I can see is that it has become hard as a rock.\" \n   As a strict vegetarian, Mrs. Davies' experiment has brought her amusement rather than fear. \"Maybe I would be frightened at seeing this if I was a meat eater. Why hasn't even the bread become with mould? It is strange.", "id": "high21517.txt"}
