Rabbits do not naturally eat root vegetables, such as carrots, nor do they naturally eat lettuce , the charity said.\nThe charity said that people were using these foodstuffs as major parts of a rabbit's diet, when in fact they can cause health problems. Just 8% of owners knew what to correctly feed their rabbits, according to statistics.\nThis might explain why 11% of rabbits are suffering from tooth decay and a further 11% from digestive problems, according to research at the University of Bristol, commissioned by the RSPCA.\n\"We want all pet rabbits to be eating hay as their main food,\" said Rachel Roxburgh, an animal scientist for the charity. \"People also think their rabbits should eat carrots because that's what Bugs Bunny does. But he's a cartoon, real rabbits don't talk, and they shouldn't be eating carrots too often either.\"\nThe RSPCA suggests giving rabbits daily handfuls of hay, around the same size as the rabbits themselves. They can also feed on grass, but not lawn clippings  .\nTo vary their diet and give them a treat, dark green vegetables are advised, including broccoli, kale and cabbage on a daily basis, as well as regular parts of commercial nuggets .\nWhat do you feed your rabbits? Are you guilty of giving them one too many carrots?", "id": "high8105.txt"}
