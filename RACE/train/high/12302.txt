On arriving at the beach, I saw JoJo, a wealthy man in hotel business. We sat down to chat in an open air cafe while I watched my daughter enjoy herself on the swings   in front of us.\nSuddenly, our conversation was interrupted by a stranger, who politely asked permission to speak to me privately. People often want to tell me something about my TV show.\nWe stood a bit away from my table. He said, \"I'm James, the father of a 7-year-old girl who's very sick. The doctors said that if she was treated in the UK, she would probably survive. But I'm poor, so can you help me, please?\"\nI stared into the man's eyes full of tears and asked how I could help. After I went back, JoJo asked me, \"What's wrong?\" I told him about it and he was very sorry for that family.\nAll day I thought about James's family. I even thought about making a special TV show to raise money for the sick child.\nOn Monday morning, JoJo walked into my office. Actually, JoJo was very busy, and I never imagined he would have the time to come and see me.\n\"Please, call the man and tell him I'll pay all the expenses for the girl's treatment,\" JoJo said with a cheque in his hand. \"I've been married for 35 years; I wasn't lucky enough to have a child. Sometimes I feel lonely. I want to help this child.\" I picked up the phone to call James.\nNow James's daughter is well and JoJo sometimes goes to visit her. I'm so happy that there are so good people on this earth.", "id": "high12302.txt"}
