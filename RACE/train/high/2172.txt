Improving the health of the populations,he says,has proven to be an essential method in helping poor countries to be financially successful.\"National borders allow inequalities,\"said Gates.\"We all need  to take a more global view,rather than just saying my country is doing well.We have to step up these health issues,knowing how few resources are going into them.\"\nGates said that both his parents set up an example for him as a child.His father,William H.Gates,was the head of the local Planned Parenthood,and his mother,Mary,volunteered for the United Way.As he gathered his fortune,Gates knew he would finally want to give back as well,but he didn't expect to devote himself wholeheartedly to one project until he was about 60.\nHowever,Gates,47,began to question his ability to wait that long.\"It seemed there was a real time urgency,\"Gates said.\"I started to think how many lives I could save before then.\"", "id": "high2172.txt"}
