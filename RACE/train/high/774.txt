Hazel Rymer frequently has to struggle through rainforests, climb to the top of mountains, then climb 200 metres into the crater of active volcanoes. But the 38-year-old volcanologist does her best to make it sound less alarming than it is. \"Driving to work is more risky,\" she insists. \"And the deepest I go into the crater of a volcano is about 300 metres,\" she adds, trying to make it all sound as ordinary as taking the dog for a walk.\nHazel has been studying volcanoes for a long time, so it's not surprising she is used to the danger. Her interest in volcanoes began at school. A teacher gave her a book about Pompeii. \"I remember reading about the eruption of Vesuvius and the destruction of the city,\" she explains. \"The thought of all those people just frozen in time had quite an effect on me and I am still excited by their dangerous beauty today.\"\nNowadays, volcanoes are getting more and more unpredictable. There have been many changes in sea level caused by global warming and melting ice caps. _ have resulted in some dormant volcanoes erupting, so studying them is more dangerous than ever before. Hazel says that although she doesn't take any unnecessary risk she has had some frightening moments. Her worst experience was on the slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily, when she was slowly surrounded by lava. \"I had a choice of walking ten hours to get around the lava flow or just walking across it,\" she explains. She chose to pick a path across the cooler rocks in the lava stream. \"I guess it was five metres. The flow was 1,000degC, so if you hesitated your boots would begin to melt. It was scary, but it really was a practical decision --- there wasn't time to do anything else.\"\nAnd what about the future? \"I haven't been to the volcanoes in Indonesia yet. And I would love to spend some time working in the Antarctic,\" she says. \"I would also like to know why quiet lava flows erupt from some volcanoes and why other volcanoes go bang.\" In other words, Hazel Rymer won't be exchanging her volcanoes for the relative safety of driving to work just yet.", "id": "high774.txt"}
