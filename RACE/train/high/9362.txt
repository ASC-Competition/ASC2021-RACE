Needing firewood, I quickly set out with my best friend, Bruce, to look for a tree to cut down. I was glad to have Bruce along. Cutting down a tree in a snowstorm can be dangerous. So it was important to have a friend who could warn me of dangers.\nWhen I chose a big 23-meter-tall tree and prepared to cut it down, my best friend suddenly warned me, \"Don't cut down that tree! It's too close to the power line!\" I wasn't sure about it. So I decided to _ his warning. I wanted to finish the job quickly and go home. So I began cutting down the tree. When the tree fell, there was no longer any doubt that my friend was right.\nThe tree caught the power line, bringing it to the ground. I considered cutting the tree off the line. After all, electricity can't travel through wood, so I could safely remove the tree. As I reached out my finger to touch the tree, pain ran up my arm and through my head. I had been shocked!\nAfter I returned home and told my mother what had happened, she quickly called the power company. Workers from the power company soon arrived on the scene. One of them asked if I had touched the tree, and when I told him I had, his face turned pale.\n\"You should have been killed,\" he said.\nSo why am I still alive? It was my boots that saved my life.\nWithin two hours, the workers removed the tree. Soon the snowstorm calmed down--but not my mother.\nEven though she was glad I wasn't hurt, my mother was well serious with me. After all, I shouldn't have brushed off my friend's warning.\nThrough this experience, I learned that it's important to listen to people who offer a different perspective . Taking the time to listen might actually save a lot of time and trouble. It certainly would have kept me from getting the \"shock of my life\".", "id": "high9362.txt"}
