Confucius was born in a noble family in the state of Lu. However,his parents were poor. His father died when Confucius was only three  years old. In 527 BC he began his life as a teacher,usually traveling about and teaching the followers that were around him. Confucius worked as an official of the state of Lu. However,he soon left office to travel and teach. In 484 BC he returned to Lu,where he lived until his death.\nLiving in the turbulent period,Confucius believed that people must go back to the principles of the ancient wise men. He therefore lectured to his pupils on the classics and taught them how to behave properly in society. Confucius did not write down the principles of his philosophy. The Analects (<<>> ),a work written by some of his followers,is considered the most faithful source of information about his life and teachings.\nThe teachings of Confucius were practical and moral,rather than religious. He said that man's behavior should be based on five virtues:kindness, uprightness ,decorum ,wisdom and faithfulness .He asked everyone to fulfill their duties carefully toward the state. In the centuries after his death,his teachings,known as Confucianism,had a more powerful influence on the Chinese nation.", "id": "high3847.txt"}
