There are many wrong ideas about autism. The kids I work with can think and feel. They need help only in certain areas.\nOf course, each kid is special. For example, some kids like to draw, and others like to sing.\nAt the school, the kids learn through about 20 activities. These activities can help them learn skills they will need later in life.\nThe very first day I volunteered, a boy came up to me, put his hand on my shoulder, and said \"Hello\". From then on, I knew I could make a difference.\nAnother boy loved to have me read books that can help him learn to read. Sometimes he could be encouraged to read a few words or sentences. Finally, one day during reading practice, he read nearly 220 words himself!\nSummer school is also a time for fun, Last summer, bagpipe players came to perform. Most of us had our hands over our ears because they were so loud. When they asked for a volunteer from the audience, one girl raised her hand as high as she could, got up on stage, and even tried the bagpipes in front of everyone.\nThrough these experiences, I realize that the challenges these kids face do not stop them from doing many amazing things. I'm teaching them, but they are teaching me more.", "id": "high4925.txt"}
