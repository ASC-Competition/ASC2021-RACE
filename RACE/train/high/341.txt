On Friday morning on my way to work, I suddenly remembered that I had spent the past six weeks without considering that I had a week's vacation planned during that time. I was very disappointed with myself for not remembering it.\nThe truth is that I was not paying enough attention to my driving and I did not come to a complete stop at the stop sign in front of a school. I was so distracted   that I didn't even notice I had a policeman on my tail with his lights flashing. Finally I looked in my mirror and caught on.\nThe policeman was rude and took my papers.
