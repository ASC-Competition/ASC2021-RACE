He has been particularly popular here in northern Zhejiang province, from which his grandmother went to Taiwan in the late 1940s. \nCai Qi, a well-known micro blogger, posted a message on micro blog over the weekend stating that Lin's hometown is Jiaxing, a city near Hangzhou where Lin's grandmother grew up. \nCai Qi's nephew Yu Guohua, a 56-year-old factory worker, is Lin's closest   still living in northern Zhejiang. He said in a telephone interview that Lin had come to play basketball with the Jiaxing High School team last May and had been surrounded by admirers. \nYu said he did not have a chance to meet Lin in the crowd, but managed to speak with his family. \"His father was very supportive of Lin's playing basketball, but his grandmother was not, for fear he would be injured,\" Yu said. \nLin may owe his height, 6 feet 3 inches, to his grandmother's family, Yu said. Chen Weiji, the father of Lin's grandmother, was well over 6 feet and all of Chen's children were tall as well, he said. \nThe N.B.A. believes that 300 million people in China play basketball. The retirement last year of Yao Ming took its main Asian draw away from the N.B.A. But Lin's appearance has helped the league remain a hot topic of Chinese online chatter.", "id": "high21022.txt"}
