The campaign is being supported by five times Olympic gold medalist, Sir Steve Redgrave, who has reading trouble.\nPupils have the right to receive text in another way, and parents can take action under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) if they feel their children are being treated in a different way through a lack of support. But new research suggests 89 per cent of print disabled pupils and their parents are unaware of software which changes standard print into other substitutes like combined text and audio files   which can be read or listened to.\nSir Steve has teamed up with software company Dolphin Computer Access to raise awareness of software turning tools. He said: \"I recognize that schools have competing priorities   for their resources  , but I would like to see a much greater effort on the part of the government and schools to raise awareness among parents that these additional solutions exist and that their children have a right to use them.\"\nMike Foster, Dolphin's local MP in Worcester, is _ the campaign. \"There is clearly an issue to solve concerning software for special needs. I'll be asking ministers what steps can be taken to improve the situation\", he said.", "id": "high3491.txt"}
