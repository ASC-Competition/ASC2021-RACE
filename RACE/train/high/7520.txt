Each as large as a football field, they may be openings into natural caves below the Martian surface.\n\"If there is life on Mars, there is a good chance you'd find it in caves,\" said Jut Wynne, one of the researchers who noticed the features while working on a US Geological Survey Mars Cave Detection Program.\nJonathan Clarke, a geologist with the Mars Society of Australia, yesterday described the discovery as exciting.\nOne photo taken at night by an infrared imager  showed one hole to be unusually warm, suggesting hot air trapped during the day is flowing out.\n\"I said: 'Wow, that's a cave'\" Dr. Clarke said excitedly. \"People have been looking for these for a long time; now we have found them.\"\nHe agreed such caves would be perfect places to hunt for life escaping from the bitterly cold, radiation-soaked , dry surface.\n\"Tiny drops of water could collect inside,\" he said. \"If there are gases coming out, they could provide energy for a whole range of bacteria. A cave is also a protection from radiation; the surface of Mars is exposed to high levels of space radiation.\"\nThe caves probably formed when tube-shaped lave flows  spread across the planet long ago. The outside of the tubes cooled, forming solid walls, while something hotter inside allowed the remaining have to flow out, forming caves.", "id": "high7520.txt"}
