My husband and I are very emotional and have loads of dreams in life. Now I want to share a hidden part of my life.\nAfter one month of my marriage, I started working because I could not sit home. To accomplish our dreams, we are both working hard day and night in spite of belonging to a good family. Life is very strange. When any turn happens, one cannot know.\nI started working because I was very ambitious. I used to wonder about people who worked to earn their bread but I never knew in my wildest dreams that I would be part of the crowd who work to earn a livelihood.\nI was blessed with a daughter in November, 2009. She was just three months and 15 days old when I rejoined my job. My husband supported me and my family supported me but I never wanted to work again because I belonged to a family where a mother should give her full attention to her child.\nKeeping all the values aside that I learnt from my parents, I went back to work and will work till my last breath.\n         I missed my daughter every second. She has started recognizing and throwing expressions for likes and dislikes. I cannot share my feelings with anyone, as I do not want anyone to know that I am broken completely from inside.\nMy husband and my daughter are my greatest strength but I ignore them just to earn money and fulfill my dreams that I have.\nIf one day, my daughter complains to someone about her mom, please tell her that she is my reason for survival and happiness and she is the only one who brings smile to my face.", "id": "high22601.txt"}
