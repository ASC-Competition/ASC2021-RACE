The survey was asked to carried out by Pencourage, a new anonymous \"diary-style\" social media website.\nResearchers found that at least one in four women exaggerated or twisted what they are doing on social media once a month.

They also said that the more we try to make our lives seem perfect, the less perfect we feel.

Almost one in five women even lied about their \"relationship status\".\n\"We work very hard presenting ourselves to the world online, pretending and attempting to be happy all the time which is exhausting and ultimately unfulfilling,\" said Dr Michael Sinclair, a leading British consultant psychologist. \"Leaving out the less desirable imperfections of our lives from the conversations with our 'friends online leads to less opportunity to feel empathized with, resulting in a greater sense of disconnection from others. \"", "id": "high4242.txt"}
