Isn't it often the same in schools of our real world? A great many boys fall behind their female classmates.\n\"It's surprising but true that most of the top students have been girls since primary school. Girls are class leaders, club presidents and the top ones in exams,\" said Wang Feixuan, 15, who studies at a Chengdu school. By any measure, Wang herself is a high-achiever. She is a top student, a team leader in her school's sports club and a winner in national English and IT competitions.\nBut why do so many girls _ their male peers ?\nIn Sun Yunxiao's latest book Save Our Boys, he points out that the education system is \"more suited to girls, who are good at memorizing and like to sit quietly and read.\" Yet he also says that girls have to do so much more when they compete with males for honors, top universities and later good jobs.

On the TV, on the Internet, and everywhere, girls see images of impossible perfection .\nToday's young women must be good learners, good athletes, and fill their after-school lives with other activities. But they're also asked to have the styles and looks of popular stars. \"Be pretty, sweet and nice. Be athletic, competitive and get straight. Be impossibly perfect.\" Stephen Hinshaw sums up.", "id": "high6438.txt"}
