And now new research shows parents are turning to their children for lessons in technology.\nThe new study of around 1,000 parents showed that 67% of parents have asked their teenager children for technology-related advice. 44% have asked their teenager for help using the Internet, and 41% have received teen advice about how to use the TV or home entertainment system.\nAhad Surooprajally, a father of five children, says his children help him with technology in the home. \"They've grown up surrounded by technology,\" he explains. \"We have four computers and four iPads in our house. If I want to know something technical they're the ones I go to.\"\nHe says his nine-year-old son Habeeb is the only person in the house who really understands the TV. So he tells Habeeb which film he wants to watch and Habeeb connects his mobile phone to the TV. \"You teach your kids everyday life lessons, but the tables are turned when it comes to technology,\" says Ahad.\nAs well as learning how to use technology properly, there is another advantage of parents asking their children to help them understand the  digital world. They may be able to get a better understanding of what their kids are doing online.\nWill Gardner of the charity Childnet International says, \"We have to continuously encourage parents to find out more about what their children are doing online. If the kids are using a social networking site, get them to show you around it if you are not using it already.\"", "id": "high12682.txt"}
