Its goal is to help protect the planet's bio-diversity during a time of climate change.\nThe wild banana seed is under threat of extinction  in southwest China from agricultural development. It is a vital food source for Asian elephants and important for growing bananas for human eating.\nStored at minus-20 degrees centigrade, so they can last for thousands of years, the seeds await the day that scientists hope never comes--when the species no longer exist in the wild.\nIt is a race against time, Smith said, because in the last ten years alone, 20 plants held in the bank have already been wiped out in the wild. He estimates that between a third and a quarter will become extinct this century.\n\"It is pressing and it is happening now. An area, the size of England, is cleared of primary vegetation every year.\" Smith said.\nBecause most of the world's food and medicines come from nature, protecting wild plant species is quite important, scientists say. There are already many other seed banks safeguarding food crops, which only account for 0.6 percent of plant diversity.\nFor Kew's next goal--to collect a quarter of wild varieties by 2020--the botanists need 10 million pounds a year, or a further 100 million pounds on top of the 40 million they have already been granted.", "id": "high2735.txt"}
