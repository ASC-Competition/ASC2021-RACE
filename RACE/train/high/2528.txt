When I was growing up in the 1960s, it seemed that people - mostly relatives, but also friends - were always _ . My parents would put coffee on,and my mom would find something in the kitchen to serve along with it.Then the conversation would begin...The neighbor lady,a worrier,was unloading her sadness while my mom quietly listened.The Irish man next door had such an accent that I remember asking what language he spoke.My Polish relatives arrived in packs...But I never heard my parents say anything like \"We weren't expecting you'' or \"This isn't a good time.\"Drop-in visitors had a certain right of way and became No.1.\nWhat happened to such visits? Actually I know the answer.Times have changed.Everybody gets busy with work.There is no longer a stay-at-home mom keeping a pot of hot coffee or tea ready throughout the day for a surprise guest.Exploding malls and stores are now replacing homes as a central form of entertainment.\nJust the other day a former student of mine showed up.\"I'm sorry for the surprise visit.\"my student began.\"I just wanted to see if you still lived here.I'll only stay a minute.\"My response was immediate.\" No, you won't,\" I said.\"Just come in, sit, have coffee, and we'll talk.''\nI had nothing in the kitchen but we ordered pizza.And we had a lovely time.I have tried to keep the drop-in tradition alive though it takes some effort.", "id": "high2528.txt"}
