In fact, I firmly believe \"If it's yellow, let it mellow; if it's brown, flush it down.\"\nI'm sure a lot of it has to do with the fact that I work at home. Alone (well, except for the cats and dog). All day. And I drink a lot of water, which makes for many trips to the bathroom.\nAnother thing I have to admit: I also try to use very little toilet paper. I wash my hands after, though. Every time. (So maybe the water I don't use flushing makes up for the water used to wash my hands?)\nIronically, my husband, who only uses toilet paper when necessary, always flushes. But he doesn't seem to mind that I don't flush every time. Or, at least not enough to file for divorce. Yet.\nPosted by Juliet Farmer\nJun 14, 2010 at 10:21 PM\n _ \nWhen I'm at home alone I do not flush every time I pee .  My husband hates that, though, so when he's home, I flush a little more often.  I grew up doing that because I had a family that lived with huge tanks and you have to do it that way because it's easier on the system, so it doesn't bother me.  I do flush when I'm out in public, at people's houses that don't have big tanks and when we have company!\nCherBearCM, Jun 15, 2010 at 4:21 PM\nNot always. But I have 4 children who are always hanging from the door knob  while I pee anyway. So I'm lucky I have time to wash my hands after. The average toilet uses 8 gallons of water per flush! Much less than what it takes to wash my hands after. (just saying)\nluvbnmomnwife, Jun 15, 2010 at 4:32 PM", "id": "high11909.txt"}
