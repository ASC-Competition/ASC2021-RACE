Worse, have you ever given a present and watched your friend look as though she had opened the wrong box? Maybe she responded with a polite \"Why, thank you,\" but you knew _ . Why do presents sometimes go wrong? And what do your choices (good and bad) reflect about your personal qualities?\nChoosing the right gift is an art, I believe. It calls for empathy -- the ability to put yourself into someone else's head and heart. We're all able to do this; in fact, we're born with a kind of natural empathy. After the earliest period of childhood, however, it needs to be reinforced   -- by our parents, teachers, friends. When it isn't, we're not able to understand other people's feelings as sharply. This can show in the gifts we select, and so can many other emotional   qualities.\nThink back to the presents you've given over the past year, the time and effort you put into your selection, how much you spent, your thoughts while you were shopping, and your feelings when the receiver opened the package. Keep in mind that what you choose displays your inner world. (Of course, you may express yourself differently with different friends, relatives, and other people you know.)\nWe live in a society where exchanging presents is an important part of communication. Ignoring the tradition won't make it go away. If you really dislike such a tradition, tell your friends ahead of time.", "id": "high14994.txt"}
