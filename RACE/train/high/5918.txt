People who are prevented from sleeping begin to suffer obvious effects after a few days--they think less clearly, and they fall asleep during the working hours; some may have hallucinations .\nThere are no rules about sleep. Generally speaking, grown-ups sleep about 7 and a half hours each night and probably more than 60 per cent get between seven and eight hours. But perhaps eight per cent are quite happy with 5 hours or less, and four per cent or so find that they want ten hours or more. If you feel all right, you're probably getting enough sleep.
