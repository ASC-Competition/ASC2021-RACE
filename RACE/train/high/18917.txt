But what they don't know is that actual communication using mouth accounts for only around 10% (or even less) of all the means to communicate a message.\nMoreover, you can never determine the honesty of people by what they say alone. In fact, words expressed through mouth do not reflect what people really think or feel. The only way you can determine their true inner feelings and thoughts is by reading their body language.\nHave you ever wondered what it would be like if you can \"see through\" the emotions of other people? For example, you ask a person if he can do an important task. He says \"OK\". But deep inside, you are questioning yourself, \"Is he really willing to do this job?\" or \"Does he have the confidence to finish this task?\" You can't question him directly because that would be like belittling him. And even if you ask him those questions, his replies will not tell you what he really feels or thinks.\nThen what is the final solution? Here are just a few of the magic tricks you're about to discover:\n*Actions to make someone like or trust you.\n*How to win in a negotiation .\n*How to attract the opposite sex using body language.\n*How to increase your sales using body language.\n*How to help you find out who is telling a lie.\nAnd a lot, lot more!\nBody language is very easy and fun to learn. With this book, you will make body movements to achieve the success you've always longed for. Do yourself a big favor and get a copy of Body Language Magic.", "id": "high18917.txt"}
