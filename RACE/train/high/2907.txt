In my opinion, the most effective way is to learn lessons by heart. If you can recite the text and write it out, you've learned it fairly well. And if you can tell, in your own words, what the lesson says you're a very successful learner indeed. Your English will be quite perfect.This is a difficult task. However, if you try to learn by heart only part of each lesson, you'll find it not half so hard as you might have thought. Learning this way, you will make rapid progress. Of course, writing is also necessary. It helps you a lot on our way to success in English. Equally important is to feel the language. You should be able to laugh at jokes and be shocked at bad news. When using English, try to forget your mother tongue. Instead of helping you, your own language gets in your way. So, never try to see English through translation.", "id": "high2907.txt"}
