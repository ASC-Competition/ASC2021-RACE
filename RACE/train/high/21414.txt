We'd been preparing hundreds of berries, arranged gift baskets and packaged orders to be shipped around the country.\nBy the end of the day and I were exhausted. Shari didn't seem tired. That was what  Shari liked doing especially when she gave someone else something. I'd seen her give away berries to everybody--parking attendants, mail carriers, hairdressers. \"For me?\" they'd say, breaking into a smile.\nAs a \"thank you\", Shari took us out for dinner. But there was a 45-munite wait at her favorite restaurant. \"No big deal. There's another place just up the road,\" she said, driving us there. This time we walked right in. While the waitress took our drink orders Shari reached into her handbag, pulling something out. \n\"I want you to have these,\" she said, handing the waitress a box of chocolate-dipped strawberries. \n\"Will she love those berries!\"I said to myself. But the waitress seemed extremely surprised. She hardly let out a \"Thank you\" before grabbing the box and rushing into the kitchen.\nA few minutes later, the waitress returned with our iced tea. \" I apologize,\" she said. \" It's just ...my best friend and I made an agreement to send each other something every Valentine's Day. But she passed last year. I didn't know how I'd get through this day without her. Then you handed me that box.\"\n\"I'm so sorry to hear that,\" said Shari. \" It's not much, but I hope you can enjoy them.\"\n\"Oh, I will,\" the waitress said. \" See, every year we always sent each other the same thing: a box of chocolate-dipped strawberries bought from our favorite store, The Berry Factory.\"", "id": "high21414.txt"}
