But the flood that my friend was afraid of was a flood not of water, but of people. I expect you have heard of my friend: he writes books about his travels,and about the wild and wonderful animals that he collects. The money from the books helps to pay for all the food that these animals eat.\nMy friend told me that when he was out looking for water last week,(there is not enough water on the island,though there is plenty all round it,)he found oil.He needs money for his travels,and for his zoo,and a little oil would  buy enough water for a lifetime;but he knows that if he tells anybody else about it,it will be the end of his zoo, and his life's work.\nSo,if I know my friend,he will not tell anybody (but you and me)about what he found--because oil and water do not mix.", "id": "high7281.txt"}
