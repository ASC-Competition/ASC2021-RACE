But he went to London anyhow.\nGandhi believed in fighting without weapons or force. He called his method non-violence . He would simply disobey any unfair law or policy.

It would show how strongly the people felt about his beliefs.\nGandhi wanted all Indians to understand the independence movement. He walked barefoot through the villages, speaking to all people. Many people loved and understood Gandhi. His movement grew. The British flag came down in 1947.\nThe Indian people honored Gandhi with the title Mahatma, which means \"Great soul\".
