Posting too much personal information for those millions of cyber eyes to see can cause some big problems and can even invite a threat to your life.\nAs Mary learned, not everyone on the Internet is who he or she says they are. Adults will sometimes pose as other teens, posting fake photos and nice messages to gain trust. They use their fake identity to access the personal information of others, such as home address, phone number, or school name.\n\"That's not the most common scenario \", says David Finkelhor, a sociology professor at the University of New Hampshire. \"Only 3 percent of teens aged 10 to 18 who use the Internet report being asked to meet offline. But the danger is real.\nSafety measures\nMary's My Space profile is set to \"private\", which means that only the people she adds under the \"friend\" category can access her page. She also doesn't have any pictures of herself on her site. The only self-identifying material she has posted is her name, grade, and a list of hobbies.\n\"People can only add me if they know my last name or my e-mail, \"Mary says. \" I don't want random people to see my profile. I just go online to talk to my friends.\"\nStay safe and have fun online\nExperts say almost 90 percent of U.S. teens are online. But not everyone knows how to surf the Web in a smart way. With these tips, you can have fun, stay safe, and avoid embarrassment!\nPick a safe password. Make sure your password is something that other people won't be able to guess. Use numbers in between letters. \"spar123ky\" is better than \"sparky 123.\"\nPick a safe username. Make sure yours doesn't say too much about you, \"Happygirl13\" is better than \"AliceWaters13.\" Don't include your name, age, or where you are from. Never tell a stranger your name, school, address, age, birthday, phone number, or friends' names.", "id": "high20334.txt"}
