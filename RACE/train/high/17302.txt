Your reading environment can have a great effect on your understanding, so give some thought to how you can create or choose the right reading environments. The right environment allows you to stay alert and to keep all of your attention on the text, especially when it is both interesting and difficult.\nWhen you're at home, you can usually create effective conditions for reading. You might want to choose a particular place-a desk or table, for example-where you always read. Make sure the place you choose is well lighted, and sit in a chair that requires you to sit straight. Reading in a chair that's too soft and comfortable is likely to make you sleepy! Keep your active reading tools (pens, markers, notebooks or paper) and a dictionary close at hand.\nBefore you sit down for a reading period, try to reduce all possible interruptions. Turn off your phone, the television, and the radio. Tell your family members or roommates that you'll be busy for a while. If necessary, put a \"Do not disturb\" sign on your door! The more interruptions you must deal with while you read, the harder it will be to keep your attention on the task at hand.", "id": "high17302.txt"}
