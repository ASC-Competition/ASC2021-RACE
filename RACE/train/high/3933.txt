An application is calling on the next government to bring it back.\nAt school the children are taught to add up and subtract  but, extraordinarily, are not routinely shown how to open a bank account -- let alone how to manage their finances in an increasingly complex and demanding world.\nToday the parenting website Mumsnet and the consumer campaigner Martin Lewis have joined forces to launch an online application to make financial education a compulsory element of the school curriculum in England. Children from five to 16 should be taught about everything from pocket money to pensions, they say. And that was exactly the plan preserved in the Children, Schools and Families bill that was shelved by the government in the so-called \"wash-up\" earlier this month -- the rush to legislation before parliament was dismissed. Consumer and parent groups believe financial education has always been one of the most frustrating omissions of the curriculum.\nAs the Personal Finance Education Group (Pfeg) points out, the good habits of young children do not last long. Over 75% of seven- to 11-year-olds are savers but by the time they get to 17, over half of them are in debt to family and friends. By this age, 26% see a credit card or overdraft  as a way of extending their spending power. Pfeg predicts that these young people will \"find it much harder to avoid the serious unexpected dangers that have befallen many of their parents' generation unless they receive good quality financial education while at school.\"\nThe UK has been in the worst financial recession for generations. It does seem odd that -- unless parents step in -- young people are left in the dark until they are cruelly introduced to the world of debt when they turn up at university. In a recent poll of over 8,000 people, 97% supported financial education in schools, while 3% said it was a job for parents.", "id": "high3933.txt"}
