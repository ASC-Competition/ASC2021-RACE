Perhaps alcoholism and drug addiction really are \"diseases. \" as many people say, but my own feeling-based, of course, not on any serious study-is that most alcoholies and drug addicts belong to the \"undeserving poor. \" And that is largely why I don't give spare change to beggars.\nBut surely among the street people there are also some who can rightly be called \"deserving.\" Deserving what? My spare change? Or simply the government's assistance? It happens that I have been brought up to believe that it is proper to make contributions to charity , but if I give some change to a beggar, am I making a contribution to charity and thereby helping someone, or, am I perhaps simply encouraging someone not to get help? Or, maybe even worse, am I supporting a cheat?\nIf one believes in the value of private charity, one can either give to needy people or to charitable organizations. In giving to a beggar one may indeed be helping a person who badly needs help, but one cannot be certain that one is giving to a needy person. In giving to an organization, on the other hand, one can feel that one's money is likely to beused wisely. True, facing a beggar one may feel thatthis particular unfortunateperson needs help atthis moment-a cup of coffee or a sandwich-and the need will not be met unless I put my hand in my pocket right now. But I have come to think that the beggars whom I meet can get along without my spare change, and indeed perhaps they are actually better off for not having money to buy alcohol or drugs.\nI know nothing about these beggars, but it's my impression that they simply prefer begging to working. I am not generalizing about street people. I am talking about the people whom I actually meet. That's why I do not give \"spare change, \" and I don't think I will in the future.", "id": "high21559.txt"}
