To me, a customer is a person whose memory fails entirely once he or she starts to push a shopping cart. One of the first things customers forget is how to count. There is no other way to explain how so many people get in their express line, which is clearly marked 15 items  or less, with 20, 25 or even a cart load of items.\nCustomers also forget why they came to the store in the first place. Just as I finish ringing up an order, a customer will say, \"Oops, I forgot to pick up a fresh loaf of bread. I hope you don't mind waiting, while I go to get it.\"Five minutes later, he's back with the bread, a bottle of milk, and three rolls of paper towels. What is strange is that customers also seem to forget that they have to pay for their groceries. Instead of writing a check or looking for a credit card while I am ringing up the groceries, a customer will wait until I announce the total. Then, in surprise, she says, \" Oh no, what did I do with my check book?\" After 5 minutes of digging through her purse, she borrows my pen because she has forgotten hers. But I have to tolerate customers because they pay my salary, and that's something I can't afford to forget.", "id": "high11192.txt"}
