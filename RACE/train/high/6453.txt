''Having two languages gives you two windows on the world and makes the brain more flexible,\"he said.\"You are actually going beyond language and have a better understanding of different ideas.\"\nThe findings were matched in a study of native Italian speakers who had learned English as a second language between the ages of 2 and 34. Reading,writing,and comprehension were all tested.The results showed,that the younger they started to learn,the better.\"Studying a language means you get an entrance to another world,''explained the scientists.", "id": "high6453.txt"}
