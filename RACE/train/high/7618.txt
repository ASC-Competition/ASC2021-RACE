Youth culture celebrates too many bad examples, the reports say, and the finger of blame is often pointed at celebrities   who drink or take drugs, or who are seen as sexually casual. Yet according to parents and educationalists the media itself is partly to blame. They argue that television, newspapers and magazines are obsessed   with celebrity lives and over-promote a \"celebrity culture\" in which reality show stars are respected purely because they are on television.\nMeanwhile child psychologists warn of the negative effects of unsuitable role models, claiming that young people are being brainwashed into wanting to become famous overnight. They are taught to value physical appearance over personal achievement and set themselves impossible goals. According to a 2010 Home Office study, too many girls think that they have to look \"sexy\" and \"hot\" like their idols , and when they can't achieve this, they lose self-esteem   or suffer from depression and eating disorders.\nBut perhaps young people today are not as easily influenced as we think. The Girls' Attitudes Survey by Girlguiding UK (2011), for example, showed that young girls aged 11 to 21 questioned the media's description of women. Over half of the respondents disagreed with the statement that \"girls and young women are portrayed fairly in the media\".\nA Scout Association survey, of over a thousand 13- to 18-year-olds, showed that teenagers see their parents and siblings   as far more positive role models than celebrities, and while many youngsters list celebrities like Kate Moss and Katie Price as role models, others list high achievers like David Beckham, Paralympian swimmer Eleanor Simmons, and grandparents who fought in the Second World War.", "id": "high7618.txt"}
