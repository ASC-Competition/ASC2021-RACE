She is one of 26 bloggers for SPARK, an international group founded in 2010. The group fights the use of the female body as a marketing tool in the media.\nAlice found out about SPARK when the organization launched a campaign demanding Seventeen Magazine feature a more diverse group of models. She applied to be a blogger for the group in May and won one of the positions.\nEach month, Alice pitches (...) her girl -and women - centric blog post ideas via online chat to an editor at SPARK. So far, she has written about topics such as female actresses, choosing what to wear, and dealing with anger.\nAlice said she hopes large companies and media stop editing images of women. Increases in bust   size, decreases in waist size, smoothing and whitewashing skin are what Alice notes. \"We want them to know that these images are bad for our development,\" Alice said. \"Three out of four teen girls feel bad about themselves after reading a fashion magazine for three minutes,\" she said, according to SPARK's research.\nAlice first felt it necessary to advocate   for women in the fifth grade, after seeing a girl's T-shirt with writing on the front that read: \"Who needs brains when you have these?\"\n\"I was raised with this idea that if you don't like something, you can change it,\" Alice said. So Alice started following feminist bloggers. \nAlice juggles class work with blogging and creating videos and serves as editor-in-chief of her school's newspaper. It is amazing that she can handle everything well at the same time.\nShe's also focused on creating projects that aim to inspire girls - like designing a \"girl power bathroom\" at her school. The newly designed third-floor restroom is completed with pastel paint color1s and inspirational   quotes from women around the world.\n\"Sisterhood is powerful,\" Alice said. \"It can make you feel less alone.\"", "id": "high23929.txt"}
