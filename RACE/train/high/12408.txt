When the technology becomes commercially available, it could help lead-footed drivers avoid tickets and also save lives. The company that developed the product hopes to convince Australian government agencies to put the technology into use in their automobile fleets.\nThe product, called Speed Alert, links real-time location data and speed obtained with the help of GPS to a database of posted speed limits stored in a driver's PDA or programmable mobile phone. The setup of the product does not need to be hooked up to a car's speedometer. In fact, it is entirely portable. It will also work with newer phones and PDAs that have built-in GPS receivers. If a driver exceeds the speed limit, the speed is shown and an alert sounds.\nMichael Paine, an Australian vehicle design engineer and traffic safety consultant, was hired to analyze the product. He told Live Science that his colleagues in the road safety field are \"very enthusiastic\" about what they're now calling \"intelligent speed alert.\" Other research, according to Paine, shows that 40 percent of all traffic deaths involve speeding. There is also a potentially controversial future use: \"Since the system is so portable, it would be easy to make it a requirement for teenage drivers to always use a speed alert device when driving,\" Paine said. \"The system even has the capability to record speeding violations, so parents can monitor their teenage drivers.\"\nThe product will soon go on sale in Sydney.", "id": "high12408.txt"}
