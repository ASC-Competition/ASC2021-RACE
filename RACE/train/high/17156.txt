Many in agriculture believe such genetic copies are the next logical step in improving the nation's livestock  .\nMany Americans are likely to be against the idea of serving clones' milk to their children or putting meat from the offspring of clones into the kitchens. When they were asked earlier this year in a survey by the International Food Information Council whether they would willingly buy meat, milk and eggs that come from clones if the FDA declared them to be safe, 63 percent of consumers said no.\nYet scientific evidence suggests there is little cause for alarm, at least on food-safety grounds. Studies have shown that meat and milk from clones are not different from that from normal animals, although work is not complete and researchers say that clones do suffer slight genetic abnormalities  .\nWhile milk from clones might reach the shelves,  _ They'd be used as breeding stock , so the real question is whether their produced offspring would be safe.\nThe FDA has been promising a policy for three years, but hasn't produced a final view, and some biotechnology companies involved in cloning have run out of cash while waiting. Livestock producers have called the FDA the\"Foot Dragging Administration\".", "id": "high17156.txt"}
