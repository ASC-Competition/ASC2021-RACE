And it was reported that Erickson had never received any life-saving instruction before.\n\"I wasn't sure I could do it,\" Erickson said. \"I didn't know if I could swim through the river by myself, not to mention getting another person out with me.\"\nThis incident should be a lesson to young children who do not know how to swim.
