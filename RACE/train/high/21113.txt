Now, a study has found that\nwhile this is certainly true, men also have to deal with the fact that they are also more stupid than the fairer sex.\n    In the study, scientists measured the IQ of 2500 brothers and sisters and they found an\nuneven number of men not only in the top two percent, but also in the bottom two percent. The\nstudy's participants were tested on science, maths, English and mechanical abilities.\n    Though there were twice as many men as women in the smartest group, there were also\ntwice as many men among the foolish.\n      The total scores of men and women were similar.\n    One of the study's authors, psychology professor Timothy Bates, said that the phenomenon\nmay be because men have always been expected to be high achievers and women have been\nrestricted to spend more time taking care of their home.\n    \"The female developmental program may be tilted more towards ensuring survival\nand the safety of the middle ground.\"the Daily Mail quoted Professor Bates, of Edinburgh\nUniversity, as saying.\n    The research agrees with past results that men were more likely than women to receive first\nclass University degrees or thirds and women secured the seconds.\n    It has been said that men are more ready to take a risk when it comes to academics.\nWhile women have always been found to be steadier in their learning.\n    A past study has shown that women are securing more firsts and seconds, while men are\ncontinuing to receive more thirds.\n    The argument for the change is that the increase of coursework at the cost of exams favors\nwomen's steady approach.", "id": "high21113.txt"}
