My parents would never agree. The walls were old and some stones were missing and others loose and falling. However, my idea grew so strong. Then, I had all my courage to enter the living room, where all the adults had gathered.\n\"I... I want to climb the stone walls,\" I said. At once voices of disagreement went up from the women in the room. \"Heavens! No! You'll hurt yourself!\" I wasn't too disappointed because the result was just as I'd expected. But before I could leave the room, I was stopped by my grandfather's loud voice. \"Hold on just a minute.\" I heard him say. \"Let the boy climb the stone walls. He has to learn to do things for himself.\"\n\"Go,\" he said to me, \"and come to see me when you get back.\" For the next two and a half hours I climbed those walls, and had a good time of my life. Later I met with my grandfather to tell him about my adventures. I'll never forget what he said. \"Fred,\" he said, smiling. \"You made this day a special day just by being yourself. Always remember, there's only one person in this whole world like you, and I like you exactly as you are.\"\nMany years have passed since then, and today I host the television program, which is being seen by millions of children throughout USA. There have been changes over the years, but what my grandfather said never left me.", "id": "high21338.txt"}
