Finally, after months of study, you have some time to yourself. So, why not read a book? Well, some people will say, \"Why bother with books? We have the Internet and other media that offer a lot of more colorful entertainment. Books are history!\" But don't be fooled. I'm sure there's still a lot to be said for reading.\nOne clear reason is that a well-chosen book is a wonderful source of vocabulary, so long as you have a good dictionary, of course. Believe me, it's far easier to get new English words and phrases from a book or an article than it is from the TV or the Internet.\nBut another more important point is that books give you something that modern media simply can not. The average webpage is picture-heavy and the text is often designed to make it as easy to read as possible. While \"easy\" may be attractive, unfortunately it's of little use for any long-term development of reading skills and the general language level. Because of that, there's still no substitute   of a book.\nBut perhaps the best single reason is that simply choosing what you read and doing it independently means that it's something you do by and for yourself. You can choose what you want to read. It's hard work, but somewhere down the line, you'll find that what once seemed like a duty is now a pleasure.", "id": "high16038.txt"}
