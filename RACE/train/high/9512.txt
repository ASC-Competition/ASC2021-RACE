Ms. Deng, who works in a foreign enterprise in Beijing, has been walking to her office for more than six months now. \" I usually have a tight work schedule and can't find time to do exercise. So I choose to walk to work. \" As she said, if the office is not far from home, most women would like to go to work on foot. Walking is good for their health and can help them to keep good figures as well.\nApart from walking to office,one can also find time to do exercise when one is at work.
