He explained that he wished to buy a pearl for his wife' s birthday. The price didn't matter, since business had been very good for him that year. After examining a nice black one that costs $5, 000, he paid for the pearl in cash, shook hands with the jeweler, and left.\nA few days later the man returned and said that his wife liked the pearl so much that she wanted another one just like it. It had to be exactly the same size and quality as she wanted a pair of earrings made. \"Can you give me any advice on how to get such a pearl?\" said the man. The jeweler regretfully replied, \"I would say it's exactly impossible to find one exactly like that pearl.\"\nThe rich man insisted that the jeweler advertise in the newspapers, offering $25,000 for the matching pearl. Many people answered the advertisement but nobody had a pearl that was just right.\nJust when the jeweler had given up hope, a little old lady came into his store. To his great surprise, she pulled the perfect pearl from her purse.\" I don't like to part with it.\" she said sadly, I got it from my mother, and ,my mother got it from hers. But I really need the money.\nThe jeweler was quickly to pay her before she changed her mind .Then he called the rich man's hotel to tell him the good news .The man, however, was nowhere to be found.", "id": "high2539.txt"}
