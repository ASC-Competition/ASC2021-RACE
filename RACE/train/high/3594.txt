She was a key player on China's 1984 Olympic gold medal winning team.\nWhen the US team arrived for the Olympics, Lang, 48, who is from Beijing, had to take a different route to avoid a crowd of reporters and fans.\nThen came the greatest moment to Lang:while the US team was playing in a packed gym, at least 8,000 Chinese fans _ an American flag.\n\"That really says it all,\" Davis said. \"They look at her as an icon .I'm sure it's hard for them to see her coaching another country, but they love her so deeply that her success is their success.\"\nThe loyalty of the Chinese fans was tested on Friday, when China lost a match to the US.\n\"It's a pity that China lost the match, but I'm still glad that Lang Ping's team won, since she is the pride of China's volleyball,\" said Liu Chengli, a spectator. \"We also cheered for Lang's victory.\"\nLang said she just tried to stay professional when the two teams meet. \"It doesn't matter if we play China or any other team. It's the same.\" Lang said.\nDavis said she and her teammates could not have imagined the passion for volleyball among Chinese because the sport was lack of popularity in the US. The reception from Chinese fans has touched the US players, said a US volleyball player Lindsey Berg.\n\"It's such an honor to be here and play for our coach here in China,\" she said. \"The amount of support that the Chinese give to her and us has been tremendous. The whole event has been unbelievable.\"", "id": "high3594.txt"}
