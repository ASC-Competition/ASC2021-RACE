During the cold winter days, many people will complain the cold winter makes them catch a cold, and what they feel upset are not only the headache, cough but also the runny nose. It is so embarrassing when they forget to take a handkerchief or tissue along with them.\nWant to stay away from colds? Put on a happy face.\nCompared to unhappy people, those who are cheerful and relaxed are less likely to suffer from colds, according to a new study. It's possible that being happy helps the body fight illnesses, say the researchers from New York University.\n\"It seems that positive  feelings may reduce  the danger of illness,\" said the study's chief researcher Sheldon Cohen.\nIn an earlier study, Cohen found that people who were cheerful and lively caught coughs and colds less often. People _ were also less likely to tell their doctors that they felt ill.\nIn this study, Cohen has interviewed 193 adults every day for two weeks. During the interviews, the people told researchers that they were given colds by doctors and had to stay alone in a room for six days.\nThe results showed that everyone in the study was equally  likely to get ill. But for people who said they felt happy during the research period, their illness are less serious and lasted for a shorter time.\nCohen believes that when people experience positive feelings, their body may produce a chemical that helps fight illness and disease. So if you are worried about your health, look on the brighter side more often.", "id": "high8913.txt"}
