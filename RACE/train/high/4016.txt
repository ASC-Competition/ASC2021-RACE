But sometimes those plants are related, and there are benefits to not wasting resources on being competitive, and there is not really a cost to not being competitive as long as your neighbor is also not being competitive.\"\nLearning and memory appear to be important for kin recognition in animals, but this isn't an option for plants, she noted.\nSome researchers speculate  that plants communicate through their roots, identifying themselves using tiny chemical signatures specific to each plant's family.", "id": "high4016.txt"}
