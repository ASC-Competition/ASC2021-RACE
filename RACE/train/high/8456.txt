QQ Coins can buy you accessories   for your QQ images. More importantly, a new digital currency, Bitcoin, is bringing the world's commerce online.\nIf you're traveling, you can spend Bitcoins at restaurants and hotels listed at BitcoinTravel.com. In China, Bitcoins can be used to buy goods at about 134 online shops on Taobao.  And at a cafe named 2nd Place in Beijing, you can even buy fresh coffee with Bitcoins.\nSo what makes Bitcoin so attractive to investors?\nFirst of all, the Bitcoin system is not controlled by anyone. One central authority cannot make policies to change the value of Bitcoins. The fixed amount of Bitcoins also means they cannot lose value through inflation , as all forms of paper money have done over time.\nIn addition, accounts in the Bitcoin system are anonymous and transparent. Users can set up an account easily and track every Bitcoin. All of these features seem to make Bitcoins immune  from loss, but that is not entirely true.\n\"The value of Bitcoins can vary wildly as no central government makes the price of them steady. If the value drops suddenly, investors cannot get any compensation ,\" Zhao Qingming, a senior researcher at China Construction Bank, told China Economic Weekly. And Bitcoins, unlike company shares, are not backed by any tangible funds, which also adds to their risk.\nWhile China will not recognize the digital currency anytime soon, Xinhua said, lawmakers and officials at a hearing on Nov. 18 in the US made positive comments about Bitcoin.\nBen Bernanke, outgoing chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Washington Post that \"these types of creations, such as Bitcoin... may hold long-term promise, particularly if its system promotes a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.\"", "id": "high8456.txt"}
