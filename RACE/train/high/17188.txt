That was a typical   British Sunday in the 1960s. But things now could not be more different.\nSome British sociologists recently studied the typical British Sunday. They found that people get up later and do less housework than they did 40 years ago. They are far more likely to be out shopping or enjoying themselves than cooking Sunday lunch.\nSunday mornings were busy 40 years ago. Most women caught up on their weekly housework and cooked a nice lunch. They seldom allowed themselves any \"leisure\" until afternoon, after the dishes were cleaned. Then there would be another rush to the table between 5:00 pm and 6:00 pm for tea.\nBut now, Britons can have brunch   at the restaurant. Fewer people bother  to cook themselves.\n              \"You only have two free days a week. You don't want to have to waste one because there is nothing to do but watch boring TV,\" said Elizabeth Biggs, 25, a producer in London.\n\"On Saturday you are recovering from the week,\" Biggs added. \"Sundays are the last chance for the weekend -- you want to get as much as you can out of the day before you have to go back to work.\"\nIn the past, British women usually did their shopping during the week, while the husband was at work. \"Now men seem to do that as much as women,\" said Jonathan Gershuny, a professor who took part in the study.\nMen also do more housework now on Sundays. Back in the 1960s, men were far more likely to spend Sundays out of the house -- at the pub or playing football -- before lunch.", "id": "high17188.txt"}
