It can recite many facts. For example, Smarter Child knows every baseball player in every team this season.\nHe knows every word in the dictionary and the weather in every major city areas across the US. However, if you ask Smarter Child other questions, you get strange answers. A question about Smarter Child's age returns, \"One year, 11 days, 16 hours, 7 minutes, and 47 seconds!\" Asking where he lives gets, \"In a clean room in a high-tech building in California.\"\nSmarter Child uses the vast information on the World Wide Web as his memory bank. To answer questions about spelling, for instance, Smarter Child goes to American Heritage Dictionary online. For the weather, he visits www.intellicast.com.\nSome scientists believe that by joining the many systems of the Internet, an artificial  being with the combined knowledge of, say, Albert Einstein, Richard Nixon and Britney Spears could be born. However, if Smarter Child wants to think and learn on his own like the boy-computer David in the movie A. I. Artificial Intelligence, he must solve two problems.\nThe first is that computers find it difficult to read web pages because the files  are sorted in different ways. That's why programmers need to tell Smarter Child where to look for the weather. It would be a much more difficult task to let him find it himself.\nAnother problem is that while Smarter Child can process information more exactly and faster than any human, he lacks common sense--a basic grounding of knowledge that is obvious to any young child.", "id": "high1671.txt"}
