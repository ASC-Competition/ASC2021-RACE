It's not unusual to hear about treasure hunters searching the ocean for gold and other precious metals lost at sea, but finding $ 1million in your office ceiling is an uneasy thing and a valuable one too, given that demand for gold has reached a new height recently. In 2011, about 31 grams of gold was valued at $ 1,920.30.\nIn all, 497 gold coins were discovered, raining down upon the workers who were busy repairing the building. Made between 1851 and 1928, the coins have a face value marking of $ 20 each. However, together they are now worth nearly $ 1million, according to the newspaper. Lange says he will keep half of the money for himself, and the other half will be shared with the workers who made the discovery. No one knows for sure who placed the coins in the building, but the newspaper reports the building was owned by a wine producer in the 1930s.\nPeople haven't known much about these coins for now but don't be surprised if this \"buried\" treasure story still has another chapter to be told. After all, the $ 1 million of gold coins once belonged to somebody. Just look at the recent legal case being argued between Spain and people who found more than $500 million worth of gold coins in a sunken ship.", "id": "high22837.txt"}
