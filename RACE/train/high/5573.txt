Looking for easier ways to search the Web and send email, he bought Apple's iPad. The company has sold 3.27 million iPads since they entered the market in April. Although it's impossible to know with certainty how many seniors   are buying them, evidence suggests that it's a hit with seniors.\nThe iPad's intuitive interface   makes it attractive to seniors around the world, says Takahiro Miura, a researcher at the University of Tokyou. \"The iPad is a good tool for seniors because it's very easy to use,\" he says. \"Unlike the PC, it doesn't require former knowledge.\"\nJames Cordwell, a researcher in London, says the iPad's popularity with seniors is helping Apple reach beyond its traditional base of young customers. \"The world's population, especially in developed markets, is getting older.
