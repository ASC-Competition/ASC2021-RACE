J.K Rowling's wizard is not alone.The past decade has been a harvest for good children's books, which has set off a large quantity of films and an increased sales of classics such as The Lord of the Rings.\nYet despite that, reading is increasingly unpopular among children.According to statistics in 1997, 23% said they didn't like reading at all.In 2003, 35% didn't.And around 6% of the children leave primary school each year unable to read properly.\nMaybe the decline is caused by the increasing availability of computes games.Maybe the books boom has affected only the top of the educational pile.Either way, Chancellor Cordon Brown plans to change things for the bottom of the class.In his pre-budget report, he announced the national project of Reading Recovery to help the children struggling most.\nReading Recovery is aimed at six year olds, who receive four months of individual daily half-hour classes with a specially trained teacher.An evaluation this year reported that children on the school made 20 months' progress in just one year, whereas similarly weak readers without special help made just five months' progress ,and so ended the year even further below the level expected for their age.\nInternational research tends to find that when British children leave primary school, they read well, but read text often for fun than those elsewhere.Reading for fun matters because children who are keen on reading can report lifelong pleasure and loving books is an excellent indicator of future educational success.According to the OECD, being a regular and enthusiastic reader is of great advantage.", "id": "high3761.txt"}
