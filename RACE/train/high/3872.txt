Reactions from Americans are mixed. More than half of the people questioned in a survey think e-cigarettes should be controlled by the US Food and Drug Administration, but 47 percent believe the e-cigarettes should be available to the smokers who want to quit.\n\"In the hunt for a safter cigarette, e-cigarettes are becoming a popular choice among those either trying to quit.\"or looking to replace standard tobacco smoke with an alternative that manufacturers claim to be safer, \"Zogby International, which conducted the survey, said in a statement.\nAbout half of the 4,611 adults who took part in the survey had heard about e-cigarettes, which are battery-powered, or rechargeable cigarettes that vaporize a liquid nicotine solution. They do not produce smoke but a water vapor without smell. Sold mostly on the Internet, e-cigarettes were first made in China.\nLast year the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against using e-cigarettes, saying there was no evidence to prove they were safe or helped smokers break the habit. The WHO said people who smoke e-cigarettes breathe in a fine fog of nicotine into the lungs.\nNearly a third of people questioned in the survey think that e-cigarettes should be allowed in places where smoking is forbidden, because they don't produce smoke, but 46 percent disagree. Men who were aware of the availability of e-cigarettes were more likely than woman to say they should be a choice available to smokers who want to quit. Young people, aged 18-29, and singles were the groups most open to trying e-cigarettes.
