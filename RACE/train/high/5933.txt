As eh New York Times writes, the symphony, \"contains some of the most spiritual and peaceful music ever written.\"\nAs the cell phone continued to ring, the iPhone's signature ringtone, Gilbert stopped the entire performance. And yet shockingly the phone continued to ring. \"Nothing happened,\" Gilbert told the Times, \"Nobody was to blame for it. It was unbelievable.\"\nGilbert said minor cell phone interruptions have become common and rarely _ a live performance. The Philharmonic does what it can to remind to audience to turn off their cell phones before the performance begins. But the audience and performers stood by in astonished silence as Gilbert asked the offender  to silence the phone, only to hear it continue.\nMr Gilbert said audience pointed out two people sitting where the sound was coming from. \"They were staring at me firmly,\" he said of the couple. Eventually, the man put his hand in his pocket and the ringing stopped.\nThe conductor said he asked the man if he was sure the phone was quieted. \"Then he nodded his head,\" Mr Gilbert said.\nPeople in the hall had been shouting for the sound to stop. Mr Pelkonen reported that they yelled: \"Thousand-dollar fine!\" \"Kick him out!\" \"Get out!\"\nOnce the phone was finally silenced, Gilbert apologized to the audience. They responded with cheers and applause . And the performance continued.", "id": "high5933.txt"}
