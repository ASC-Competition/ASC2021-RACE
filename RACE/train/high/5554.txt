To meet the needs of these people, a pet hotel has been built near the Disney World Resort in Florida.\nThe new pet hotel is named Best Friends Pet Care Resort and it is mainly open to dogs and cats. It has an area of 4,645m2. About 270 dogs and 30 cats can be kept there at the same time. Besides dogs and cats, it can also provide services for birds, pigs and rabbits. However, it can't take care of snakes and turtles  now.\nBest Friend Pet Care Resort is a very expensive hotel. There are several types of dog rooms, such as rooms with air-conditioners  and VIP rooms. There is even a \"private dog park\". Owners can have a high-quality vacation with their dogs there.
