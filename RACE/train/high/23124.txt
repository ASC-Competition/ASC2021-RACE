For the first time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the prefix = st1 /USis recommending that all children aged from 6 months to 18 years receive the flu vaccine.\nVaccines battle diseases caused by bacteria and viruses. A weakened form of the germ   is introduced into the body. The body makes special substances called antibodies to fight the germs. If the actual germs were to attack, the antibodies would fight it.\n       Because there are many kinds of flu viruses, scientists must create a new vaccine  formula   each year. Researchers must make a prediction.\nIt is like forecasting the weather. Sometimes they are right on, and sometimes they are off. But even when the vaccinedoes not closely match circulating flu types, it can make the illness less serious.\n \"The flu vaccine is not as effective as the polio   vaccine or the measles vaccine,\" says Dr William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \"It's not a great vaccine, but it is quite a good vaccine.\"\nBut a flu vaccine doesn't work for everyone. There are certain people who should be careful about taking it.\nBecause the vaccine is produced in eggs, those who are allergic   to eggs should not take it. If you have a fever, you should wait until you recover.\nSome people are afraid that they might get the flu from the flu shot. Scientists say that it is not possible, because the viruses in the flu shot are inactivated. But some minor side effects such as low-grade fever and body ache could occur. If they do, they begin soon after the shot and usually last only one to two days.\nDid you know?\nSmallpox was the first disease people tried to prevent by putting a virus into a healthy person. In 1796, English scientist Edward Jenner placed some infected   material under a boy's skin.", "id": "high23124.txt"}
