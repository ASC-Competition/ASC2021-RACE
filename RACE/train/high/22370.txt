Short and frequent hikes, needing no planning or special equipment, are enjoyed by most people.\n   *Keep in shape by walking at a fast pace for at least 15 minutes every day. Climbing stairs instead of using a lift and running not too far are also good ways of keeping in shape.\n   *On any hike nothing is more important than good, comfortable shoes.\n   *The things you take might include matches in a waterproof box, a knife, compass, map first aid items and flashlight.\n   *Cameras may be taken, but don't load with too much.\n   *On longer hikes keep a comfortable, steady pace and take rest stops often.\n   *Drink only safe water. If in doubt, boil the water.\n   *Don't go along the busy roads. When you have to use a road, keep as far over on the left as possible.\n   *Leave word at home or some other place as to where you are going and when you plan to return.\n   *On almost any hike, a map is a good idea. If going into a strange place, a detailed map is most useful.\n   *Take along a field guide on flowers, birds, rocks, or other subjects depending upon your interests.
