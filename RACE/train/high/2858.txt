With rage in her voice she shouted, \"Pull me up!I give up, I hate this. This is stupid!\" It was at that moment when Jason, the adviser on the trip, looked at me and said, \"Ed, I'm going to go down and talk with her.\" I then shouted down to Alexis, \"Hold on! You can do this. We know you can!\"\nJason grasped another rope, put his climbing harness on and began to repel down the cliff. Within moments Jason was beside Alexis. She had her cheek directly against the face of the rock with her feet barely resting on a small piece of the cliff that jetted outward. Jason said to Alexis, \"I know that you have been on this cliff now for what seems like a long time. Your feet and fingers are cramping up and your forearms feel as though they are on fire. But , Alexis, you are strong, look how far up you are already. You have taken one of the more difficult paths up the cliff. Look Alexis, look at the path you have taken.\"\nAt that moment, Alexis moved her cheek away from the rock face and looked down. The bright white chalk she used on her hands to give her a better hold, showed the path where her tired hands had moved her upward on the cliff. Jason was right. Alexis had taken the hardest way up the cliff. Jason then looked straight into Alexis' eyes and in a calm voice he said, \"You are not alone out here, there are people who care about you, who want to help you and see you succeed. We are going to do this together. Are you ready?\" Slowly she shook her head yes and took a deep breath.", "id": "high2858.txt"}
