This event aims to gather the views and opinions of students not only in Victoria and Australia, but around the globe. On Sunday 29 July 2012 students will discuss a series of questions regarding the role of education in the 21st century. By the end of the day they will hopefully have comprehensive answers to be shared with schools around the state and maybe even the world.\nStudents from Preshill would like to invite a group of 5-10 students from your school to participate in this free forum . The event is being held on Sunday 29 July 2012 from 10am-2.30pm at the Hawthorn Town Hall, 360 Burwood Rd, Hawthorn. They are inviting students who are enthusiastic on any of our topics of discussion to present a keynote speech on the day.\nIf you can't make the day, they welcome your written or recorded thoughts on our questions, which will be on display at the event.\nThe topics for discussion:\nKey Question: What is the ideal 21st century education?\n1. Is it a school's place to teach ethics, values, morals, confidence, self-esteem?\n2. What are the effects of a uniform national curriculum ?\n3. How can we make education more engaging?\n4. Should students be compared and ranked against each other?\n5. What is the place of social networking and new media technology in education?\n6.
