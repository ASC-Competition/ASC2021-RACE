For breakfast? But the truth is that you can have last night's _ in the a. m. if you want to.\nI know lots of women who skip breakfast   , and they have a ton of different excuses for doing it . Some say they don't have time, others think they're \"saving\" calories  , still others just don't like breakfast food .\nBut the bottom line is that eating in the morning is very important when you're trying to lose weight. \"Eating just about anything from 300 to 400 calories would be better than nothing at all,\" says Katherine Brooking , R , D , who developed the super-easy eating plan for this year's \"SELF CHALLENGE\". And even pizza can be healthy if it's loaded with vegetables, and you stick to one small piece.\nBreakfast is one meal I never miss, and the same goes for most weight loss success stories. Research shows that eating breakfast keeps you from overeating later in the day. Researchers at the University of Southern California found that breakfast skippers have a bigger chance of gaining weight than those who regularly have a morning meal.\nSo eat something in the morning, anything. I know plenty of friends who end up having no breakfast altogether, and have just coffee or orange juice. I say, try heating up last night's leftovers-it may sound crazy, but if it works for you, do it! I find if I tell myself, \"You can always eat it tomorrow,\" I put away the leftovers instead of eating more that night. Try it...you may save yourself some pre-bedtime calories. And watch your body gain the fat-burning effects.", "id": "high2640.txt"}
