Now scientists have discovered the same thing happens with the songs of another creature----the humpback whale. The mammals become absorbed by new tunes just like people do, and the most popular original whale songs spread globally like hit singles.\nMale humpback whales are famed for the loud, long and complicated songs they make during the mating season. Each song lasts for 10 to 20 minutes and the males can sing nonstop for 24 hours. At any one time, all the males in a population sing the same song.\nBut a study shows that this song changes over time and spreads around the oceans. Dr. Ellen Garland of Queensland University, said: \"Songs move like cultural communication from one population to another, causing all males to change their song to a new version.\"\nResearchers recorded songs from six neighboring populations of whales in the Pacific over a decade. They found that new versions of the songs appear over time and always spread from west to east. It takes two years for songs that appear in the waters off Australia to be heard in French Polynesia.\nMost of the new songs contain material from the previous year mixed with something new. \" It would be like getting an old Beatles song together with U2,\" she said. \" Occasionally they completely throw the current song out of the window and start singing a completely new song\".\nDr. Garland believes that a small number of whales may migrate to other populations carrying the new songs with them, or that they are heard by passing whales.\nThe researchers suspect whales adopt new songs to make themselves distinct. Dr. Garland said: \" we think this male search for new songs is in the hope of being that little bit different and perhaps more attractive to the opposite sex.\"", "id": "high7604.txt"}
