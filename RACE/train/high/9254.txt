Make a list of the most important things you need to learn,in order of importance,and hit the items at the top of the list first.That way,if you run out of time,you're mostly covered.Make a list of all the work you have to do,estimate how much time each item will take,and compare that with the amount of hours you have available;this will tell you if you can carefully read or just skim,how many times you can afford to revise papers,and other ways to pace yourself so you can get everything done.If you're pressed for time,it's important to learn to let go of being perfect.Oh,and turn off the TV as much as possible until your tests are behind you.\nVisualize Success\nBefore you fall asleep each night,it is a great way to visualize yourself taking the tests and doing wonderfully.Detailed visualizations can help you feel like you're really experiencing something,and visualizing yourself doing well is a way to 'practice' success in a way that can actually help you perform better and feel confident.Being confident as you take your exams can keep you from choking because of the stress.Visualizations can also help you to remember facts: you can create detailed scenarios that involve the information you're trying to remember,and this can help cement the facts in your memory.\nStay Calm\nBecause stress can impair your memory,it's important to stay calm before and during tests.While that's easier said than done,there are several stress relief techniques that can help you calm down quickly whenever you feel overwhelmed.For example,breathing exercise has been shown by research to reduce test anxiety,and can be extremely effective in helping you relax and reverse your stress response in a variety of situations: just take deep breaths,expanding your belly on the inhale,and let the stress come out with your exhales.", "id": "high9254.txt"}
