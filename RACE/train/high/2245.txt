He told this story about himself: he began earning $125 a week at the age of 23. That was a lot of money in those days. Young Momand was very proud of his riches. He got married and moved with his wife to Long Island, outside New York City.\nBut just moving there was not enough. For when Momand and his wife saw that their neighbors belonged to a country club they too joined a club. And when he saw that rich people were expected to ride horses, Momand went horseback riding every day. Momand and his wife also hired a servant and gave grand parties for their new neighbors.\nIt was like a race, but one could never finish this race because one was always trying to keep up. Momand and his wife could not do that.\nThe race ended for them when they could no longer pay for their new way of life. They moved back to an inexpensive New York City apartment.\nMomand later said that his experience had been a cruel awakening for him. However, he was able to see the funny side of it. He looked around him and noticed that many people do things just to keep up with their neighbors.\nHe decided that this would make good stories for many papers across the country. He called it \"Keeping up with the Joneses\", because \"Jones\" is a very common American name. \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's stories appeared in different newspapers for over 28 years.\nPeople never seem to tire of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read the \"right\" books, go to the \"right\" universities and eat in the \"right\" restaurants. But no matter what one does, Mr. Jones always seems to be ahead.", "id": "high2245.txt"}
