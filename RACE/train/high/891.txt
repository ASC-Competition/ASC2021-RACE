In school restaurants across the country, cheaper fruits like apples and oranges have taken their place.\n\"People are afraid to spend now.\" said Linda Morrow, who owns a shoe and handbag store. \"They don't know what the future will bring\". During the financial crisis  , several of the country's biggest banks have been forced to sell or close. This has made lots of Americans afraid to buy expensive things.\nThe crisis began last year. Experts   think it was because US banks lend money too easily. Last year a lot of people and companies, who borrowed money, found themselves unable to pay it back. This left the banks, as well as the people who put their money in the banks, without money.
