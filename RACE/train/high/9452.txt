But no one cancelled on the advice of the organizers, the Chinese Athletic Association and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sports, because those organizations did not call it off. That has made participants call the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), which has approved the 26-mile, or 42-kilometer race, to set air quality standards in the future to avoid damaging the runners' health. The association could not be reached by telephone on Sunday.\n\"Does the IAAF have guidelines?\" asked Chas Pope, a British engineer who took part in the marathon on Sunday. \"If they don't, they should consider it,\" said Mr. Pope, who has lived in Beijing for 11 years and runs several long-distance races each year. \"It's meant to be fun and good for your health,\" Mr. Pope said of the marathon. \"But in such air, it's just ridiculous to be running,\" he said. He abandoned the course. \"Most of my overseas friends pulled out,\" he said. \"And quite a few of my Chinese friends too, but a lot didn't. I think they don't know as much about the health impact.\"\nImages on Twitter and Chinese social media showed Chinese runners wearing a variety of face protections, from light cloth masks to World War I-style gas masks. Still many completed the race without masks. \"Today's race should definitely have been called off or rescheduled,\" said Zhang Kai, Beijing-based campaigner with Greenpeace East Asia. \"What happened today to this sports even is just another reminder to the government that much remains to be done to China's energy and industrial structure to solve pollution,\" said Mr. Zhang. \"If the battle against pollution is a marathon, it is now time to catch up on speed.\"\nIn the end, the race was won by two Ethiopians: Girmay Birhanu Gebru won the men's race in 2 hours, 10 minutes and 42 seconds while Fatuma Sado Dergo won the women's in 2 hours, 30 minutes and 3 seconds, breaking Chinese women's advantage of the race for the last 22 years.\nThe favored Chinese woman runner, Gong Lihua, told China News Net that the smog didn't affect her too much but it interfered with many people's ability to sweat, affecting their performance.", "id": "high9452.txt"}
