She had been the one who had always guided and supported me, and now I realized I needed her love for the rest of my life. Had falling in love with Dora been a mistake? We had both been very young, it is true. I had always called Agnes sister, and now perhaps I no longer had the right to ask whether her love for me was more than sisterly.\nHowever, I decided to return, and travelled home to England, after three years of absence. I was delighted to find that Traddles had married his Sophy, and was doing well as a lawyer. My aunt had moved back to her old Dover house, and was living happily there with Mr.Dick and Peggotty. When I visited my aunt, I took the opportunity of asking her about Agnes. \n\"Has she--has she any young man she'd like to marry?\" I asked as lightly as possible. \nMy aunt looked carefully at me as she replied, \"I suspect she has, David. She's never mentioned it to me, but I think--I feel sure she's going to marry soon.\"\nI was firm with myself and did not show my feelings. I borrowed a horse and rode to Canterbury to ask Agnes myself. When I saw that beautiful, gentle face again, I knew I had come home. I knew how dear she was to me, and would always be. \n\"Agnes,\" I said, \"I am so grateful to you, for making me what I am, for helping me to be good! But I think you have a secret. Let me share it, Agnes, as your brother! Tell me whom you love!\" \nAgnes turned away from me and burst into tears. Somehow these tears did not sadden me, but gave me hope. \"My dear Agnes! Don't cry!\"\n\"David, leave me! I can't talk about it now!\" she sobbed. \n\"Agnes, you're dearer to me than anything in the world. Don't think I'll be jealous of any man you choose to marry. I only want you to be happy!\"\nShe had stopped crying now and was calmer. \"If I have a secret, David, it is--not a new one. It has been my secret--for a long time!\"\nI was wild with hope. \"Not a new one!\" Did she mean ...? \"Dearest Agnes! Dare I hope to call you more than a sister!\" She was in my arms and sobbing again, but this time with happiness. \"I went away, Agnes, loving you! I returned home, loving you!\" \nWe held each other for some time, sure now of each other's love. \n\"There is something I must tell you, David,\" she said gently, looking calmly into my face. \"I have loved you all my life!\" She added, \"And something else--before our sweet Dora died, she asked me--can you guess--to fill the empty place in your heart.\" And Agnes laid her head on my shoulder, and cried. And I cried with her, although we were both so happy.", "id": "high18907.txt"}
