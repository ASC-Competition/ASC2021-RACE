After a long but useless efforts, they all said that it could not be done.\n\"And yet, my boys,\" said the father, \"nothing is easier to do.\" He then untied the bundle, and broke the sticks, one by one, with perfect ease.\n\"Ah!\" said his sons, \"It is easy enough to do it so; anybody could do it in that way.\"\nTheir father replied, \"As it is with these sticks, so it is with you, my sons. So long as you hold fast together and help each other, you will be much richer, and none can harm you.\n\"But if the brotherhood bundle is broken, it will happen to you just as it has to these sticks, which lie there broken on the ground.\"\nHome, city, country, all are property found, When they hold tightly together.", "id": "high7951.txt"}
