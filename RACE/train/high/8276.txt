Here are some of the city's best annual events.\nRoskilde Festival (July)\nThe Danes love the outdoors and they love rock music; the Roskilde Festival is where they combine these passions for a weekend of drunken celebration. The four-day event is held about 30 minutes from the city completely, which means you can either go in for the full festival experience, or you can travel from the city to the festival each day.\nThere are also day tickets if you don't have the power for the whole collection of facts.\nKulturnatten (October)\nFor something a little more high brow there's the Night of Culture. For one night only some 300 venues in the city stage theater performances, art exhibitions, concerts and poetry readings.\nFather Christmas Congress (July)\nOne of the more bizarre fixtures in Copenhagen's calendar, the event is held in July--the slow season for Santas--at the Bakken amusement park, some 20 minutes north of the city. The most interesting of the event is a procession of Santas from all over the world along Stroget. Parents should be prepared for some embarrassed questions from the kids.\nTivoli Gardens (November/December)\nThese pleasure gardens make for a great day out any time of the year but to see them at their most attractive, visit from mid-November through December, when they are transformed into a fairy tale of lanterns and Christmas markets. There's also outdoor skating, a Christmas entertainment and the very Danish 'Nissekobing' village, home to more than 100 mechanical fairies.", "id": "high8276.txt"}
