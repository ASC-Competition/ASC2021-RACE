They order clothes and they don't fit. People get very unhappy.\"\nWong and her design partner, Xuaner \"Cecilia\" Zhang, are Team White Mirror, creators of what they call a \"virtual  fitting room\". Their goal is simple and consumer-friendly: to let online clothing shoppers have a perfect fit and a perfect look when shopping every time. Both women are from China, Wong from Hong Kong and Zhang from Beijing. They both order most of their clothing online. They got the idea from their own experience as consumers and from listening to the complaints of friends and relatives. \"They say, 'The color is wrong' or 'I got the right size but it still does not fit.' We want to make it like you're in the store trying on the clothes,\" Zhang said.\nUsing a Kinect developed by Microsoft for use with its Xbox 360 video game player, Zhang scans Wong and turns her image into, in effect, a virtual model, keeping Wong's dimensions  , and even her skin and hair color. \"We put the clothes on the shopper's 3-D body models and show how they look when they are dressed,\" Wong said. So far, Wong and Zhang have adapted the software to show dresses and shirts, and they are now working on shorts.\nAsked if she thought men as well as women might be interested in using their virtual fitting room, Wong said, \"I think their wives will care about this, so it will also be important to men.\"", "id": "high14737.txt"}
