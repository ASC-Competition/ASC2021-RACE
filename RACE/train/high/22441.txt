However, she also enjoys happy times with friends, even though they have a lot of arguments.\n\"The thing about me and my friends is that one minute we're up and then the next we're down; one minute I want to shout the house down, the next I feel so happy that I just want to hug everyone in the room at once,\" she said to British paper The Independent.\nWilson's generation have all the latest fashions and electronic equipment. But owning them does not necessarily make them happier.

But happy children tend to  have their own bedroom, a bike or other leisure equipment.\nChildren who have friends over for tea once a fortnight   and those who go swimming once a month were also happier with their lives than those who do not.\nA sense of belonging clearly had an influence on how satisfied people were.

Girls also become very conscious   of the way they look and the way they are treated,\" Knies told UK newspaper The Observer. \"In general boys don't face the same pressures.\"", "id": "high22441.txt"}
