One of the problems when people get sick from food is that the simplest question is often difficult or even impossible to answer. Just what did the people eat that made them sick?\nOf course, one way to avoid these medical mysteries is to keep dangerous organisms out of the food supply. This is easier said than done, but scientists keep looking for new ways.\nScientists in the United States have developed an experimental system that uses a high-tech optical scanner. The system is designed to identify the presence of contaminants  like soil or animal waste on fresh produce. These can be sources of E. coli. E. coli bacteria naturally live in the intestines  of humans and many animals. Most kinds of E. coli are harmless but some can make people sick.\nThe new scanner can also show damage and imperfections that might make the produce unappealing to shoppers.\nScientists designed the system at a Department of Agriculture research center in Beltsville, Maryland. Moon Kim of the Agricultural Research Service led the team.\nMOON KIM: \"We were requested, we were asked, to develop a method to detect contamination in produce. So we started with the apple as the model sample.\"\nThe scanner uses a high-speed camera placed over the conveyer belt that moves the produce along. As the apples move along the belt, the scanner captures images of each piece of fruit.\nMoon Kim says the team hopes the system will be available before long.\nMOON KIM: \"We are targeting for development in commercial plants for the next several years.\"\nThe scanner can direct a sorting machine to separate the bad apples from the good ones. The system is currently able to show the surface of only half the apple as it speeds by. The inventers hope to improve the process so it can show the whole surface.", "id": "high3502.txt"}
