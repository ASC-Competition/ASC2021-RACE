Polly's son, Jim, had great difficulty in school. He was classified as the educationally handicapped and required a great deal of patience on the part of his parents and teachers. But Jim was a happy kid with a great smile that lit up the room. His parents knew his difficulties, but they always tried to help him see his strengths so that he could walk with pride. Shortly after Jim finished high school, he was killed in a motorcycle accident. After his death, his mother submitted this letter to the newspaper.\n\"Today we buried our 20-year-old son. He was killed in a motorcycle accident on Friday night. How I wish I had known that the last time I had talked to him would be the last time. If I had only known that, I would have said to him, 'Jim, I love you and I'm always so proud of you.' I would have taken the time to count the many blessings he had brought to the lives of the people who loved him. I would have taken the time to appreciate his beautiful smile, his laughter, and his genuine love to other people.\n\"When I put all the good things on the scale and try to balance them with all the irritating   things such as the radio that was always too loud, the haircut that wasn't to our liking, the dirty socks under the bed, etc., I find that the irritations really don't amount to much.\n\"I won't get another chance to tell my son all that I would have wanted him to hear, but, other parents, do have a chance. Tell your young people what you would want them to hear as if it may be your last conversation. The last time I talked to Jim was the morning of the day when he died. He called me to say, 'Hi, Mom! I just called to say I love you. You have to go to work now. Bye.' That day, he gave me something to treasure forever. \"\nIf there is any purpose at all for Jim's death, maybe it is to make others appreciate life more and to tell people, especially family members, that they should take the time to let each other know just how much they care. You may never have another chance. Do it today!", "id": "high938.txt"}
