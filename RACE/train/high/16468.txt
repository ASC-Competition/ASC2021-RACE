Francis Chan, an engineer, lives in Hampstead, north London, in a flat that's just 4ft wide by 21ft long. He loves it.\nTiny though it is, it has got all the comforts. Peter Baynes, Chan's architect  ,has achieved a clever piece of design, according to architectural experts.\nThe Chan mini-house was built on what was once a path down the side of a big Victarian house. Not an inch of space is wasted.\nWhen you step in through the front door, you're standing in the shower, on Britain' s only self-cleansing doormat  . A door opens on to an equally tiny toilet with washbasin. Two steps further in comes the kitchen, complete with full-sized cooker and fridge, and washer/ drier. A worktop folds down from the wall.\nAnother step and you're into the dining/ office area. Four people can sit here for dinner, says Chan as he sets the table-top into place. He even has a fold-down drawing-board for when he's working at home. The bed is hidden under a cover board right at the back. \"I don't even have to make the bed,\" Chan says.\" I just put the cover down. \"\nChan's business suits hang neatly on the wall over the bed. Daylight comes in through the skylight. The house feels like a very small boat and Chan admits he toyed with the idea of naming it the \"boat-house\".\n\"It cost around PS4,700 to build last year. Now it's been valued at PS30,000. It proves that good design doesn't need to cost more. It just needs a lot of care.\" says Chan.", "id": "high16468.txt"}
