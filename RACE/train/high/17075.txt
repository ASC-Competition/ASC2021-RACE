She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \"Tennessee Waltz\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit  . \nBorn in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own.\nAt age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\" and \"Old Cape Cod\".\nHer last hit was \"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \"Doggie in the Window\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics  , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. \nThroughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \"The Big Record\". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series \"The Patti Page Show\". She continued to record and perform into the 21st century, most recently releasing an album of songs for children, a Christmas record, and a new \"best of\" collection.\nBesides music, Patti Page did a bit of acting. She co-starred with the Oscar-winning Burt Lancaster in \"Elmer Gantry\", and also starred on stage in the musical play \"Annie Get Your Gun\".", "id": "high17075.txt"}
