But if you had to decide, which of the two animals would you say you might like better? Your answer may say something about your personality.\nAccording to a 2010 study led by Sam Gosling, a scientist at the University of Texas, US, dog people are about 15 percent more outgoing and 13 percent more pleasant to be friends with than cat people.\nThis is not hard to understand, since cats and dogs behave differently themselves. \"Cats will occasionally _ social activities, but usually after only a few minutes, they will abandon the game. Dogs, on the other hand, will often engage in play, like fetching a thrown ball, for hours at a time,\" said Modern Dog Magazine.\nAlthough cat people are less social, Gosling's study showed that they are 11 percent more open-minded than dog people. They usually like art, adventures and unusual ideas. They also have more imagination and curiosity. But dog people are more likely to stick to old beliefs and traditional interests.\nHowever, their love of a free lifestyle also means that cat people dislike making plans. They just follow whatever ideas pop into their heads without planning ahead. But dog people are different. They usually have strong self-control and like to carry out their plans.\nDespite these big differences between dog people and cat people, there are some things that they have in common, \"Both types of people consider themselves close to nature, dislike animal-print clothing, and are generally optimists,\" noted Mother Nature Network.\nBut can personality change? Can a cat person become a dog person, or the other way around? In a study done by Stanley Coren, a scientist based in Canada, he asked cat owners: \"If you had enough living space and there were no objections form other people in your life, and someone gave you a puppy as a gift, would you keep it?\"\nAbout 68 percent of them said they would not accept a dog as a pet. But when dog owners were asked the same question about a kitten, almost 70 percent said they would allow a cat into their lives.", "id": "high6084.txt"}
