As I was getting my wheelchair off the back, a man watched me from his car and I noticed a wheelchair in his back seat. We spoke for a moment and I asked him about the wheelchair. He answered that it was for his daughter. \"Well, do you think she would like to go for a ride on my motorbike with me?\" I asked. He seemed shocked that a total stranger would ask him this. He thought about it for a second and said, \"OK, as long as I can follow you.\"\nHe introduced me to Amy and he sat her on my back seat. Her father followed me for a few miles and she talked non-stop about what she wanted for Christmas.\nAs we came back to the convenience store, she said, \"This ride is the best Christmas present I could ever receive. I have been in a wheelchair my whole life and didn't know I could do this.\" I told her about some of the other things I do (ski, travel the world by myself, etc.). As her father was taking her off my bike, she turned to him and said, \"Oh Daddy, I'm going to be OK. Mr. Bryant does all kinds of things, and I will too.\" Her father turned away as a tear of joy rolled down his cheek. He hugged me and said, \"I was sitting here praying for a gift for Amy that would encourage her. She often felt that her life was dull compared to other children. God answered my prayer just now. Now I pray that God will bless you for your gift to Amy today.\" I believed what he said. Being kind and thoughtful to others, we can be an answer to prayer.", "id": "high4670.txt"}
