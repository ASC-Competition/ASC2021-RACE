However, some parents find his methods too extreme.\n\"I'm not sure a 4-year-old is prepared for such intense training,\" said Zhang Ruxia  a woman who gave birth to two boys in October in Tianjin. \"You can have good intentions to train your child at an early age but you also have to consider whether he can take it.\" Wang responded by saying children are too young to make decisions, and it is up to parents to lead them on the right path.\n\"I read many materials before and the whole process is step-by-step without pushing or imposing on my son,\" Wang said. The father said he was not acting rashly but following a scientific way of education. He said the doubts about his methods reflect the declining standards of modern education.\n\"Many people in Japan give their children cold showers too ,and no one is fussing about it,\" he said. The traditional way of education applied by most of his peers might not necessarily help bring the best out of a child he said.\nWang said in addition to the physical training, he has also laid out a detailed and particular program to strengthen the intelligence of the child. \"I have hired some university students to expand his knowledge in natural sciences, while playing the video for English-language teaching as well,\" he said.", "id": "high5768.txt"}
