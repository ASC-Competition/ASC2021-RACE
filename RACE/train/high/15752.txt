But instead of sending me to a school for the deaf, they decided to \"\n\" me. All of my peers and teachers world have normal hearing.\nI was the only deaf child at Blue Creel Elementary School. From almost the first day there, the other kids made fun of me mainly because of my hearing aid and the way I talked. And I also had difficulty with most of my school work.\nWhen the other kids made fun of me, I was sure that I was a bad person. I saw myself as a boy who wasn't smart enough to keep up with the class.\nMrs. Jordan, my 5th grade teacher, changed all of that with a simple three-word phrase.\nOne morning, she asked the class a question. I read her lips from my front-row seat and immediately raised my hand because I was sure I had the right answer. But when she called on me, I was afraid. Here was an opportunity to impress the powerful teacher and show her I was worthy of her love. Maybe even impress my classmates a little. I didn't want to blow it. despite my fears, I took a deep breath and answered Mrs. Jordan's question.\nI will never forget what happened next. Mrs. Jordan enthusiastically slammed  her right foot on the floor and turned her tight hand around in full circle until it pointed directly at me. With sparking eyes and a wide smile she cried, \"THAT'S RIGHT STEPHEN!\"\nFor the first time in my young life, I was a star. I sat a little taller in my chair.\nFrom that day forward, my grades and speech improved greatly. My popularity among my peers increased. It was all because Mrs. Jordan believed in me and wasn't afraid to express it. \"THAT'S RIGHT STEPHEN!\"", "id": "high15752.txt"}
