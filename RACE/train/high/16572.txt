McDonald's will reduce the amount of French fries in Happy Meals and will also include sliced apple \"dippers\" in every meal. McDonald's say it will still include the ever-popular toys with each meal.\n\"We are going to introduce more food groups such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains,\" said Cindy Goody, McDonald's senior director of nutrition.\nAfter getting much of the blame for childhood obesity, fast food chains, especially McDonald's, began selling more nutritious menu items. But the restaurant was most criticized for its marketing which is often aimed at young children. Some cities, such as San Francisco, California, have banned toys from all kids' meals that didn't meet strict nutritional guidelines for fat, salt and sugar content because the prizes attracted more children to the fast food.\nMcDonald's felt public pressure to change their offerings. It reduced French fry portions from 2.4oz to 1.1oz in every meal. This decreases calorie content by about 20 percent, which means a new Happy Meal is less than 600 calories. Currently, the unhealthiest Happy Meal consists of a cheeseburger, fries and 1 percent chocolate milk, which contains 700 calories and 27 grams of fat.\nMeanwhile, Goody and her team plan to cut sodium  by 15 percent across the entire menu by 2015, with more cuts to sugar and calories by 2020. The Happy Meal changes will be in place in every place across the United States.", "id": "high16572.txt"}
