But can you believe that a school in England is using classical music to cut down students' bad behavior?\nThe head teacher Brian Walker at the West Park School in Derby asks some students to stay behind after school on Fridays. He forces his students to listen to Mozart and other classical music. He also makes them copy his favorite poems and they have to watch educational videos.\nMr. Walker says his main aim is to stop noisy pupils causing trouble in class for students who want to study. He said the students staying behind were \"not the smokers or drinkers, the truants   or the people who are late for school...It's those who have slowed the learning and teaching in class for everyone\". Mr. Walker said this was unacceptable, because it was making the rest of the students fail to focus their attention on their study.\nMr. Walker believes what he does reminds students that education is something to value. \"It helps them see they are part of something bigger that will improve their life chances,\" he said. The head teacher thinks students in fact learn from being kept behind after school. \"Hopefully, I open their ears to an experience they don't normally have and don't want to have again, so it's both educational and acts as a warning.\"\nMusic has had success elsewhere in reducing bad behavior. In 2004, it reduced crime on London's subway by 25 percent. Researchers from a Belfast university found it helped stop elephants' bad behavior.\nHowever, one West Park student called Kieran said, \"An hour of Mr. Walker's music is a real killer.\"", "id": "high8266.txt"}
