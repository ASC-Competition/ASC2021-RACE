Big Ben,the frequently changing weather, fish and chips... But have you ever wondered what British people think means \"Britain\"?\nEnglish playwright William Shakespeare and pop group The Beatles are the icons which inspire a sense of national pride in British people, according to a recent survey.\nMore than 2,000 people were asked what aspect of Britain made them feel most proud. Shakespeare topped the list, followed by the National Trust, a charity which protects places of historical or environmental interest. These beat the British currency, the pound, and the BBC.\nSurprisingly, the royal family only made it to seventh on the list. \"The royal family, while popular, does not inspire widespread pride,\" said a spokesman for Demos, the think tank  which carried out the research. \"However, it is certainly the case that -- through their unique capacity to hold and lead national events -- the royal family has a central role to play in developing pride.\"\nTerence Blacker, a reporter for The Independent, believes the study shows the nature of new patriotism . \"It turns out that modern British patriotism is not really about nationhood at all,\" he wrote.\nAccording to the poll, the most impressive symbols of national pride concerned private conduct and character. Volunteering topped the list, followed by politeness and patience.", "id": "high177.txt"}
