Even if you do nothing about it, your bad mood will probably go away after some time. But with a little effort, you can forget it much faster - often within a day or two.\n*Walk it off\nExercise is the most popular bad-mood buster. A person who's in a bad mood has low energy and high tension. Taking a fast ten-minute walk, or doing some quick exercises can do wonders towards changing that bad mood.\n*Tune it out\nListening to your favorite music for a while can also make tension go away quickly, because music starts associations with past positive experiences we've had.\n*Give yourself a pep talk\nStop and listen to what's on your mind. Bad moods are often started by too many negative thoughts. Write them all down on paper, the pessimistic messages you've been giving yourself and then give optimistic answers. ( \"I still don't have a job.\" Vs \"I have two interviews next week.\")\n*Reduce your stress\nRelaxation techniques are wonderful mood-lifters. These include deep breathing, stretching and visualizing, all of which sound complicated but aren't. One easy way to visualize: close your eyes and picture a favorite place, such as the beach. Another simple way to be against distress is to make a to-do list. One reason for being in a bad mood is feeling you have no options. By taking control over certain areas, you realize you're not helpless. You can make changes in your mood and life.\n*Avoid things that won't improve your mood.\nTV may not help much: You need to increase your energy level and stimulate  your mind - something that the TV show \"Neighbors\" won't do. And before you reach for that piece of cake and coffee, think about how mood and food are linked. Sugar and caffeine contribute to depressed moods. A better choice? Research shows that carbohydrates, such as potatoes and pasta ,produce a calming effect in people who have a desire for them.", "id": "high4182.txt"}
