It is one of the most important ways of getting information. People spend part of their spare time watching television, and much of what they learn comes from it.\n  What we see on TV-movies, news shows, sports shows, advertisements and so on have increased our knowledge and have changed the way we learn about the world today.

They spend less time playing soccer or walking in the park or playing games in the yard.\n  Of course, there are some programs on TV that are good for children.
