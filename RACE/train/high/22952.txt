You will feel embarrassed to show up without booking and having to wait for a table, leaving very bad impression on your friend, especially your girl friend. Also, be sure to check to see if you need to be properly dressed and tell your friend ahead of time what to wear.\n   When your food arrives, proper dining manners make you eat at a right pace so that you have time to talk. A good measure of how fast you should eat is to count 10 seconds between each mouthful and it's bad manners if you eat too fast and then spend the rest of the time watching your friend eat.\n   Don't make noise when having soup and chewing, or chew with your mouth open.\n   Your napkin should be placed on your lap at all times. Don't put it in any other place. If you have to get up, place it neatly on your seat.\n   When eating, put your fork straight in your mouth. Don't place your fork in the side of your mouth as it increases the chances of dropping your food, which could be very embarrassing. If you get food stuck in your mouth, don't pick it out with your fingers or fork at the table. Excuse yourself and go to the restroom and get it out with a toothpick.\n   When dining, keep your eyes on your friend at all times and try to smile between mouthfuls. Sometimes, you should make an effort to show some interest and ask questions like, \"How do you like the beef?\" If she needs, you are the one who is supposed to flag down the waiter by a gentle wave of the hand until someone notices you.", "id": "high22952.txt"}
