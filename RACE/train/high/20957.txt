The number of people over a hundred years old could go from 135,000 today to 2.2 million people by 2050.

Very, very small machines could take away rubbish, make things in factories, and help inside the human body by taking away fat. By 2012 people will be able to wear these small machines that look like watches, which will give them lots of information about their body and keep them healthy.", "id": "high20957.txt"}
