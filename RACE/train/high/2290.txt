Now, most people still consider that the pronunciation and delivery of BBC announcers is the clearest and most understandable spoken English.\nEnglish has had a strong relationship with classes and social positions. However, since the Second World War there has been a clear change of attitude towards speech snobbery , and marks of class distinction  such as styles of speech have been gradually diminishing, especially in the younger generation.\nBy the end of the 1960s, it had become clear that it was not necessary to speak standard English or even correct grammar to become popular, successful and rich.
