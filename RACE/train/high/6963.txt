Thanks to his skill and care, his young patient got well and was soon able to get up and run about again.\nThe child's mother was very much obliged to the doctor, and she called on him to thank him for what he had done for her child. \"Doctor,\" she said, \"you have saved my little son. I don't know how to thank you enough. I feel that money alone cannot repay you, so I have made this little purse with my own hands, as a sign of my gratitude. I hope you will accept it.\" The doctor stood up and said coldly, \"Madam, a little present like that is very nice between friends, but a doctor needs to be paid properly for what he has done.\" The lady was so surprised and hurt so much that she could not reply for a moment. Then she said quietly, \"Perhaps you will tell me how much your fee is?\"\n\"Fifty pounds\", he answered.\nThe lady opened the little purse and took out four fifty-pound bank notes. She handed one of them to the doctor, and put the other three back into the purse. She put the purse into her handbag and, saying good bye to the doctor, went out of the room.", "id": "high6963.txt"}
