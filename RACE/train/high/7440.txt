Haven't you noticed that you have become smarter since you started to learn a language?\nAccording to a new study by a British university, learning a second language can lead to an increase in your brain power. Researchers found that learning other languages changes grey matter. This is the area of the brain which processes information. It is similar to the way that exercise builds muscles. The study also found the effect is greater the younger people learn a second language.\nA team led by Dr Andrea Mechelli, from University College London, took a group of Britons who only spoke English. They were compared with a group of \"early _ \" who had learnt a second language before the age of five, as well as a number of later learners.\nScans showed that grey matter density in the brain was greater in bilinguals than in people without a second language. But the longer a person waited before mastering a new language, the smaller the difference.\n\" _ \"said the scientists.\nIt means that the change itself increases the ability to learn.\nProfessor Dylan Vaughan Jones of the University of Wales, has researched the link between bilingualism and math skills. \"Having two languages gives you two windows on the world and makes the brain more flexible ,\" he said. \"You are actually going beyond language and have a better understanding of different ideas.\"\nThe findings were matched in a study of native Italian speakers who had learned English as a second language between the ages of two and 34. Reading, writing, and comprehension were all tested. The results showed that the younger they started to learn, the better. \"Studying a language means you get an entrance to another world,\" explained the scientists.", "id": "high7440.txt"}
