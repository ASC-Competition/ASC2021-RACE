We discussed the invitations and the cost of the party. However, we had very different ideas about whom and how many people to invite. He thought that the people we knew had badly disappointed me by not keeping in touch with me since the death of my wife. But my idea of a relationship among people was to be friendly to everyone.\nHe said, \"Come on, Dad, where have all these so-called friendly, good people been since Mum passed away? They visited us in the past because Mum made good food.\" I replied, \"I am sorry to hear that. Is this the reason why you do not want to invite those people? It's no wonder that you are unhappy. Can you live alone? Are you teaching your children to do the same in the future?\" I asked myself where I had gone in his upbringing. My wife had often blamed me for not paying enough attention to communication with other people when I was raising our son. I realized at this moment that she was quite right.\nHours later, my son phoned me to say that he accepted his wife's advice and agreed to have a party with some of my friends. In the end, we had a great time. And he didn't \"hate\" those friends any more. \"Happy Birthday, Dad! Sorry that I have kept you away from your friends. I love you.\"\nOn hearing what he said, I was full of happiness and excitement. I was proud that he could change his mind.", "id": "high23398.txt"}
