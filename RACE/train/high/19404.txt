Maybe your gift is wrapped and your dinner plans booked for mom, step-mom, grandmother - whoever the person is who fed, cared for, taught and loved you.\nBut there are other people who said their most special Mother's Day memories rarely dealt with beautifully wrapped objects, but rather, the ways people showed they cared.\nMother's Day 2012 was the last one Jannet Walsh was able to celebrate with her mother, Margaret, who had a stroke   in 2009. In her last few years, Walsh always shot photos and videos of their visits together, and with Walsh's West Highland White Terrier, Andrew.\n\"My mother had a dog just like him, so I would tell her it was her dog, and she would hold onto his leash, even in bed up to the last few weeks before she passed away,\" Walsh said. \nAs Mother's Day approached, Walsh wanted a way to remember her mother and \"best friend\". She decided to build the memories she captured during those last few years into a video memorial - images of her mother with Andrew or quiet moments at her gravesite.\n\"I thought it good to tell the story with few words, just show my mother as she was - happy, and loved till the end,\" Walsh said.\nMother's Day was not a light-hearted subject for Wendy Bowers in the past. Her mom had walked out when she was 18, and Bowers had tried for years to become pregnant without success. She had almost convinced herself she wasn't meant to be a parent. \nBut three years after she gave up on having a baby, Bowers discovered that she was pregnant. Six weeks earlier than expected, little Nathan arrived.\nThat first year, Nathan, only 10 months old, was sick with a stomach bug. Bowers said she spent the day holding him between loads of laundry. \"I would not have been anywhere else in the world that day,\" she said. \"I wouldn't trade that first Mother's Day for anything, and I'm pretty sure Mother's Day will always be a reminder to me of just how lucky I am to even be a mom.\"", "id": "high19404.txt"}
