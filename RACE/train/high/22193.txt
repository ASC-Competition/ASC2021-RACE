But Swedish entrepreneur Oscar Dios thinks they can be persuaded otherwise and he has created a new kind of hostel to prove it.\nDios says it is the world's first jumbo (unusually large) jet hostel, an actual jet-plane at Sweden's main airport outside Stockholm which has been changed into a 25- room guesthouse that sleeps as many as 72 people.\n\"I learned about this plane that was standing deserted at Arlanda airport and I've been trying the concept of hostels in many different houses and buildings,\" he told Reuters. \"I thought, 'Why not a plane?'\"\nJumbo Hostels opened for business on Thursday, giving customers the chance to check in and sleep in a room that can best be described as comfortable.\"\n\"The most challenging part with this project is trying to build something inside a metal hull  - it's just really, really tight.\"\nThe jet, which was originally produced for Singapore Airlines, was taken out of service in 2002. It is held on a concrete foundation with the landing gear secured in steel cradles.\nOne feature of the hostel is its price - a room starts at 350 Swedish crowns (about $ 41), which is a lot less than hotel rooms outside of major airports.\nAnother feature is that customers can get married on the wing of the plane and stay in the plane's more luxurious honeymoon suite  .\nInstead of walking down the aisle in the church, lovebirds can take what Jumbo Hostels calls the \"wing walk,\" where they can be joined in great happiness at the wing tip. The hostel has someone ready to perform the ceremony.\nBut in some respects this hostel remains a plane - most customers have to share the jet's nine bathrooms and the staff only wear air host and hostess outfits. The only room that has its own bathroom is the honeymoon suite.", "id": "high22193.txt"}
