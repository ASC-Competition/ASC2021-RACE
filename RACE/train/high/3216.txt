This attractive career is for people who want a huge change of scenery and planet. The project is called the Hundred Years Starship, which aims to colonize   other lands such as the red planet Mars.\nSettlers would travel to the red planet and live there forever. NASA says it would be too expensive to bring humans back to Earth. The space agency can afford, however, to send supplies to the astronaut pioneers from Earth. Astronauts would be landed on the planet's surface and would never be able to return home due to the cost.\nNASA has started the project with $1.6 million, and hopes to attract investment from space-living billionaires. Google co-founder Larry Page told NASA he would be interested if the cost of a one-way ticket can go down from $10 billion to $2 billion.\nThe journey to Mars could take 4 months. Setting on the red planet would be extremely dangerous, especially given the freezing temperatures there. The thin atmosphere would be another problem as it is mostly carbon dioxide, so oxygen supplies are a must. A director in NASA said that he believed the trip might start with visiting Mars's moons first. He claimed that humans could be on Mars's moons by 2030.\nMany scientists think colonizing space is absolutely necessary. Steven Hawking believes we must move to other planets to survive as a species. He said: \"Once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe.\" Scientists Dirk' Schulze-Makuch and Paul Davies also call it a \"desirable goal\", though there surely are huge risks to explore new lands.", "id": "high3216.txt"}
