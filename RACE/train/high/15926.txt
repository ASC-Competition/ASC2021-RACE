It has vowed to make the city's water match its status as a world class city.\n\"The current tap water quality meets national standards, but, compared with that of the European Union and the United States, it still needs to be improved.\" said the SWA's director general, Hang Jiayi.\nIn other developed countries, water fountains can be found almost everywhere--people do not bother with bottled drinking water.\nBy 2020, the water of the Huangpu River will be treated to reduce the amount of organic waste in it. Major water works that draw water from the Huangpu will need more treatment facilities to improve the colour, texture, ammonia and nitrogen content before 2010.\nThese treatment facilities are expected to cost 4 billion yuan, something that could affect the price of water, according to Chen Yin, SWA's deputy director general.\nChen said that replacing water pipes was also a key project. The city's aged pipes are mostly to blame for the bad water quality.\nThe SWA has started the water facilities renovation work, including the more than 14,000 kilometres of indoor piping, 107,000 tanks on top of the buildings, and more than 6,000 underground facilities.\nWorld Water Day came on March 22, and this year's theme is \"Water for the future\". Beijing is also drawing up plans during China's Water Week, which runs until March 28.\nBy 2010, the water for the Shanghai EXPO is to be above World Health Organization standards. And, the people of Beijing will be able to drink their tap water as well.", "id": "high15926.txt"}
