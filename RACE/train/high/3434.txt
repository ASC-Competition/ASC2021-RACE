It can cost $1,000 to purchase \"screen reader\" software, but two blind computer programmers from Australia have solved this problem.\nQueensland University of Technology (QUT) graduate James Teh and business partner Michael Curran developed a free, open-source program, called NVDA, which provides a voice to read the words on a computer screen as the cursor  moves over them. NVDA won the blind inventors an award in the grand final program of the ABC's New Inventors, which aired on September 23. They took home the award for an invention that \"might make a real difference to people's lives or the environment.\"\n\"A sighted person takes for granted that they can sit down at any computer and use it,\" Mr Teh said. \"We really are in the information age -- everything is online these days. So access to computers for the blind is very important, which is why we wanted our software to be free.\"\nMr Teh, who majored in software engineering at QUT, said blind students typically didn't have the money to purchase \"screen reader\" technology, at the time in their life when they most needed it. Now NVDA could be downloaded on to anyone's personal computer free of charge.\n\"It can also be copied to a USB stick, which can be used on any PC at school or university, with no installation required,\" he said.\nMr Teh and Mr Curran have drawn on their own experience as blind computer users to develop a product which has some unique features. For example, as the mouse moves up and down the screen, a sound becomes higher and lower to let you know where the cursor is located.\nNVDA has been translated into 27 languages, thanks to volunteer translators. To date, there have been over 50,000 downloads.\nMr Teh and Mr Curran have been working on the project since 2006. They worked on their product without any pay for two years. When Mozilla offered some funding in 2008, Mr Teh was able to quit his day job and work full-time developing NVDA.", "id": "high3434.txt"}
