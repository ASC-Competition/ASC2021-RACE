No wonder gold prices have steadied after taking a dive.\nDuring the May Day holiday, gold stores were crowded with mostly female customers. Most of them are middle-aged \"Chinese housewives\". This group of buyers has risen to fame recently. They are big spenders and are desperate to get their hands on a bargain. \"I bought some gold jewellery and kept them as a gift for my son when he gets married,\" said a buyer from Shanghai.\nThe gold business is skyrocketing. \"Our sales are growing by the day.
