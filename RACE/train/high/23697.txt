Scientists have been collecting blood and tissue samples from the suffering bears, but they do not know the cause or the significance of the outbreak, the Anchorage Daily News reported.\n\"Our data set suggests that this is unusual but not unprecedented,\" DeGange said. Ten of 48 bears checked by the team in 1998-1999 had a similar condition, he said.\nIn a long-standing project, the USGS has sent polar bear research teams to the area since 1984. The teams track and examine the bears to help determine their general health and habits.\nThis year they saw their first bear with hair loss on March 21. The team will end up this year's operations in May when the sea ice becomes too dangerous for safe travel.\n\"We took biopsies   in 1999 and couldn't establish a causative agent for the hair loss then,\" DeGange said. \"But now we have this unexplained death event going on with seals  . And they haven't been successful in figuring out what caused the seal deaths. Is it just a matter of coincidence or is it related? We don't know.\"\nIn December 2012, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared an \"unusual death event\" based on a number of ringed seals found on beaches on the Arctic coast of Alaska during the summer. Dead and dying seals were found to have hair loss and skin sores.\nAffected seals were later observed in Canada and Russia.", "id": "high23697.txt"}
