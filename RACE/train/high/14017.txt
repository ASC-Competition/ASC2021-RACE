Encourage them to get moving and get off the couch  by giving them a pedometer . Pedometers are the most fun when parents also use one because that turns stepping, walking and running into a game to see who can get the most steps.\nThursday\nThe kids have done a great job so far this week, but now they long for a little more TV time. Instead of turning on cartoons, let them watch fitness movies made just for kids. These movies encourage watchers to get up and dance along to kid-friendly music.\nSaturday\nGet the whole family out of the house together and over to a park. Bring lots of sports equipment, pack a healthy picnic and have a family competitive sports day. Kids and adults get into groups and play against each other in tennis, basketball or soccer. After everyone has played hard for a couple of hours, stop for a picnic and then if your family isn't too tired, go back and play some more.\nSunday\nEvery child loves to play video games and there is no better time to allow kids to play them than on Sunday when no homework is due. But don't let them play a game that forces them to sit down for hours. Dance games with a floor mat  to help kids follow the dance moves are popular to kids.", "id": "high14017.txt"}
