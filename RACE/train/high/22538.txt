Putting down exact numbers is nearly impossible, but most experts agree that we are losing upwards of 80,000 acres of rainforests daily. Along with this loss and degradation  , we are losing some 135 plant, animal and insect species every day-- or some 50,000 species a year-- with the forests'fall.\n         According to researcher and writer Rhett Butler, tropical rainforests play a key role in the basic functioning of the planet. They help keep the climate normal by regulating atmospheric gases and rainfall.\n         Rainforests are also home to some 50 percent of the world's species, making them an outdoor biology library. Environmentalists also point out that a quarter of our modern  _ are got from the rainforest, but only less than one percent of the trees and plants in the tropics have been tested for curing diseases. Sadly, then, we don't really know the true value of what we're losing as we cut down and burn them.\n         Overall tropical degradation rates during the past 10 years are 8.5 percent higher than those during the 1990s. This figure is for all forests in the world's tropics, but researchers believe the loss of ancient rainforests has increased by as much as 25 percent.\n         Although the public is paying more attention to the importance of tropical rainforests, deforestation  rates are actually on the rise, mostly due to activities such as cutting, developing agriculture, animal raising, construction and mining. Indeed, as long as money-seekers are allowed to enter these areas, and as long as the population of poor people continues to increase, tropical rainforests will continue to be destroyed. We can not make the poor rich quickly, but we can at least stop businessmen setting foot on these areas through laws.", "id": "high22538.txt"}
