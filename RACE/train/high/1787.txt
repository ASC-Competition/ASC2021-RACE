With the protests developing from a group of young people's camping out near the New York Stock Exchange on September 17 to large-scale   movements across the country and around the world, people can't help asking: What has led to \"Occupy Wall Street?\"\nThree years after the severe economic crisis, the U.S. economy now is stuck again. Protesters are not satisfied with the present economic situation since unemployment rate is above 9 percent and economic growth has slowed. The housing market is still struggling for a recovery three years after the bubble   burst. People are losing their houses even after they have paid a large amount of mortgage . It is getting difficult for young people to find jobs. People feared that a similar crisis like the one in 2008 may be already on its way.\nIt is Wall Street that possessed the most riches. It is Wall Street greed that, at least partly, led to the financial crisis in 2008. It was Wall Street's \"fat cats\" who take taxpayers' aid money as their own big bonus  . With the growing economic crisis around the world, people realize that Wall Street is responsible for it. So they try to target people who created the crisis.\nThe majority of the protesters are young people under 30. Many of them are unemployed. Some are students with mountains of loans  . Some are hard-working people about to lose their houses even if they have paid a large amount of mortgage. They are complaining that the hard-working middle class is getting poor, yet Wall Street stays wealthy.\nWilliam Cohan, author ofMoney and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the world, wrote recently that Wall Street not only learned nothing from the 2008 crisis, they are also trying to kill all reforms that might \"break this dangerous cycle in which bankers get very rich while the rest of working people suffer from their mistakes.\"", "id": "high1787.txt"}
