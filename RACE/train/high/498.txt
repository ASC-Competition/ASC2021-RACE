They could wish for anything they wanted.\nThe man had just finished eating a piece of bread for his dinner, but he was still hungry. He said, \"I wish I had a big cake!\"\nSuddenly a cake appeared on his plate.\n\"You fool!\" His wife cried. \"You could have wished for a house full of wonderful food, but you wished for a cake. I wish that cake was on the end of your foolish nose! \"\nImmediately the cake stuck to the end of his nose.\nThen the man and his wife started blaming each other. \"It's your fault!\" the man cried. \"No, it's your fault!\" she answered. What could they do?
