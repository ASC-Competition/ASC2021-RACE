A New Jersey family was one of them. They lost their dog. He got away from their  backyard during the storm.\nChuck James said that his family searched for the brown-and-white dog named Reckless for  months after the October 2012 storm. Reckless was a cute dog which brought much pleasure to the  whole family, and the youngest daughter Tiffany loved him most. They played together, watched TV together, ate popcorn together and Reckless even saw Tiffany off when she headed for the kindergarten every morning. Chuck James kept searching for the lovely dog in every possible way, but no luck\n\"We reported him missing and called the shelters from time to time, just hoping they had  him,\" James said. \"We always kept our hopes up, but finally it was time to move on.\"\nJames said the family had planned to get a new dog. The dog was to be a tenth birthday surprise for their eldest daughter, Ally. The family of five went to the Monmouth County  SPCA( Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) to adopt a new animal. When James and his wife walked  close to the first cage, they saw a familiar face inside.\n\"He was a little bigger than I remembered because they had fed him well,\" James joked.  \"But then he was lying on my wife's feet and I knew it was him. It was unbelievable. I know this dog is meant to be with our family.\"\nWhen SPCA officials asked if they could prove the animal was their dog, a friend sent a _ showing the family, with their dog before Sandy hit the East Coast.\n\"We're all so happy to have him back.\" James said.  The family is living in hotel while their  home is being repaired. This weekend, the James went on camping trip with Reckless to celebrate the dog's return", "id": "high9819.txt"}
