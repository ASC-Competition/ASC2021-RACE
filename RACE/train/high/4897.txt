I do it day and night, averaging four hours of sleep. I can't control of this, and I don't know where to go for help. Do you?                            --Player\nA: Dear Player,\nYou have an addiction. For some people playing video games releases dopamine, a powerful brain chemical that makes you feel good. You'd toss your cigarettes if you were ready to quit, right? To kick the habit, get help from a health professional. And don't look for help on line; that would be like an alcoholic going to the bar for advice.\nQ: My brother's wife just had triplets . This is such a joy! Yet every time I share the news with co-workers, they ask me if she was on fertility pills. I think this is rude--or has society just become so talk-show numbed  that you can ask anyone anything?                     --No Show Host\nA: Dear Host,\nYes. Our society has become increasingly disrespectful of privacy. But don't blame it all on the talk-shows. Continue to celebrate and greet impolite questions with stony silence. Their fertility history is nobody's business but their own.\nQ: I work at an amusement park, and my manager steals supplies. She has a catering business on the side, and we've seen her load up her van at the back gates. The big bosses think she is the best thing since buttered bread, and we're all afraid that if we say anything, we'll lose our jobs. What can we do?    --Righteous\nA: Dear Righteous,\nBe sure you're right. You must have evidence about what and why things are going out the back gates. Once you know for certain, it's time to go to the bosses and report what you have seen.\nQ: My stepson's wife sometimes leaves their eight-year-old home alone for \"a short run to the store.\" That may be an hour or so. I believe by law we should report it. What do you think?\n--The In-laws\nA: Dear Laws,\nI don't know what the child-protection laws in your state are, but I do know that children need care and attention. This child may be able and unafraid, but kids aren't always careful. It also sounds like there is stress in your family relationship. One thing you can do to help this situation is offer to baby-sit when Mom needs to step out.", "id": "high4897.txt"}
