Those changes in behavior and activity may put animals at risk.\n\"When animals spend time in 'harmless' ways with humans, they may let down their guard,\" Blumstein said. As animals get used to feeling comfortable with humans, they may become braver in other situations, he says . \"If this bravery continues when they meet real predators , then they will die more often when they meet them.\"\nEco-tourism is in some ways similar to making animals live in human homes or in cities. In all three cases, regular interactions between people and animals tame. Evidence has shown that silver foxes that live with people become more laid-back and less fearful; this results from evolutionary changes but also from spending time with humans. Simply put , as Blumstein asked in the Scientific American magazine:\"Does eco-tourism make animals _ ?\"\nAnd that's not all - humans can also scare away natural predators , creating the so-called \"human shield effect\" and a safe environment for smaller animals that might make them braver, too. When humans are around, for example, vervet monkeys don't see as many leopards   trying to eat them.\nBlumstein says they hope to do more research into humans' interactions with wildlife. Scientists will \"now have to understand better how different species and species in different situations react to humans and when humans might put them at risk.", "id": "high12375.txt"}
