For the first part of the drive, I was thinking to myself how stupid I had been for not giving him my number.Then all of a sudden,when I had gone around a corner, I was completely over in another lane.There was no time to even hit the brakes.I hit at once.The police came and cut the top of my car off to get me out.They sent me to the hospital quickly.\nMy mother got there late that night,and saw me lying in the emergency room.The next morning,mom called the manager and told him what had happened and that I would be in the hospital for a long time.A few hours later,I received a phone call--it was the guy I hadn't given my number.Well,he came to visit me that night and the next night.We spent a lot of time together.\nIt was months before I would be walking and driving again,but he'd sit by me.I don't think I could have pulled through it without him.Now I can walk freely,and just this week we are planning on getting married one year after the day we met.It's just amazing how a tragedy like a car accident could bring about such a wonderful relationship!", "id": "high20395.txt"}
