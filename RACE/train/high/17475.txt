BBC producers Ros Smith and Kate Riley were invited to work with the schools.\nAfter deciding on their news topics, the students gathered vox pops from fellow students and their teachers.\nTiffany said, \"We had a chance to talk to other kids from other schools. This was great because Randfontein is a place which is not known to many people and away from modern civilization.\" Nomakhosi added, \"Interviewing our teachers and classmates was interesting and I felt important while doing this.\"\nChene commented, \"My voice sounded like a whole new person. It takes some time to get used to hearing your own voice.\"\nPupils, known as learners in South Africa, then worked with School Report producer Ros Smith to edit their audio  material while others started script-writhing .\nWith the 14:00 deadline fast approaching, and the audio edited, the new School Reporters recorded their scripts so they could be added to the bulletin.\nRos Smith was really impressed with the students' work. She said, \"The stories they chose were an excellent mix. The final bulletin sounds really good, and they finished with 10 minutes to spare before the deadline.\"\nOn 26 March students from the three schools took part in the School Report News Day with support from the Open Learning Systems Education Trust, and it was a big success.", "id": "high17475.txt"}
