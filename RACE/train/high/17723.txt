The boss was a hard man. He fired people who didn't do well without giving them a second chance.\n\"Watson,\" said Mr. Smith, \"this past year your department hasn't earned money. We're going to drop that department. It's finished. I'm sorry, --but you'll have to go.\" \"But, sir -- if I just had a little more time. For the moment I need the job to keep my son at Riverside School.\"\n\"What's that!\" said the boss. \"Riverside! I didn't know you had a boy there. That's an expensive school for a man with your salary.\"\n\"I know, sir. But he likes it there so much! He's a star athlete and the best boxer in the school. The boys call him Champ there.\"\nThe boss sat perfectly still for a long time -- a faraway   look in his eyes. Then, suddenly, he said, \"We've got to close your department, Watson. But you'll take over a new job in another department. It means longer hours--maybe more pay. Now get out. You're here for life.\"\nWatson got out, with surprise on his face. Then the boss took a letter from the top drawer of his desk. It was Herbie's last letter from Riverside School --written a few days before he died. He had read it over and over again with sick pain. The letter read:\nI can't say the boys here are any nicer to me than the others were. I guess it's the same everywhere when you're a cripple  . But don't worry about me, Dad. They've got a good chemistry department here. And there's one boy here who is really great. He's a track star and boxing champ   and just tops in chemistry. The boys call him Champ. He made them stop throwing my books around. And he knocked a boy down who hit me. He is the best friend I ever had. Dad, when I grow up, 1 want to do something for Champ. Something big -- that he won' t even know about.\nYour son, \nHerbie", "id": "high17723.txt"}
