In the US, where more than a quarter of all households consists of one person, single people often pay more insurance than married people. They don't get the same tax breaks and they seldom get promoted at work.\n              There seems to be a bad name attached to their status - somehow their personality is flawed\n  and therefore they are not to be trusted.\n              Activities have created the term \"singlism\" to describe discrimination against unmarried people.

In pop culture, singles are viewed as immature, whereas fully adults are able to form relationships and live meaningful lives.\n              The overall message is clear: go ahead and be yourself, but if you want real happiness, make sure you get coupled up.
