Since you've been away, has this country changed for the better or for the worse?\n    If you've just arrived back in the UK after a fortnight's holiday, small changes have probably surprised you--anything from a local greengrocer suddenly being replaced by a mobile-phone shop to someone in your street moving house.\nSo how have things changed to people coming back to Britain after seven, ten or even 15 years living abroad? What changes in society can they see that the rest of us have hardly noticed--or now take for granted? To find out, we asked some people who recently returned.\nDebi: When we left, Cheltenham, my home town, was a town of white, middle-class families--all very conservative  .The town is now home to many eastern Europeans and lots of Australians, who come here mainly to work in hotels and tourism. There are even several shops only for foreigners.\n    Having been an immigrant   myself, I admire people who go overseas to find a job. Maybe if I lived in an inner city where unemployment was high, I'd think differently, but I believe foreign settlers have improved this country because they're more open-minded and often work harder than the natives.\n    Christine: As we flew home over Britain, both of us remarked how green everything looked. But the differences between the place we'd left behind and the one we returned to were brought sharply into focus as soon as we landed.\nTo see policemen with guns in the airport for the first time was frightening -- in\nCyprus, they're very relaxed -- and I got pulled over by customs officers just for\ntaking a woolen sweater with some metal-made buttons out of my case in the arrivals\nhall. Everyone seemed to be on guard. Even the airport car-hire firm wanted a credit\ncard rather than cash because they said their vehicles had been used by bank robbers.\nBut anyway, this is still a green, beautiful country. I just wish more people would\nappreciate what they've got.", "id": "high17276.txt"}
