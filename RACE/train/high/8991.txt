But according to a new study, the famous sayingmight not be correct after all. A group of US scientists have found that the first impression we have of someone else is actually right most of the time.\nIn the study, scientists asked participants to look at a photograph of a person and make a quick judgment about him or her. A month later, the participant and the person in the photo were introduced, and scientists were shocked to find that their judgments oftenmatch those that they had made originally.\nIt's true that simply looking at someone won't provide you with as much information.But, according to scientists, when makinga first impression, people rely more on their instincts   than on logic  .\"They focus on how that person makes them feel,\" Paul Eastwick of the University of Texas told Live Science. \"It is very hard to get a sense of this information when simply viewing a profile .As soon as one sees another person, an impression is formed and what we see can sometimes _ what we know.\"\nOf course, no one can be right about everything and your instincts can go wrong sometimes. But even if it is proven to be wrong, once people form an opinion about someone, they have a hard time getting over that opinion later on.\nThe findings help explain why people always tidy themselves up before meeting guests or doing job interviews.\n\"Their face constantlyremindsus of that firstimpression,\" said Rule. People may learn more about another person over time once they get close to each other, but first impressions remain very important and seem difficult to forget.", "id": "high8991.txt"}
