Well, they're certainly not using the time for a moment of quiet thinking.Nor are they reading a book.New technology has replaced quiet habits.Today the only acceptable form of book on the London underground is an e-book.\nApple must earn a fortune from London commuters .Since the launch of the iPhone in 2007, over 40,000--yes, that's 40,000 \" _ \" have been designed.\nCommuters love them because they are the perfect time-fillers.One \"app\", called iShoot, is a game that features tanks.Another one, Tube Exits, tells passengers where to sit on the train to be closest to the exit of their destination.iSteam clouds the iPhone screen when you breathe into the microphone.You can then write in the \"steam\" on your phone screen.\nFor those without an iPhone, another Apple product, the iPod, may be the distraction of choice.It's not just teenagers who \"plug in\" to their music-iPods are a popular way to pass the time for all ages.\nAnd if games, e-books and music aren't enough to keep you occupied, then perhaps you would prefer a film? The development of palm DVD technology means many commuters watch their favorite TV shows or films on the way to work.With all these distractions, it's amazing that people still remember to get off the train.", "id": "high4251.txt"}
