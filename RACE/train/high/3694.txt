I hate that rubbish they play on the radio. They can't even understand a bit of music.\"\n\" I'm never playing in that club again. Too many drunks and nobody listens to us.\"\nBut a younger musician said, \"There are a few clubs that book my band a few nights a month, and I'm trying to find other places to play. I'm also looking to book a few summer festivals this year.\"\nI've heard that you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with, or to put it another way, you are who your friends are.\nAttitudes are important.

If you are around people who complain about lack of work and about other musicians, or blame others, and you play the role of victim  , chances are you will start as well.
