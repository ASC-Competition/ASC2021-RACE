So on Christmas morning he was thrilled to find the object of his desire under the tree, but there was a _ .\nThe phone came with an 18-point set of terms and conditions that he had to agree to before the phone could be his. And the agreement did not come from Apple or the phone provider, it was from his mother.\nHis mom, Janell Hoffman, included a contract along with the iphone that listed eighteen conditions or rules that Greg has to follow if he wants to keep it. Some of the rules limit the time he can use the phone; not after 7:30 p.m , and he can't take it to school. He also has to promise not to send \"hurtful\" text messages and e-mails to people; give his passwords to his parents, and always answer the phone when his mom or dad calls. Greg also has to use his own money to replace the phone if it's broken or lost\nJanell says the idea behind the contract is to teach her son to have a sense of responsibility and to learn to \"co-exist with technology, not be ruled by it'. She told him not to use this technology to lie, fool, or cheat another human being.\nMost of the terms do not just apply to the iphone, but to life. She also advised him to, \"keep your eyes up. See the world happening around you,\" \"Stare out a window. Listen to the birds. Take a walk. Talk to a stranger. Wonder without Googling.\"\n\"You are growing up in a fast and ever changing world. It is exciting and enticing. Trust your powerful mind and giant heart above any machine. I hope that you understand it is my job to raise you into a well rounded, healthy young man that can function in the world and coexist with technology, not be ruled by it,\"\n\"I love you. I hope you enjoy your awesome new iPhone. Merry Christmas!\"", "id": "high9958.txt"}
