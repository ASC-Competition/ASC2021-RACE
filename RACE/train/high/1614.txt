Because   _  ."], "article": "An Australian man who has been donating  his extremely rare kind of blood  for 56 years has saved the lives of more than two million babies.\nJames Harrison has an antibody  in his plasma  that stops babies dying from Rhesus disease, a form of severe anaemia . He has enabled countless mothers to give birth to healthy babies, including his own daughter, Tracey, who had a healthy son thanks to her father's blood.\nMr. Harrison has been giving blood every few weeks since he was 18 years old and has now racked up a total of 984 donations. When he started donating, his blood was deemed so special that his life was insured  for one million Australian dollars.\nHe was also nicknamed the \"man with the golden arm\" or the \"man in _ \". He said, \"I've never thought about stopping. Never!\" He made a pledge to be a donor aged 14 after undergoing major chest surgery in which he needed 13 liters of blood. \"I was in hospital for three months,\" he said. \"The blood I received saved my life so I made a pledge to give blood when I was 18.\"\nJust after he started donating he was found to have the rare  and life-saving antibody in his blood. At the time, thousands of babies in Australia were dying each year of Rhesus disease. Other newborns suffered permanent  brain damage because of the condition. _ . It stems from one having Rh-positive  blood and the other Rh-negative .\nHis blood has since led to the development of a vaccine called Anti-D. After his blood type was discovered, Mr. Harrison volunteered to undergo a series of tests to help develop the Anti-D vaccine. \"They insured me for a million dollars so I knew my wife Barbara would be taken care of,\" he said. \"I wasn't scared. I was glad to help. I had to sign every form going and basically sign my life away.\"\nMr. Harrison is Rh-negative and was given injections of Rh-positive blood. It was found his plasma could treat the condition and since then it has been given to hundreds of thousands of women. It has also been given to babies after they are born to stop them developing the disease.\nIt is estimated he has helped save 2.2 million babies so far. Mr. Harrison is still donating every few weeks now.", "id": "high1614.txt"}
