Gu was behind the camera for many of Zhang Yimou's famous films including the one that rocketed Zhang to fame: \"Red Sorghum  \". And now this master of the visual has taken on his first directing role with the film \"Peacock\". So Gu Changwei has come out from behind the camera into the spotlight  .\nGu Changwei is very serious about his directing \"Peacock\". To get the authentic atmosphere, Gu took his film crew to the city of Anyang in central China's Henan province where the story takes place, to shoot the film. He chose all new actors because he didn't want \"star\" appeal to weaken the power of the story, and he also had his actors trained in the local dialect. For this film Gu has been able to get out from behind the camera to manage every aspect of the film, and to realize his own ideals in movie-making.\n\"Peacock\" is about the life of an average family in a small town in Henan province in the late 70s and early 80s. Gu chose this story for his first movie because he grew up during this same period and it struck a chord with him.\n\"Peacock\" wrapped up production in June, 2004. It's aimed at the foreign film market and will be entered in February's Berlin Film Festival, and released in China at the same time. But at the end of last October, Gu took \"Peacock\" to his Alma Mater, the Beijing Film Academy, one of the most famous film colleges in China, to hold a preview. The film was warmly received by both teachers and students.", "id": "high15931.txt"}
