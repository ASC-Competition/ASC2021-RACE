Besides, it uses a voice to tell you where the fire is.\nThe alarm is the first UK product from Nest, which is run by iPod-inventor Tony Fadell. The company claims the device's batteries will last for up to seven years. The device will offer a spoken warning before it sounds a major alarm. Also it will use text messages and apps on your phones to alert users to low-level risks.\nThe present smoke alarms constantly alert users to non-existent threats, which will make many users annoyed and finally remove their batteries altogether. \"We've all experienced the smoke alarm going off while we're cooking. Sometimes, we need to search for the source of that non-stop low-battery chirp at midnight,\" said Fadell. \"Therefore, every time a smoke alarm cries wolf, we trust it a little less, and then -- in a moment of frustration -- we take the batteries out to stop the beep . And that leaves us and our families at risk.\"\nIf the Protect smoke alarms are used, they can be set up in up to ten zones, so that the clear warnings tell users where the risk has been detected.\n\"Safety shouldn't be annoying,\" said Matt Rogers, Nest founder and vice president of engineering. \"It was unacceptable to us that one in eight houses in the UK has a non-functioning smoke alarm. These products are required by law and are supposed to keep us safe, yet people hate them. We wanted to change that.\"", "id": "high6619.txt"}
