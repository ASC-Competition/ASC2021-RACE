The doctor willingly came to see the woman and to do what he could for her, but before he went into the house, he made a short stop. He knew that the lawyer was famous for not paying his bills, even if they were due .He therefore said to the man.\"But if I save your wife, I am afraid you may not pay me.\"\n\"Sir,\"replied the lawyer. \"Here I have$500,,whether you cure my wife or you kill her. I'll give you all this.\"\nThe doctor was reassured  and went into the house. When he reached the woman's bedside, it soon became clear to him that he could do little. She was seriously ill, and though he prescribed  her medicine, she soon died.\nHe told the lawyer he was very sorry, and then asked for the money which he had promised. \"Did you kill my wife?\"asked the lawyer. \"Of course I didn't,\" said the doctor. \"Well! Did you cure my wife?\" asked the man. \"I'm afraid that was impossible,\" replied the doctor.\"Well, then since you neither killed my wife nor cured her, I have nothing to pay you.\"", "id": "high5259.txt"}
