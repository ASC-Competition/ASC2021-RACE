So-called green schools are built from recycled and environmentally friendly materials. They are designed to use less energy than traditional school buildings. In the next few years, Southern California alone plans to open 150 green schools. Studies have shown that there are good reasons to go green, including good air quality that cuts down on asthma attacks and airborne germs that can cause illnesses. Students learn better in classrooms that have natural light and ideal temperatures. Green schools have lower energy bills. Go On, Get Green\n     Here's how to save energy and help the environment. \nLight Savers\n     Turn off the lights in a room when it is not in use. This bright idea can produce big savings on energy costs. Some schools use sensors that automatically shut off the lights when there is no motion in a room. \nHeat Smart\n     Your school's thermostat should be set to 78degCin warm weather and 68degCin cooler weather. The temperature can be even farther from the comfort zone at night and on weekends, when no one is using the school building.\n Reuse, Recycle\n     Reuse paper, cans, bottles and batteries. Use both sides of notebook paper. Carry a lunch box rather than a paper bag. Recycle whatever you can reuse. \nDon't Drip \n     Leaky taps can waste large amounts of water. A small, steady flow can add up to hundreds of gallons a year. Report drips if you see them.", "id": "high9537.txt"}
