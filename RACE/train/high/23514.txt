They fell at speeds reaching 140mph, past the highest ridges of the snow-covering Himalayas, before each released a parachute  . The jumpers wore oxygen masks to keep their lungs working as they fell. Wearing neoprene underwear  was compulsory -- to prevent them from being frozen to death.\nThe adventure, advertised by its organizers as \"a feast for those who seek to stimulate all their senses to the full\", appeared to have lived up to its billing. \"I had never seen so many mountains before,\" Ms Smith said. \"To be on top of the world was simply stunning .\"\nThe expedition also offered a way by which to celebrate her 30th birthday later this month, she said. Besides, her jump raised funds for charities in Britain and Nepal, including more than PS10,000 for the Hampshire Autistic Society.\nIn the next few days the feat will be repeated by about 30 others, weather permitting. Each has paid at least PS12,675 to High and Wild, the British adventure travel company behind the project. Ms Budge said: \"It was worth the money. It is something that has never been done before.\"", "id": "high23514.txt"}
