We could not visit the city since it was completely blocked off, so instead we travelled around before going to Japan.\"\nBut days after the Svanstroms arrived, Tokyo was rocked by Japan's largest earthquake since records began.\n\"The trembling was horrible and we saw roof tiles fly off the buildings,\" Mr. Svanstrom said. \"It was like the buildings were swaying back and forth.\"\nThe family returned to Stockholm on March 29 after a much calmer visit to their last destination China.\nBut Mr. Svanstrom --- who also survived the destructive Boxing Day tsunami that hit southeast Asia in 2004 --- said the marriage was still going strong.\nHe added, \"I know marriages have to experience some difficulties, but I think we have been through most of them. We've certainly experienced more than our fair share of disasters, but the most important thing is that we're together and happy.\"", "id": "high7128.txt"}
