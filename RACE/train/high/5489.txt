As I was finishing my meal, an elderly couple came in to dine. They were holding hands and had lovely smiles on their faces. They sat three tables from me. I was amazed at the love they showed for each other. It seemed to strike home all the more, because it was shortly after ending a 20-year marriage and I still had pain in my heart.\nMy waiter was also their waiter. As I paid my bill, I inquired as to what their bill was. He informed me, and I gave him $40 to pay their bill.  He asked if I knew them and I told him \"No, I just wanted to repay them for the love that they were showing to each other,\" and then I departed.\nThe next day I entered the restaurant to dine before my departure. After I had been seated, the waiter who served me the night before told me that the strangest thing happened after I left the restaurant.\nWhen the elderly couple went to pay for their meal, they were informed that it had been paid. When they inquired who had done this, the hostess told them they had no idea who I was, just retelling what I said.\nThe couple were amazed. They looked around, asked for the bill of two young couples who were seated together, paid their bill and departed, saying \"Love begets  Love\" to the amazement of the hostess and waiter.\nI smiled and said \"That's nice,\" and proceeded to order my meal.\nAbout 45 minutes later, I finished my meal and was about to head out, but my waiter was nowhere to be found. I waited and waited and finally walked over to the hostess stand and explained that I needed to pay for my meal and hurry to the airport. She smiled and explained that I would not have to pay for my meal, because both the waiter and she felt compelled to pay my bill due to the joy that was brought to the faces of the elderly couple and the amazement of the young couples.\nWhen I told her that they didn't have to do that, she said with a smile \"Love begets Love.\"", "id": "high5489.txt"}
