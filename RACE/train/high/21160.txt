In spite of the most painstaking research, no one has yet found the answer.One explanation offered by scientists is that people tend to stay together indoors more in cold weather than at other times, and this makes it easier for cold viruses to be passed on.\n       No one has yet found a cure for the cold.There are drugs and pain suppressors such as aspirin, but all they do is to relieve the symptoms.", "id": "high21160.txt"}
