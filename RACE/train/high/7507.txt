The children who slept longer, although they woke up more frequently during the night, scored higher on tests, Sadeh reported in the March/April issue of journal Child Development.\n\"When the children slept longer, their sleep quality was somewhat weak, but in spite of this their performance for study improved because the extra sleep was more significant than the reduction in sleep quality. \" Sadeh said. \"Some studies suggested that lack of sleep as a child affects development into adulthood and it's more likely to develop their attention disorder when they grow older. \"\nIn earlier studies, Sadeh's team found that fourth graders slept an average of 8. 2 hours and sixth graders slept an average of 7. 7 hours.\n\"Previous research has shown children in elementary school need at least nine hours of sleep a night on a regular basis, said Carl Hunt, director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research in Bethesda, and high-school-age children need somewhat less, he said, adding the results of insufficient sleep could be serious.\n\"A tired child is an accident waiting to happen,\" Hunt said. \"And as kids get older, toys get bigger and the risks higher. \"Hunt also said too little sleep could result in learning and memory problems and long-term effects on school performance.\n\"This is an important extension of what we already know, \" Hunt said of Sadeh's research, adding sleep is as important as nutrition  and exercise to good health.\n\"To put it into reality,\" Hunt said, \"parents should make sure they know when their children actually are going to sleep and their rooms are conducive to sleeping instead of playing. \"", "id": "high7507.txt"}
