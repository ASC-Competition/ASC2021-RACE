The sign said:\"Yesterday the person who has been hindering   your growth in this company passed away. We invite you to join the funeral  in the room that has been prepared in the gym.\"\nAt first everyone was sad to hear that one of their colleagues had died,but after a while they started getting curious about who this person might be.\nThe excitement grew as the employees arrived at the gym to pay their last respects. Everyone wondered:\"Who is this person that was hindering my progress? Well,at least he's no longer here.\"\nOne by one the employees got closer to the coffin  and when they looked inside it they became speechless. They stood over the coffin,shocked and in silence,as if someone had touched the deepest part of their soul.\nThere was a mirror inside the coffin:Everyone who looked inside it could see himself. There was also a sign next to the mirror that said. \"There is only one person who can set limits to your growth:it is YOU.\"\nYou are the only person who can revolutionize  your life. You are the only person who can influence your happiness,your realization and your success. You are the only person who can help yourself.\nYour life does not change when your family changes,when your friends change,when your boss changes,and when your company changes.\nYour life changes when YOU change,when you go beyond your limiting beliefs,when you realize that you are the only one responsible for your life.", "id": "high8295.txt"}
