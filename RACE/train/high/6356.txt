The walls would not shelter towns, he said, but instead would soften the streams of hot southern and cold northern air that form tornadoes when they clash in the first place.\nBut critics laughed at Tao's proposals. Leading tornado experts pointed to areas that are already protected by hill ranges the size of the barriers Tao is proposing, yet still have plenty of tornados, like parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri. And even if the plan did work, it would create more problems than it would solve, scientists said, by creating catastrophic weather side effects.\n\"Everybody I know is of 100% agreement - this is a poorly conceived idea,\" Professor Joshua Wurman of the Center for Severe Weather Research. \"From what I can gather his concept of how tornadoes form is fundamentally flawed . Meteorologists  cringe  when they hear about 'clashing  hot and cold air'. It's a lot more complicated than that.\"", "id": "high6356.txt"}
