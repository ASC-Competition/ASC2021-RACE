NBA superstar Tracy McCray watches from a distance before offering to buy the kids a grass pitch for $1. 000. \nPerhaps he sees a Ronaldinho rising up out of the African soil. Or maybe he just wants to do something -- anything -- to give these children some hope. But he is told, politely, that grass is not what the kids need. \nThis scene appears in 3 Point, a new documentary , which shows the Houston Rockets star coming face to face with the reality that life is more than sport. \nMcGrady,29, writes on his website that he traveled to Africa because he was tired of only reading about it in news. \"Who were the faces behind the numbers?\" He said. \"I needed to see it for myself. \nAnd he did. He stepped out of his large house and flew to a place torn to bits by war and famine . He slept in a tent. He kept away from minefields. He talked with people who have been suffering. And he swallowed his pride. \nBut no one should blame McGrady for wanting to buy the kids a pitch of grass. Sports gave him a chance, so perhaps he thought it would do the same for the refugees. \nMcGrady was  _ by NBA managers as a teenager and he didn't bother going to college.\nInstead, he leaped right into the NBA. Since that move, basketball has given him a handsome living, but one very far removed from the lives of ordinary people.\nAs McGrady would learn in Africa, most people see sports as just a break from life's difficulties. They don't mistake it for 1ife itself. \nOnly McGrady knows how this Africa trip changed him, but I'd bet that, at the very least, it has given him a new sense for what is truly meaningful. \nMcGrady doesn't own an NBA championship ring. He hasn't risen to the heights of Kobe Bryant or Michael Jordan. \nBut, perhaps, now he knows he doesn't have to in order to truly make a difference in the world.", "id": "high16780.txt"}
