It doesn't disturb the water as it waits for its meal, and there is barely a ripple  when it skims  across the surface at lightning speed to catch its prey.\nGrass water spiders deal swiftly with larger insects like damsel flies by pulling their heads under the water and holding them there until they drown.\nAfter a meal, the grass water spider spends up to half an hour grooming  itself. It wipes its eight eyes, brushes its antennae , and takes special care to clean the hairs on its body.\nIt is the hairs that trap tiny bubbles  of air so that the spider can run down a blade  of grass and stay underwater for up to an hour when it is frightened. The hairs also keep the spider dry, even underwater.\nIt is only when the female spider is caring for the young that she does not hunt on the water. After mating, she produces a large egg sac , which she carries around for five weeks. Once the eggs start to hatch, she attaches the sac to some blades of grass or a thistle. She then tears the sac open and releases the tiny spiders into the nursery web.", "id": "high19045.txt"}
