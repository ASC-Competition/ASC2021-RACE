It doesn't feel like long since I crossed it first.\"\nMike set off on his round-the-world trip on November 18, 2008. He has been sailing his yacht, TotallyMoney.com, single-handedly, though a support team has been sailing next to him along the way. ks5u\nThe teen has now achieved the title of Youngest Sailor to Circumnavigate the Globe Solo, according to the Guinness World Records.\nMike learned how to sail when he was seven years old from his father, Peter and at age 14, he sailed across the Atlantic alone.\nThe teenager's school -- which Mike describes as \"highly supportive\" of his trip -- has redesigned his coursework to fit in with his trip. It also gave him some coursework to do during \"quiet moments,\" according to Mike's Website.\nThere haven't been many of those quiet moments. Repeated autopilot failures forced him to stop for repairs in Portugal, the Canary Islands, South Africa, and twice in Australia, according to his Web site.\nBad weather in the Southern Ocean -- between Australia and Antarctica -- forced Mike to battle 50ft waves and 57 mph winds. He said at one point, a \"freak wave\" picked up the boat and turned it on its side.  \"My feet were on the ceiling at the time,\" he told CNN. \"That was a really hairy moment, and I was certainly thinking, 'Why am I here?' But we took the sails off and the day after I thought, 'This is brilliant!'\"\nMike describes his father as his biggest hero, always supportive of what he wanted to achieve. Peter Perham said he wasn't too worried about his son facing dangerous situations at sea, as long as he knew what to do and stayed safe.", "id": "high22533.txt"}
