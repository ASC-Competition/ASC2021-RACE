I wanted to continue to be a donor and asked around if there was a Red Cross clinic in Beijing. There was one, and I went. I was very surprised to be received as a hero; for me, a blood donation was simply a good habit and a gift of love to Humanity.\nIn Canada, donors can give 450ml each time every 51 days. That means six times a year. In China, we can give only 200ml, every four months.\nIn 1984, there were only 19 donors in Beijing who offered their blood for free. One year later, there were 141. In 1986, 1,083, and so on until the figure reached 10,046 in 1990,14,016 in 1992 and more than double that the following year. There were 41,037 in 1994, and my statistics stop here. I'm so glad to see that the Chinese have understood that giving blood is not dangerous, and that it's a way to say, in a real communist spirit, \"brother, I love you\".\nIn fact, every time I give blood, I think of my blood running in a man or a woman's veins, someone who has become my brother or my sister through a transfusion. Thirteen Chinese have become my  s now; isn't that great? Giving blood is like giving birth. Some of these thirteen people may have died without my donation; doesn't that make it worth becoming a volunteer? What makes me even happier is when I can convince a Chinese friend to come with me and become a donor too.", "id": "high21749.txt"}
