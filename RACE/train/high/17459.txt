On the other hand,Iceland,which is Greenland's  ly near neighbor to the east,is much greener.\nWhy is this?Iceland is far enough north,like Greenland,to be entirely covered by ice,but more than one third of Iceland is volcanically active.Magma,which is molten volcanic rock below the surface of the ground,heats the terrain above it,keeping it green.The story goes that an early settler from Iceland gave Greenland its name in order to encourage more people to live there!\nEven the smallest islands have a story to tell.The remotest inhabited island in the world is Tristan da Cunha,which is in the South Atlantic Ocean.Fewer than 250 people live there and they are all related to each other,with only seven surnames between them.The island capital has the romantic name of Edinburgh of the South Seas.", "id": "high17459.txt"}
