But just a few days ago, it took the life of a pop singer in China. Wang Bei, 24, a former singer on Super Girl, died on Nov 15 during plastic surgery in Wuhan, Hubei province. The young singer's jaw suddenly started bleeding during the procedure, blocking her throat and causing her to suffocate.\nThe Ministry of Health stepped in on Nov 27, calling on health authorities all over China to increase supervision of the country's medical plastic surgery industry. It also told the Hubei health department to look into Wang's death and \"to make the results of the investigation public as soon as possible\"\nWang's death has raised concerns about the dangers of plastic surgery in China. In China, people, especially youngsters, are becoming more and more conscious of their looks and are willing to _ to make themselves look more attractive. Today, many young people see plastic surgery as the key to love, wealth and success.\nDing Xiaobang, a plastic surgeon at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said that in the past decade, he had seen a growing number of patients, like Wang Bei, who were young and naturally good-looking. \"They want to improve their appearance to find better opportunities in work and in marriage,\" said Ding.\nZhao, 23, a student at the Beijing International Studies University, spent 3,000 yuan on a eyelid tuck before graduating this year. She said: \" Of course I want to look prettier. I want to make a good impression on potential employers.\"\nDing also owed this trend to frustration. \"Some are frustrated with life and use surgery as a way to try and recover,\" said Ding.\nBut a lot of people ignore the risk and danger of plastic surgery. In 12 years as a doctor, Zhu Wenbo from Chengdu has often seen unsuccessful plastic surgeries.\" I've met several people whose faces were ruined by plastic surgery, and helping them recover is difficult,\" said Zhu.\nBeing yourself is the most beautiful thing in the world. But if you are considering plastic surgery, here is some advice from experts:\n1. Choose qualified hospitals, especially those with a good reputation for plastic surgery. Avoid beauty salons.\n2. Do not expect too much from changing your appearance. It can only change your face or another body part in certain ways. And safety should always come first.", "id": "high8945.txt"}
