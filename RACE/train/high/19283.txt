Some dolphins made it. About 24 died.\nFor 35 dolphins in danger there was only one chance for survival--to be sent to the Marine Mammals Care Centre.\nThe dolphins were placed in a water pool where they have been given care  _ by hundreds of volunteers who signed up for four-hour shifts  . By the second week in April, only 11 of the original 35 were still alive.\nEach year thousands of dolphins, the lovely marine mammals, are found beached or stranded   along coastlines around the world. They can't get back to the sea and will die if they don't get help, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society's website.\nNobody knows what caused the dolphins to strand themselves, but the US Navy and marine wildlife experts are investigating whether the dolphin stranding was caused by sonar   exercises of ships. And some scientists suggest disease, or human interference  . The reason for stranding isn't completely understood.\nIn the pool, volunteers hold the dolphins and keep their blowholes out of the water so they can breathe. A vet injects the mammals with vitamin E to help with muscle cramping  . Unable to eat on their own, they are fitted with a feeding tube to get them the needed nutrition.\n\"Today we made the first steps in getting them to eat dead fish and to eat them out of our hands,\" Banick said. It's a race against time and feeding times must be strictly kept to.", "id": "high19283.txt"}
