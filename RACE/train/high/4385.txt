I had made just one small change. But it's not that I hadn't been warned. My colleagues had said he was responsible for the resignations of the two previous secretaries. As the weeks went by, I came to look down on Jack.\nAfter another of his episodes had left me in tears I stormed into his office. \"what?\" he said suddenly. \"Jack, the way you've been treating me is wrong. I've never had anyone speak to me that way. As a professional, it's wrong for me to allow it to continue,\" I said. Jack smiled nervously, \"Susan, I make you a promise that I will be a friend. I will treat you as you deserve to be treated, with respect and kindness.\"\nJack avoided me the rest of the week, and never questioned my work again. I brought cookies to the office one day and left some on his desk. Another day I left a note: \"Hope your day is going great. \" Over the next few weeks, there were no more Jack episodes. One year later\nI discovered I had breast cancer, and was scared. The statistics were not great for my long-term survival.\nOne day, however, Jack visited me in the hospital and silently handed me a bundle with several bulbs inside. \"Tulips ,\" he said. I smiled, not understanding. \"If you plant them when you get home, they'll come up next spring. I think you will be there to see them when they come up. Next spring you will see the colours I picked out for you.\" Tears clouded my eyes and he left. I have seen those red and white striped  tulips push through the soil every spring for over ten years now. This past September the doctor declared me cured. At a moment when I was praying for just the right word, a man with very few words said all the right things. After all, that's what friends do.", "id": "high4385.txt"}
