A study shows that about two-thirds of typical Chinese Internet users use the computer for news, often entertainment-related, or for online games, music or movies, all can be downloaded for free. Most prefers messages to e-mail, seldom makes online shopping at all.\nAlthough they are now depending on the Internet more often than before to communicate with others who have the same professions, hobbies and political interests, online shopping still remains unpopular in China. Three-quarters of users surveyed have never bought anything over the Internet, and only 10 percent do shopping even once a month. Among those who do buy online, most pay for entertainment while others buy phone cards, or computer hardware or software.\n\"Many people don't trust the quality of goods bought online,\" the researcher said, \"If they buy it in a store and don't like it, they can easily bring it back.\"\nThe survey was done in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Changsha. Results do not necessarily project countrywide because Internet use in the countryside is lower than in cities. The study showed that the typical netizens   in the five cities are richer and more highly educated. Males make up two-thirds of the group, and more than 80 percent of users are under 24.Surprisingly, with the ages increase, the percentage decreases.\nChina has more than 200 million people online, however, forty-two percent say they do not use search engines. Others seek entertainment news, as well as information useful for work or study on line. Baidu. com was used by half of those surveyed, compared with a quarter for Google, the leading search engine in the United States.", "id": "high22864.txt"}
