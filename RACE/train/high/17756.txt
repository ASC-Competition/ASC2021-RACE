This makes for an interesting approach to motivating book buyers to read books more quickly, giving first-time authors the attention they need to survive.\n   \"The Book That Can't Wait\" tackles an important problem for new authors: How to get readers. The creative independent publishers teamed up with DRAFTFCB in the city of Buenos Aires to develop this project. \n   \"Books are very patient objects. We buy them, and then they wait for us to read them. Days, months, even years. That's OK for books, but not for new authors. If people don't read their first book, they'll never make it to a second,\" says the project coordinator Tito Santana.\n   That's why Etema Cadencia, which also runs its own bookstore, has decided to create something different to launch its new authors into the market. It presented its first \"The Book That Can't Wait\" for the critics and the press last month. The invention is a success. Hundreds of people came to the bookstore to pick up a copy. To help spread the word, they gave away the first edition to customers for free. The very same day it was released, the publishing house claimed that it received thousands of requests for more copies of the book. So it will print a new edition later this month to satisfy the demand. And the best result? This time they have the guarantee that their new authors will be read. The company plans to use the book as a platform for other titles, because they believe there is a lot of literature out there that doesn't deserve to wait on the shelf. And these books won't wait at all.", "id": "high17756.txt"}
