He asked his father, \"Why does my apple turn brown?\" his father answered, \"When the skin is removed, air reaches the flesh of the apple and causes oxidation. This changes the apple's molecular structure and results in a brownish color.\" The boy asked, \" Daddy, what are you talking about?\"\nI know how that boy feels. Sometimes I want answers to some of those confusing questions that we all meet with, such as how to get through difficult times or what to do in a tough situation. I just want to get it right.\nThe problem is that I don't always have the answer I need. Nobody else seems to have them, either. So I go on making mistakes and think that I'll never get it right.\nOften I didn't know what to do. I often made poor choices, but I gradually improved. Then I realized that I don't HAVE TO always get it right. I don't have to always know what to do all the time. All I really need to do is try my best, learn from my mistakes and go on.\nDr. Leo Buscaglia once said, \" No one gets out of this world alive, so the time to live, learn, care, share, celebrate and love is now. That would be pretty hard to do when you're waiting for all the answers first.\"\nSo you got it wrong. You made a mistake. So what should you do next? Forgive yourself and try again. You may not get out of this world alive, but you can get plenty of life out of this world if you are not too worried about always getting it right.", "id": "high2019.txt"}
