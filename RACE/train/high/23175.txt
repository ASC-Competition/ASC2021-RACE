Being identical, the twins had identical brains at birth, and their growth, processes were the same, When the twins were three months old, their parents.died, and they were placed in separate foster homes, Peter was reared by parents of low intelligence in an isolated community with poor educational opportunities, Mark was reared in the home of well-to -do parents who had been to college ,He was read to as a child, sent to good schools, and given every opportunity to be stimulated  intellectually, This environmental difference continued until the twins were in their late teens, when they were given tests to measure their intelligence, , Mark's LQ ,was 125.twenty-five points higher than the average and fully points higher than his identical brother Given equal opportunities, the twins, having identical brains , would have tested at roughly the same level", "id": "high23175.txt"}
