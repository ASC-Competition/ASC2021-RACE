Have you found that you don't know how to make friends? Don't worry. It's easier than it looks.\nStart with small actions. If you're uncomfortable with long conversations with people, start by just saying \"hi\" and asking what the person is doing. Even if you do more listening than talking in the beginning, people will usually still like you. When it comes to conversations, remember \"F.O.R.\". It stands for family, occupation  and recreation . You are most likely to be asked about these three topics when you meet someone new. Most people feel comfortable talking about the three topics. The great thing is that you also can communicate with someone new in these three areas.\nHonesty is the best policy. In friendship, \"honesty\" is the fundamental quality that one must have. One should always be honest with his or her friends. Don't laugh at people's fault. Praise them honestly and openly. Say you are sorry if you hurt your friend.\nGive more than you take.
