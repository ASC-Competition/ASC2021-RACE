At last, the traffic was moving. She swung quickly racing to her house. As she opened the door , she nearly tripped over  Sheba.\n\"Hey, Sheba,\" she said, \"I've got no time for you now, but I'll take you out as soon as I get back from tennis club.\" Then she noticed Sheba seemed to be coughing or choking. Obviously, she could hardly breathe. Immediately, Joanne realized she would have to take her to the vet  .\nWhen she got there, the vet was just about to close for the day. Seeing the state of Sheba, Dr. Sterne brought her quickly into his office.\n\"Listen, doctor, I'm really in a rush to get to a meeting, can I leave her with you, and go and get changed? I'll be back in ten minutes to pick her up, and then I'll take her on to the meeting with me. Is that OK?\"\n\"Sure.\" said the doctor.\nJoanne made the quick trip back to her house in a couple of minutes. As she was once more entering the hallway, the phone by the door began to ring.\n\"This is Dr. Sterne,\" said an anxious voice. \"I want you to get out of that house immediately, \"said the doctor's voice. \"I'm coming round right away, and the police will be there any time now. Wait outside!\"\nAt that moment, a police car screeched  to a stop outside the house. Two policemen got out and ran into the house. Joanne was by now completely confused and very frightened. Then the doctor arrived.\n\"Where's Sheba? Is she OK?\" shouted Joanne.\n\"She's fine, Joanne. I took out the thing which was choking her, and she's OK now. \"\nJust then, the two policemen reappeared from the house, half-carrying a white--faced man, who could hardly walk. There was blood all over him.\n\"My God, \" said Joanne, \"how did he get in there? And how did you know he was there?\"\n\"I think he must be a burglar.\" said the doctor. \"I knew he was there because when I finally removed what was stuck in Sheba's throat:it turned out to be three human fingers.\"", "id": "high2041.txt"}
