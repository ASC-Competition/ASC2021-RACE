Jeffrey spent most summers of his youth working with his grandfather on their farm.\nJeffrey showed intense and varied scientific interests at an early age. He set up an electric alarm to keep his younger sisters and brothers out of his room and changed his parents' garage into a laboratory for his science projects.\nAfter he graduated from Princeton University with a degree in computer science and electrical engineering, Jeffrey Bezos found employment on Wall Street, where computer science was increasingly in demand to study market trends.

In 2008, he was selected byU.S. News & World Reportas one of America's Best Leaders. Bezos' Amazon has become \"the Earth's biggest anything store\". Amazon.com is now called \"one of the smartest strategies in business history\".\nToday, Jeffrey Bezos lives north of Seattle and is increasingly concerned with charity activities. \"Giving away money takes as much attention as building a successful company,\" he said.", "id": "high1586.txt"}
