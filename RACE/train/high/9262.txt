The bird then drops small stones into it until the water level rises enough for the bird to drink.\n\"Oh, it's just a fable,\" you may think. After all, it's hard to imagine birds knowing about \"problem solving\".\nBut new research has found that crows' brains may sometimes be better than those of 6-year-old children.\nIn a recent experiment, US scientist Corina Logan and her team caught six crows to test them. There were two tubes   of water, one wide and the other narrow  . Each crow was given four stones, enough to help them get the water in the narrow tube, but not the wide one.\nSurprisingly, the crows dropped all or most of the stones into the narrower tube and got the food reward! They had found out the cause-and-effect relationship.Using such brains, crows are making their lives easier. For example, some crows in cities have learned to use road traffic for breaking nuts, National Geographic News reported.\nBut how are their wits   compared to humans'? Logan's team did another experiment, this time on both crows and children.\nHere, the crows and children had to choose between two sets of tubes.\nWith the red set, when they dropped a stone into a wide tube, the water level raised in a connected narrow tube that contained food.\nThe blue set of tubes, however, had no connection between them. So dropping a stone in the wide tube did not cause the water level to rise in the narrow tube.\nChildren aged 7 to 10 were able to learn the rule. Children aged 4 to 6, however, failed.\nFive of the six crows failed the test. But Kitty, a 6-month-old crow, passed it. She put all or most of the stones into the red tube.\nSo, could a bird be more clever than a kindergartner? Don't be too quick to say no.", "id": "high9262.txt"}
