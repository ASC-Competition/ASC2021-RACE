Mean old ladies\nThere is always a reason why an old lady gives you a serious look - you are being too loud, dressed improperly or not crossing the street in the right place. Sometimes it can be lovely, but if you are already having a bad day, a mean old lady can drive you mad.\nWhat to do about it:\nI've come to realize that when people start conflicts, it is actually an expression of their inner state expressed in an outside way. You, your personality, your looks or your actions have nothing to do with it. It is not personal, so why take it personally?\n2. That person, who cuts in front of everybody in line\nThis is something that gets me angry. Even if I am not in a hurry, I still feel bad for the other people in line who are being treated unjustly. Are you more patient than I am or do you feel annoying too?\nWhat to do about it:\nIf we have negative thoughts then we are wasting our energy on negativity. Situations like this could be a great opportunity to learn to control our first negative responses and practice understanding. After all, the person may just have a quick question or maybe there is an emergency.\nFriends that tell you \"I told you so\"\nIt is one thing to admit that you made a mistake and another to hear it from a friend. Friends should be there to support you and cheer you up when you are feeling down, not make themselves feel better at your expense, right?\nWhat to do about it:\nIt helps to remember that when people say \"I told you so\", they may mean, \"Please listen to my advice to avoid future mistakes.\" If this is not the help you need - voice it out, without getting defensive.", "id": "high5950.txt"}
