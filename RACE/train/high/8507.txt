We asked top scientists to share their predictions on what the world will be like in a century. If they're right, the 2114 is going to be really cool.\n1. Robots will do your chores and more\nRobots will be doing most of our jobs, from building homes to teaching math. There are already robots that clean floors and pump gas. In the future they will be more complicated and useful. Unfortunately, with robots taking all the jobs, unemployment will be high.\n2. You will read minds.\nSpeaking of being social, we will communicate in an entirely different way. Forget texts and emails. Mind-reading technology will allow us to send thoughts to each other without speaking a word. We will also be able to send thoughts to objects around us. (Instead of pressing \"start\" on the microwave, you could just think \"start.\") Meanwhile, chips implanted(in our brains will improve memory and intelligence.\n3. Your car will drive you\nToday, around 30,000 Americans die in car accidents each year. One hundred years form now, accidents will be a thing of the past. According to Mark Safford, consultant or the U.S. Department of Transportation, future cars will drive themselves. These electric cars will communicate with other cars on the road to travel safely in close formation at high speeds.\n4. You will eat fake meat.\nRaising animals is not an efficient way to produce food, and it harms the environment: Cows, chickens, and pigs eat a lot, and then we have to deal with all that poop(. What's more, that poop can up poisoning lakes, rivers, and streams. Today, scientists can \"grow\" meat in a lab from animal cells, but it's expensive and not very delicious. In the future, they will have perfected the process. You'll order hamburgers that come from factories, not cows. Scientists may even find ways to make lab-grown meat tastier and healthier than the real thing.", "id": "high8507.txt"}
