The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self-help books.\nPhilip Davis, an English professor who has worked on the study with the university's magnetic resonance centre, will tell a conference this week: \"Serious literature acts like a rocket-booster to the brain.\n\"The research shows the power of literature to shift mental pathways, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and the elderly alike.\"", "id": "high3786.txt"}
