The 47-year-old firefighter crossed the finish line in Nome, Alaska, at 8:39 a.m. local time Wednesday morning. \n\"It feels good to be here,\" he declared, after passing the finish line. \"I'm ready for breakfast.\" \nFrosty temperatures, rough land, and exhaustion couldn't break the musher  , who completed the race in 9 days, 18 hours, 39 minutes, and 31 seconds. Runner-up Ed Iten finished 34 minutes later, and defending champ Mitch Seavey finished third. \nSorlie took his first lead at the 365-mile mark, but fell into second place halfway through the race. With 500 miles to go, he regained the lead for good. \nIditarod officials rewarded Sorlie with a generous prize of $72,066 and a new truck. But even more exciting for the winner was the historic nature of his ride. By winning this year's race, Sorlie joins a best group of mushers, becoming only the sixth person to win the Iditarod more than once. \nAfter winning several major long-distance races in Europe, Sorlie made his Iditarod first appearance in 2002, finishing in ninth place. A year later, he returned to take on the Alaskan wilderness once again, and won. \nIditarod: A Quick History\nSince 1973, the world's top competitors have gathered in Alaska to undertake the Iditarod's 1,150-mile trail, which stretches from Anchorage to Nome. \nThe race commemorates   a group of courageous mushers and dogs. In 1925, they traveled across part of the Idit trail to deliver serum   to save sick children in Nome.", "id": "high23721.txt"}
