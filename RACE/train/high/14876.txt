Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey   of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it, and only 35 percent say it's tolerated.\nSkeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced   by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \"working\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner.\nIt is true, however, that working at home makes people much more efficient  , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush.\nThe fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker.\nMore broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who haven't worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home. Under such circumstances, smart firms need to find ways to let their employees have enough ability to change or be changed easily to suit a different situation to manage their time efficiently.", "id": "high14876.txt"}
