But for Bangalore boy, Suhas Gopinath, it was.\nOne day in August, 1999, Suhas, studying at the Air Force School in Hebbal, was surfing the Net at a cyber cafe. He happened to hit an MSN source code  . That made him decide to learn more about HTML   and to design and set up his own website under the address of a US-based company, Network Solutions.\nHe kept updating his website, posting interesting things on it. This impressed Network Solutions and they invited him to attend a class on Web design and development. His mom and uncle criticised him for not taking his education seriously. But gradually, his dad started encouraging him and even bought him a computer and Net connection. In fact, that was his first investment in the company.\nOn May 14, 2000, along with friends Clifford Leslie and Binay M. N, he floated   his own website -- www.coolhindustani.com. He did not have the money to start, for his parents refused to give him a penny. So he wrote to Network Solutions Inc. in the US and they readily agreed.\nIn August, the same year, he set up Globals Inc., a Web solutions and networking company, with a team of four. Now, he has 400 employees, more than 200 customers across the globe and offices in 11 countries, and he is worth over $100 million.\nAfter finishing his high school education, he studied at Stanford University for two years.
