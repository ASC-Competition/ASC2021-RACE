It was a beauty: buttery smooth cowskin, with artfully sewed lines and long leather fringes  .\nI can't remember what the price was, but it was apparently too little for such a jacket. Even as I paid the money that day, I knew something wasn't right. Surely, a couple of days later, the jacket's real owner, a student about my age came to me as I was on my way to class.\n\"That's my jacket,\" he said, \"and I want it back.\"\n\"No way,\" I answered. \"I paid for it, and I have no idea if it's yours.

But just as important, it cleans up our own soul and sets us free.\nThat is a small price to pay for a clear conscience.", "id": "high5224.txt"}
