Are you still worrying about how to deal with them? Here below are some tips on how to deal with those difficult house guests.\nYou've been waiting an hour to eat breakfast but your guests are still sleeping.\n\"Unless you adjusted a time for breakfast the evening before, let your guests sleep-in and enjoy your breakfast without them. If possible, keep their breakfast warm. Or better yet, when entertaining it's always a good idea to have cold breakfast (as well as lunch, dinner and snack) food on-hand.\"\n----Pamela Eyring,president and director of The Protocol School of Washington\nYour guest's teenage son is a Facebook addict and hogs your computer all day long.\n\"If you have a guest whose fingers are fixated to your keyboard, kindly let him know that you are expecting work email and give him enough time to finish using it.\"\n----Ummu Bradley Thomas, founder of the Freddie Bell Jones Modeling and Finishing School, Inc.\nYour couch surfing, unemployed nephew has been here a month and is showing no sign of leaving.\n\"There is nothing wrong with saying 'John, you have been here a month and have not put in any applications. What can I do to help you get your resume together? I would like to make a plan that will assist you in getting back on your feet and allow me to eventually have my extra room back for guests that will soon be arriving.'\"\n----Diane Gottsman, owner of The Protocol School of Texas\nYour guests expect you to accompany them to every single tourist attraction in your city. It's tiring and expensive.\n\"If your guests didn't offer to treat you, politely decline and offer to meet them afterwards for dinner or drinks. That way they know you enjoy their company.\"\n----Pamela Eyring, president and director of The Protocol School of Washington\nYou gave your friend a closet shelf for her stuff but her clothes are thrown all over the place.\n\"You should simply say 'I am happy to have you use my closet but your clothes seem to have a mind of their own. Would you mind keeping your clothes on the top shelf? It would make it easier for me to find my things when I am in a rush and looking for them. Thank you.'\"\n----Diane Gottsman, owner of The Protocol School of Texas", "id": "high2671.txt"}
