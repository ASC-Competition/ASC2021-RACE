They played at festivals including the recent SXSW in Austin and Lollapalooza in their hometown, Chicago, to crowds of loyal fans.\nKTD uses a mix of hip-hop, jazz, blues and classic rock to make a sound of their own.\n\"KTD simply mixes most, if not all of my favourite music styles,\" said Kamia Jones, as Chicago high school student.\"I like that they aren't afraid to be different and that their music is real and speaks to the soul.\"\nThe band formed two years ago. Now, as well as local fans, they are becoming popular around the world. Their facebook page is filled with supportive posts from admirers from California to Tokyo.\n\"It's really strange to me that people from London, Australia and Russia... They have heard\nof us and they like our music because it's really cool feeling,\" says Marcie Stewart, who plays keyboard for the band.\nDespite their recent fame, KTD is a group of normal teenagers and they remain very close to one another. While talking to the reporters, they dance and make fun of each other.\nWhen asked what advice they would give to other teen musicians, Greg Landfair, KTD's drummer, said, \"Keep your heart in it. Never lose the music and what you are doing, because that's what you're here for. Let the music always be first.\"", "id": "high356.txt"}
