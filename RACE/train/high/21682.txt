Almost one in six men admitted they were most likely to lie to their wife or girlfriend, on average at least twice a day. The most popular lie was saying you had no mobile phone signal, with one in four people admitting regularly using the little white lie. It usually came after they hit the \"ignore\" button when their mobile rang. \nThree quarters of people think women are better liars. The research found 46 per cent of girls have been caught lying, compared to 58 of men. \nThe second most common fib  is \"I haven't got any cash on me\" when asked for money by tramps  , beggars and Big Issue sellers. \"Nothing's wrong - I'm fine\" came third followed by \"You look lovely\" and \"Nice to see you\".  \nModern technology turned out to have contributed to many lies with \"I didn't get your text\" in 18th, \"Our server was down\" in 20th and \"My battery died\" in 26th place. \nOther lies to make the top ten included \"I'll give you a ring\", \"We're just good friends\" and \"We'll have to meet up soon\". \"I'm on my way\" and \"No, your bum doesn't look big in that\" completed the top ten. \nMen tell the most fibs, coming out with five every day compared to women who lie just three times. \nIn many cases perhaps it is better to flatter with a fib than destroy someone with the truth, according to a spokesman for OnePoll, which carried out the research of 4,300 adults.", "id": "high21682.txt"}
