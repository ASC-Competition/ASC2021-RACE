Experts say that to achieve better road safety, various and comprehensive methods are needed. Updating the rules are only part of the story.\nAccording to the WHO (World Health Organization), traffic accidents kill more people around the world than malaria and are the leading cause of death for young people aged 5 to 29 -- especially in developing countries. Each year up to 1.3 million people are killed and more than 50 million injured in traffic accidents around the world.\nThe economic consequences are also significant: according to a study by the World Bank and Harvard University, traffic accidents on average cost a country 1 to 3 percent of its annual Gross National Product..\nThe newly revised regulations impose much heavier punishment on drivers who violate traffic rules. Under the new regulations, 52 different violations result in penalties, up from 38 under the previous system.\nEleven kinds of violations now result in the deduction of 12 points, compared to six points under the previous regulation. These violations include drunken driving and using fake license plates, as well as driving without a valid license.\nBut traffic regulations are only one aspect of many regarding problems with road safety in China. Other components of road safety include technology and urban design.", "id": "high17734.txt"}
