The team at Aston University created tiny bunch of cells which act like a mini nervous system.\nThey believe it could help find a cure for worse mental conditions like Parkinson's disease. Professor Michael Coleman is leading the research program. He explained, \"We are aiming to be able to study the human brain at the most basic level, using an actual living human cell system. Cells have to be alive and operating efficiently to enable us to really understand how the brain works. \"The experiment involves changing cells from a cancer tumour  and making them behave like brain cells.\nAlthough far from finished, researchers hope the false brain cells will give them a greater understanding of how real brains work. This, in turn, could significantly further research into conditions which affect the brain. Neil Hunt, chief leader of the research group, said, \"It is still very early days, but in the future the research could lead to a useful tool for looking into dementia  .\"\nThe technique could also provide a way to carry on animal test and is being supported by the Humane Research Trust (HRT). The scientists predict that over the next ten years a million people will develop dementia. Professor Coleman believes their findings could change this. He said,\"We hope our research will provide scientists with a new and highly relational human experimental model to help them understand the brain better and develop new drugs to control the related disease. However, the biggest challenge at present is that we are greatly short of fund, which will slow our research.\"", "id": "high6761.txt"}
