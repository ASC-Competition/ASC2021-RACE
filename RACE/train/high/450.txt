Hamburgers, French fries, and cold drinks were the main food there. Kroc opened similar eating places under the same name, \"McDonald's\", and they were an instant success. He later took over the company, and today it is one of the most famous and successful \"fast-food\" in America and around the world.\nWhy was his idea successful? Probably the most important reason was that his timing was right. In the 1950s, most married women stayed home to keep house and take care of their children. In the 1960s, many women returned to the workplace. This meant that they had less time or energy to prepare meals, so they spent more on \" TV dinners \" and fast-food restaurants. Single parents also have little time to spend in the kitchen. People living alone also depend on this type of food, since _ \nFast-food is not part of the diet of all Americans. Another trend of the 1960s, sometimes called the back-to-nature movement influenced many people to avoid food that was packaged   or processed . This preference for natural food continued to this day.\nFrom the success of Raymond Kroc's fast-food business, we can say that social economic trends influence where and what we eat.", "id": "high450.txt"}
