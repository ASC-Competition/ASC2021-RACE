It might be true to some extent, but as for an adult, a mobile means contact. It connects your work, relatives, friends, etc. It should do great deeds for us.\nMonths ago, my uncle gave his dear son a phone, because my nephew's school is far from his home. He can only come back once a term, and the phones haven't been so expensive yet. However, someone has criticized   the young people for playing on mobiles, but not using. They are fond of sending messages, taking pictures and so on. They buy expensive, high level and fashion types for showing. They play on the mobiles day in and day out ..... Holy cow!\nSo, what happens to youngsters around you? Do they have a phone? What do they use it for? Do you think it's necessary for teenagers who are still in school to have a phone?\nPOSTER 1:\nIn my view, mobile phones are only a tool for communication purpose, just like any other tools which have the potential   to be misused. In my opinion, I can see young people using it for security reason, emergency purpose, etc. If the parents can afford to pay big phone bills for their kids, well, that's their business, like the old saying goes, _ \n--- Mary Smith\nPOSTER 2:\nFrom psychological   point of view, teenagers are more likely to be relaxed or pleasure-oriented. They would like to make something different. Buying brands that are considered \"COOL\" is important to them. They want others to like and admire themselves, and sometimes, even exaggerate their own personality to show off. This can be seen as a kind of psychology during this certain range of age.\n--- Dick Gates\nCurrently, people should tend to be more sociable, and age should not be seen as a barrier for teenagers to own their phones. They also need to set trends on the social circuit  . But here parents should play an important role in controlling their children about how to use the phones more properly.", "id": "high5530.txt"}
