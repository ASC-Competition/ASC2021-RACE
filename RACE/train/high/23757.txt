Now, we will discuss four steps to change our lives and create a new future.\n   # 1. Think big. Get rid of negative beliefs.\n     Your beliefs have developed from what happened to you in the past. You should realize that the past is not equal to the future, unless you really live there. The first thing you need to do is to drive all the negative beliefs away from your mind. Those beliefs are not useful for creating a new future. Think that everything is possible if you put enough effort in it. When you change your beliefs into positive ones, you will feel more powerful. You will then be able to move on to the next level.\n   # 2. Write your plan to achieve your goals.\n     Your great goals should be divided into smaller goals. Make a timetable for each goal so that you can measure your progress. Write a detailed plan to achieve these goals.\n   # 3.Take action according to your plan.\n     Nothing bears fruit without action. Every successful person has to work hard towards his or her goals. There is no exception . Be prepared to work according to your plan. Be willing to invest   in the resources necessary for your progress. Do not give up.\n   # 4. Review what you have done and know how good you are.\n     While you are in the process of your work, take some time to review how well you have done. Review your progress based on your plan and see if you need to change anything. You can change your methods but you should not change your goals.", "id": "high23757.txt"}
