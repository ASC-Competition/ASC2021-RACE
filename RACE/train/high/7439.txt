But the government wants all primary school pupils in England to learn a language by the end of the decade.\nA survey of 1000 people was carried out, which is organised by the National Centre of Language .The study suggested people in London were the most likely(78%) to have studied another language, Scots were next at 74%, followed by the northeast of England (71%).In the west of England, more than six in ten have knowledge of another language.\nBarrie Hunt from OCR said, \"People are often very negative about Britain,s grasp of foreign languages but in reality the number of people who can speak a second language is impressive. The great joke is that many of these people will have no formal qualification to show their family, friends and employers what they can do. Whether they are fluent or just able to hold a short conversation in another language is unknown.\"\nHe said OCR had set a new language scheme called Asset Languages to encourage people of all ages to learn languages in bite-sized amounts and get a qualification.\nThe scheme also provides assessment for community languages spoken at home, such as Chinese, Urdu and Punjabi.\nIsabella Moore from the National Centre of Languages said, \"Employers want evidence of good communication skills, confidence and outward-looking attitudes, so a language qualification is an important addition to anyone,s resume.\"", "id": "high7439.txt"}
