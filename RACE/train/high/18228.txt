The whites may not be getting white enough or the color1s might be fading. This can cause you more money if you don't know how to properly do your laundry. These tips are lifesaving tips when it comes to washing your dirty clothes. \n   If you have a habit of throwing all your clothes into the washing machine together, you need to stop now. Washing your clothes in the same load will only cause them to fade onto each other or not become as clean as they could. \n   To save you lots of time, try buying a laundry sorter so that your clothes are already sorted and ready to be throne into the washing machine. \n   Another great advice would be to read the labels on the back of the clothing. The labels are there for a reason and this could help to save you a lot of money in the long run. It makes sense not to wash something in warm water when it specifically says to wash in cold water, if you did you could end up with a shrunken sweater. \n   There are basically five groups that your laundry should be sorted into; whites, lights, darks, bright color1ed clothes, and delicates. \n   The whites are basically anything white like your undergarments and t-shirts. Try not to get the whites and the lights confused. \nThe light color1ed clothes are those that can be white, striped, off-whites, pastels, cream color1ed, etc. \n   Dark clothes are those including blacks, blues, and browns. The reason that this is important is because dark clothes tend to fade onto other clothes and there are also special products like Woolite Dark that you can buy to keep them from fading. It just makes sense to wash these separately. \n   The bright clothes are those that are red, yellow, orange, green, florescent, etc. These clothes can make your other clothes turn color1s.", "id": "high18228.txt"}
