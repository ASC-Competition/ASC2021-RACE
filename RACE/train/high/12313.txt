I never knew how great an effect I could have on that single family.\nFrom the moment I walked into French class, I knew almost instantly that I belonged there. My teacher, Madame Weiser, is a kind and caring woman, and is the person who started the interest within me to help a family abroad, no matter how many miles apart.\nBack in 2011, my teacher traveled as a tourist to Maxi, a country settled in West Africa with a large French-speaking population. She didn't expect to adopt an entire family, but fate had other plans. Madame met a nice man named Monsieur Diarra, a driver who had shown her the way through the dry lands of Mali.\nMali is now a war-torn country and unsafe for tourists to visit, leaving little work for taxi drivers. Madame Weiser realized how Monsieur Driarra's family struggled on a daily basis, for he had a wife and four children to support as well as their grandmother, so she made a final decision to send the family as much money as she could raise every month.\nNow, three years later, Madame Weiser has still kept up her fund, collecting money from family and friends as well as students to support _ . It has become more than just my teacher donating to her adopted family abroad.\nAs president of French Club at my high school and a French Honor Society member, I decided that our club should work to raise money for the family in need. By washing cars, we raised over $1,000.\nFrom my experience, I've learned that making an effort is worth more than anything. Its effect is priceless!", "id": "high12313.txt"}
