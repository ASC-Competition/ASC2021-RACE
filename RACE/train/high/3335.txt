But because of many people, lots of things are easy to be out of order, and sometimes it's also easy to _ . Today was a day I wish I did not get out of bed. I mean that if I did not have to wake up and deal with all the things that I deal with on a daily basis, it would have been wonderful.\nI had a cup of coffee this morning and that was my meal for breakfast, not healthy I know. Anyway, my stomach was sounding like a truck. So, I jumped in my car and decided to buy some food.\nI was in line at Taco Bell   and the line was like a long snake!
