He stopped right next to me to greet his family.\nFirst he kissed his three children one by one and said, \"It's nice to see you. I missed you so much!\" Then he hugged his wife, \"I've saved the best for last!\" giving her the longest, most passionate kiss I ever remember seeing. They stared at each other's eyes, smiling at one another, while holding both hands. For an instant they reminded me of newlyweds , but I knew by the age of their kids that they couldn't  possibly be.\nFull of admiration, I asked, \"Wow! How long have you two been married?\" \"Being together for fourteen years total, married twelve of those.\" He replied, without breaking his gaze from his lovely wife's face. \"Well, then, how long have you been away?\" I asked. \"Two whole days!\" \"Two days?\" I was astonished. By the intensity   of the greeting, I had assumed he'd been gone for at least several weeks --- if not months. I knew _ so I turned away my eyes and said quietly, \"I hope my marriage is still that passionate after so long!\"\nThe man suddenly stopped smiling and looked me straight in the eye. With forcefulness he told me something that left me a different person. \"Don't hope, friend...decide!\" Then he smiled again, shook my hand and said, \"God bless!\"\nWith that, he and his family turned and walked away together.\nI was still watching that man and his special family walk just out of sight when my friend came up to me and asked, \"What are you looking at?\" Without hesitation, and with a curious sense of certainty, I replied, \"My future!\"", "id": "high514.txt"}
