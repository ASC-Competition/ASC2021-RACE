In the past six months alone, the site has won a Webby (the online version of the Oscar) for technical excellence, sets a new record for search engines by indexing a billion Web pages.\nYahoo still has 10 times the audience, but Google consistently ranks first in customer satisfaction: 97% of users find what they're looking for most or all of the time.\"You see people smile when they use it, like they've found something no one else knows about,\" says Danny Sullivan, editor of an online newsletter.\nNo one is smiling more than Larry Page, 27, and Sergey Brin, 26, who seem certain to become billionaires when the company goes public, probably sometime next year.They make a great comedy.When they first met as PhD students, the pair say, they found each other horrible--\"I still find him horrible,\" adds Brin--but were driven together by a computer science project aimed at coming up with better ways of searching the Web.\nThe idea behind Google is that traditional search engines are stupid.They think the connection is based on repetition; if you type in a request for Tiger Woods, say, you'll get websites listed according to how many times those words appear.Not only is this no guarantee  of quality, but it's also open to bad use.If you own a Tiger fan site and want to lead more people to it, simply type his name thousands of times in the site's source code.", "id": "high17671.txt"}
