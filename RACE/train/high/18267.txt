The three-part technology system consists of an interactive PDA called the GooBall, a backpack and a removable LCD screen for each student. Students can sit, stand or lie down when using the devices, and are not limited to desks. \nThe idea was presented at last month's South by Southwest Interactive Conference. While some educators think the idea is interesting, they doubt whether schools will pay for the expensive and complicated system. \nThe GooBall is an interactive communication device with six layers of learning software. The device monitors a student's heart rate and body temperature and uses GPS to track where they are. It includes instant messaging, a compass, a watch, and a topic-specific alert system that directs a student to related articles and books about whatever they are studying. Students can also choose an animal icon to show their personality. \nThe backpack houses the main power supply for the system and holds some personal items. The pocket keeps items locked tight with a fingerprint security zipper. \nThe portable screen functions like a laptop, providing wireless Internet access and streaming video. It also has a touch screen interface. \n\"I think it's an excellent idea,\" said Gary Tankard, a sixth-grader who has seen the prototype  . \"I'm sure that 90 percent of kids would really like to have it.\"", "id": "high18267.txt"}
