I was somewhat puzzled why some one like him would be searching through rubbish. Finding this a little  _ , I asked him, \"What are you searching for?\" He replied very simply that he was looking for bills of money.\nAfter talking with him for a little longer, I found out that he had become homeless just three months ago after getting laid off from his job. Since then, he had been working part-time jobs in a doctor's office and in a food bank to earn some money. But he made so little that he lost heart. The man seemed fairly talented, although a little dirty.\nI offer him a freshly baked peanut cake that I had baked that day. His eyes lit up, and he eagerly jumped at my offer. He immediately took the cake with his dirty hands and quickly began eating the treat on the spot.\nI told him that our thought creates our reality, and suggested that he not give up and think in a positive way. I also said that he was young and everything was possible. As he chews the cake, what I said seemed to have an effect on him, and he told me that he would cheer up and try to find a good job.\nMy sense told me that he might begin to see things a little differently from then on.
