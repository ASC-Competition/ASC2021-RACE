Suddenly, a large frog laughed in front of him. Coyote pounced   and pinned   Frog to the ground. Frog thought quickly and came up with a plan. \"Brother Coyote,\" he called. \"You must not eat me today!\"\nCoyote laughed loudly,  _ \n\"Why, I have a bet to make with you,\" Frog stated. \"Tomorrow there is to be a race.\" Coyote's ears twitched. \"A race?\"\n\"Yes,\" Frog continued. \"You and I will race. If you win, then you may eat me.\" Coyote agreed. Frog hurried to the lake. \nIn the morning, the animals gathered to watch as Coyote and Frog agreed on the course they would run. They were to start at the large stone and circle all the way around the lake. The first one back to the stone would be the winner. When the sun reached the noonday mark, they were off. Coyote ran as quickly as he could. Frog bounded into the grass and waited. Coyote looked behind him. Seeing no sign of Frog, Coyote was sure he would win. As Coyote was beginning to tire, Frog's look-alike friend jumped onto the course from behind an alder tree ahead. Coyote was surprised to see what he thought was Frog, and ran even faster, determined to win. Coyote dashed past him and called, \"You may be fast, but I'm faster, I'll wait at the finish line to eat you up, Frog!\"\nWhen Coyote came in sight of the finish line, Frog had appeared from his hiding place and easily hopped across the line. \"You may be fast, Coyote, but I've managed to beat you!\" Frog joyfully called out. Silently, he added, \"With the help of my friends.\"\nCoyote went home puzzled and hungry again.", "id": "high23448.txt"}
