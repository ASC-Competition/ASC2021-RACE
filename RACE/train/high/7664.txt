Wiki is the Hawaiian word for quick. Wiki websites are designed to enable users to make addition or edit any page Of the site.\nWikipedia has been accused of exhibiting systemic prejudice and mistakes.Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for much of the information makes it unreliable,\nMention Wikipedia within the walls of academy and you'll find no shortage of opinions.That-s no surprise.Can an online encyclopedia that is edited by anyone be trusted as a credible information source? Should students be encouraged to use this tool? And is it even possible to discourage its users?\nTo find out, we performed a simple experiment.We selected 100 terms from the U.S.history textbooks, We chose a mix of items that students might be asked to research for a test or paper and we entered each item into Google to find out which websites the search engine suggests as the most useful links. The results are shocking. Google listed Wikipedia as the number one:  87 times out of 100.\nSeveral conclusions can be drawn from this finding. First,  people searching for information about these historical terms are finding the entries from Wikipedia helpful.Second, 6'banning\" the use of Wikipedia appears hopelessly simple-minded.Jimmy Wales, one of Wikipedia's founders, told the New York Times, \"They might as well suggest not listening to rock & roll either\".\nTo our untrained eyes, the information from Wikipedia appeared just as reliable.The reason why the content is mostly reliable is probably that these terms are rather mainstream.The high-school level content is less likely to be wrong than the subjects studied in graduate schools. So when  primary and secondary students are researching history, Wikipedia is still a proper place to start.", "id": "high7664.txt"}
