She helps them grow bigger and better crops. Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food.\nIn the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus   kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops.\nWambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri.\nThe lab mainly works on genes  , the chemical \"computer programs\" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering.\nWambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes.\nThat's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified   foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry.", "id": "high12507.txt"}
