It is a fully-sustainable eco-village on the Big Island of Hawaii located about 29 miles southeast of Hilo and 9 miles east of Pahoa. And it is within easy walking distance of the coastline--one mile north of Hwy 132, just off Hwy 137.\nSolar power supplies our electrical needs, and water catchment tanks hold enough rain water for our use. Fruit trees and vegetable gardens are located throughout our tropical landscape and can be harvested at any time by the residents   for their own personal consumption  .\nWe accept all lifestyles and belief systems, and encourage individuality and diversity. A good attitude and an easy-going manner are most important to us; those qualities go a long, long way here!\nTuesdays are a fun and big day here. In the morning, we all get together for a few hours for various work projects. In the afternoon, many will hop in the truck for a trip to the town of Pahoa. That evening, we then are all treated to what is well-known throughout this region as \"Taco Tuesday\". Anyone is welcome to join us from the surrounding areas, which makes for a large gathering each week. It's certain that drummers and other musicians will be playing around the fire pit each \"Taco Tuesday\". \nWith the exception of the few hours of work on Tuesdays, residents are free to do whatever they please. Some just relax, while others may snorkel  , surf, swim, shop, backpack, camp, go sightseeing, watch the lava flow, etc.\nIt's rare that someone leaves this area without feeling it is a life-changing experience. There are also many who decide to make it their permanent home. \nWe are very welcoming. Come to give us a visit! Mahalo!", "id": "high22647.txt"}
