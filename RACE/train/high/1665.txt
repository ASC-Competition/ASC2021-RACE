But there is one question that has millions of current answers. That question is \"What's your name?\" Everyone gives a different answer, but everyone is correct.\nHave you ever wondered about people's names? Where do they come from? What do they mean?\nPeople's first names, or given names, are chosen by their parents. Sometimes the name of a grandparent or other member of the family is used. Some parents choose the name of a well-known person. A boy could be named George Washington Smith; a girl could be named Helen Keller Jones.\nSome people give their children names that mean good things. Clara means \"bright\"; Beatrice means \"one who gives happiness\"; Donald means \"world ruler\"; Leonard means \"as brave as a lion\".\nThe earliest last names, or surnames, were taken from place names. A family with the name Brook or Brooks probably lived near brook ;someone who was called Longstreet probably lived on a long, paved road. The Greenwood family lived in or near a leafy forest.\nOther early surnames came from people's occupations. The most common occupational name is Smith, which means a person who makes things with iron or other metals. In the past, smiths were very important workers in every town and village. Some other occupational names are: Carter -- a person who owned or drove a cart; Potter --a person who made pots and pans.\nThe ancestors of the Baker family probably baked bread for their neighbors in their native village. The Carpenter's great-great-great-grandfather probably built houses and furniture.\nSometimes people were known for the color of their hair or skin, or their size, or their special abilities. When there were two men who were named John in the same village, the John with the gray hair probably became John Gray. Or the John was very tall could call himself John Tallman. John Fish was probably an excellent swimmer and John Lightfoot was probably a fast runner or a good dancer.\nSome family names were made by adding something to the father's name. English-speaking people added -s or -son. The Johnsons are _ of John; the Roberts family's ancestor was Robert. Irish and Scottish people added Mac or Mc or O. Perhaps all of the MacDonnells and the McDonnells and the O'Donnells are descendants of the same Donnell.", "id": "high1665.txt"}
