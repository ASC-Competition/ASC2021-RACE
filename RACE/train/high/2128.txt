Both sides are trying to close the deal with a decreasing number of uncommitted  voters, while making sure supporters actually cast ballots.\nThat means a game of campaign chess that started Thursday, with appearances by the candidates  and their assistants as well as advertising dollars allocated to the places considered most vital to success.\nConcluding a race expected to cost more than $6 billion overall, Obama and Romney and their running mates will hit all the battleground states -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin. The campaigns also are unloading a blast of television ads and mailings that threaten to overwhelm voters already saturated with politicking.
