It's someone who wins when no one expects it.\nHan Xiaopeng took China's first gold on snow. He became an Olympic \"dark horse\" by winning the gold medal in men's freestyle aerial skiing  at Turin in Italy. He made two almost perfect jumps for the highest score. Han had never won a world gold medal before, let alone  in the Olympics!\n\"I never thought this would happen,\" said the 23-year-old. \"I feel like I'm in a dream.\" It's China's second gold medal at the Turin Olympics. But more important, Han's gold was the country's first ever in a snow sport. In 2002, China's Yang Yang won the gold for speed skating at the winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, US.\nThat Han's win was unexpected doesn't mean that he didn't work hard.\nHan grew up in Jiangsu Province. Before he started his training on snow, he used to be an acrobat  at a circus. In 1995, a coach found his talent . The coach, Yang Er'qi, said Han had the agility  and courage to be a ski jumper. When Yang first took the 12-year-old to northern China, the boy couldn't swim, skate or ski. But he wasn't afraid of the high platform  and kept on training.\nHan almost left the sport after hurting his knee months before the Salt Lake Games. In that Olympics he only got 24th. \"I was hopeless at that time, but my family and the coach stood firmly  behind me, helping me through,\" he recalled.\n Han Xiaopeng worked so hard that he won the gold medal in the Olympics at last. Because of his success, more and more people in China are becoming interested in skiing. We are proud of him and we hope he will have another big success in the next winter Olympics.", "id": "high17035.txt"}
