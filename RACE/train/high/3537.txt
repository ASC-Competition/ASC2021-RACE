One day a young visitor looked at this wasteland and called it an awful area. Paul knocked him down. From then on, something happened inside him.\nYears later Paul was back in the area, and he went to the smelter office. He asked if they had any plans or if they would let him try to bring the trees back. The answer from that big industry was \"No.\"\nPaul then went to college to study the science of plants. Unfortunately, his teachers said there weren't any birds or squirrels to spread the seeds. It would be a waste of his life to try to do it.

Under the cover of darkness, he went secretly into the wasteland and started planting.\nAnd every week, he made his secret journey into the wasteland and planted trees and grass. For fifteen years he did this against _ . Slowly rabbits appeared. Later, as there was legal pressure to clean up the environment, the company actually hired Paul to do what he was already doing.\nNow the place is fourteen thousand acres of trees and grass and bushes, and Paul has received almost every environmental award Utah has. It took him until his hair turned white, but he managed to keep that impossible vow  he made to himself as a child.", "id": "high3537.txt"}
