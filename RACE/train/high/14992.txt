Scientists named her Lucy from the Beatles song \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", which was played at the camp the night of her discovery.\nThe following analysis of the slices showed sharp, clean breaks seen at the end of Lucy's right humerus  are similar to bone breaks seen in victims of falls.\nThe researchers concluded that these and other breaks in her skeleton show that Lucy, who is believed to have stood about 3 feet 6 inches and weighed about 60 pounds, fell feet first and used her arms to support herself -- but that the injury was too severe to have been survivable.\nThe researchers estimate that Lucy was going about 35 miles an hour when she hit the ground after falling from a height of roughly 40 feet, according to the statement.\nThat sounds _ . But other scientists are doubtful. \"There are countless explanations for bone breaks,\" Dr, Donald C, Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins and one of the scientists who discovered Lucy, said, \"The suggestion that she fell out of a tree is largely a just-so story and therefore unprovable.\" Johanson said it was more likely that Lucy's breaks occurred long after she died, saying that \"elephant bones appear to have the same kind of breaks, It's unlikely they fell out of a tree. \"\nBut the new research focused on \"a small number of breaks\" that are consistent with \"high-energy bone-to-bone influences\" and which differ from the sorts of breaks commonly seen in other collected bones. Kappelman responded in an email, \"These appear to have occurred at or near the time of death.\"", "id": "high14992.txt"}
