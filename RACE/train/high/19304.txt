I lost a lot of jobs.I can understand people's reaction and why they don't believe me,\" said Mr Dunbar.\nMr Dunbar recently tried to go to the cinema and knowing it could be a problem getting there for a 7 pm showing, he gave himself an 11-hour head start.But he still managed to arrive 20 minutes late.\nHe has a special clock in his living room to make sure that the time it displays is always exactly right, but it doesn't help.He has tried wearing a watch, setting his clocks fast but still hasn't found a solution.\n\"I've been late for funerals and slipped in and hid at the back of the hall.I arranged to pick my friend up at midday to go on holiday and was four hours late.He was angry because we had booked a ferry and everything.A friend invited me for a meal and I was more than three hours late.It has affected my entire life.\"\nBut some experts are skeptical about Mr Dunbar's diagnosis.\n\"The condition isn't in the DSM5 (the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) so I'm not sure you can really call it a condition,\" said Dr Sheri Jacobson.\"Repeated lateness is usually a symptom of a condition such as ADHD or depression but it can also just be habit.I think making everyday human behaviour into a medical condition is unwise.\"", "id": "high19304.txt"}
