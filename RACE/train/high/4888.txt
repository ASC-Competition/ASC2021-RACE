Many Japanese never take the vacations they should enjoy, but with the coming of \"Golden Week\", several holidays following one after another in late April and early May, they pour out of the country in the tens of thousands.\nSo when traveling, whether on business or for pleasure, the first thing to think about are hotels. The kind of hotel you choose is decided according to how much money you want to spend. There are small hotels with very few services, where the prices are low, or there are large hotels with all the very latest comforts, where you could spend all the money you have in the bank for a very comfortable night.\nThere are several different kinds of people who go to hotels. Some want to live, rather than just stay, in a hotel; hotels which are designed to meet their needs are called residential hotels. However, most people who stay in hotels are either business people or tourists on holiday.\nIn most hotels, there are two kinds of rooms: single rooms, for the use of one person, and double rooms, for the use of two people. In addition, in large hotels, there are also suites  , which include two or more rooms connected together -- perhaps a bedroom and a living room. They are for people who are very rich or very important.", "id": "high4888.txt"}
