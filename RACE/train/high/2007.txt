There had been a rain. Water was dripping   from the trees,and the grass was wet. They rode slowly,talking and laughing. Suddenly they heard some noises from the tree above them. \"What is the matter?\" asked the first lawyer. \"Oh, it's only some old birds!\" said the second lawyer. \"The storm made one of the babies fall out of the nest. It is too young to fly, and the mother bird is very worried.\" \"What a pity! It'll die down there in the grass,\" said the third lawyer. \"It doesn't matter. It's only a bird,\" said the second lawyer. Then they rode on, talking and laughing as before. But the fourth lawyer, whose name was Abraham Lincoln, stopped. He got down from his horse and took the little one in his big warm hands.\n\"Never mind, my _ ,\" said Mr. Lincoln. \"I will put you back in your little nest.\" He climbed up the tree and put the bird softly into their warm little home. A few minutes later, Mr. Lincoln joined them again. His shoes were covered with mud and he was wet. Then the other three laughed at him. They thought it was foolish for a strong man to do so much just for a young bird. \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Lincoln, \"I could not sleep tonight if I had left the helpless bird in the grass.\" Later Abraham Lincoln became very famous as a lawyer. He also became the president of America. He was one of the greatest American presidents.", "id": "high2007.txt"}
