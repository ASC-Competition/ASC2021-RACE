Perhaps the most interesting has been the division of people into tribes (zu in Chinese).\n The pains of the yi zu, or the ant tribe, have been well-known --- recent graduates from outside the main cities who move to urban areas, live cheaply and work hard, often in low-paid jobs. Perhaps less well-known are the ken lao zu, the bite-the-old tribe, those between 25 and 35 who are out of work, still at home and depending completely on Mum and Dad.\nMany of the tribes, inevitably , are made up of people looking for love. There is the jia wan zu, the marry-the-bowl tribe. These are young women searching for the most stable husbands, the ones who hold government jobs. The shan hun zu, or lightening-marriage tribe, marry fast and sometimes separate faster. They should not be confused with the yin hun zu, the hidden-marriage tribe. These are women in their 20s who hide the fact that they are married. And if you can only afford a postage stamp of an apartment, you're probably a member of the wo ju zu, the snail-house tribe.\nYou can belong to more than one tribe. Most members of the ant tribe also belong to the ben ben zu, the rush-rush tribe, to which, in fact, most urban Chinese belong. All that rushing around can create a lot of anger, leading to the nie nie zu, the crush-crush tribe, so named because they go into supermarkets and take out their anger by standing in the passages crushing packets of instant noodles.\nAnother famous one is the yue guang zu, or moonlight tribe, so named because the Chinese characters for \"moonlight\" sound the same as the phrase \"spend all your monthly salary\". Their parents save every coin, but life for these young people is just to spend, spend and spend.", "id": "high17196.txt"}
