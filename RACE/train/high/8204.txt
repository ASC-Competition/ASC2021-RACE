He tied a small silver lure   on his fishing rod   and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused ripples   in the black water.\nWhen his rod bent over, he knew something huge was on the other end. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully pulled the fish in. Finally, he lifted it from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a bass.\nThe boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10pm --two hours before bass season began. The father looked at the fish, then at the boy.\n\"You'll have to put it back, son.\" he said.\n\"Dad!\" cried the boy.\n\"There will be other fish,\" said his father.\n\"Not as big as this one,\" cried the boy.\nHe looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around. He looked again at his father's stern face. Even though no one had seen them, the boy knew that the decision was not negotiable .He slowly lowered the fish back into the water.\nThe creature swam away. The boy thought that he would never again see such a great fish.\nThat was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's house is still there by the lake. He takes his own son and daughters fishing there.\nHe has never again caught such a large fish as the one he landed that night long ago. But he does see that same fish again and again---every time he faces a question of right and wrong. His father taught him it is the practice of doing right that is difficult.\nDo we do right when no one is looking?", "id": "high8204.txt"}
