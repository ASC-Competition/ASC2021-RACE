The three leaders emphasized the importance of cooperation in dealing with North Korea.\nThe meeting took place Tuesday in the Hague, after a twoday nuclear security summit. President Obama praised South Korean President Park Geunhye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for overcoming their differences to discuss a serious threat to regional peace. He emphasized the importance of cooperation on the North Korean nuclear issue.\nObama said the three discussed steps to deepen diplomatic  and military cooperation, including joint military exercises and missile  defense against Pyongyang. He said further discussions would take place next month, during his visits to Seoul and Tokyo.\nThe South Korean president stressed the importance of a united response to North Korea, but also called on the North to choose a peaceful path. \"I sincerely hope that this meeting will offer a chance for us to reconfirm our trilateral  coordination and strengthen the cooperation on the nuclear front,\" said Park.\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed. \"Particularly it is extremely important that we were able to confirm close cooperation among Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea on the issue of North Korea, the three countries who would like to cooperate so that North Korea will be able to take a positive position with regard to nuclear and missile issue,\" said Abe.\nJapan and South Korea have several unresolved issues, including Japan's refusal to apologize again for crimes committed 70 years ago.
