They found that people who exercised while listening to Italian musician Antonio Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\" did much better on language ability tests than without music.\n\"Facts suggest that exercise improves the learning ability of people with heart disease,\" said the psychologist Charles Emery, who led the study. \"And listening to music is thought to _ understanding. We just wanted to put the two results together,\" he added.\nThe volunteers said they felt better emotionally and physically after working out with or without the music. But their improvement on the test doubled after listening to music during exercise. Scientists have proved that music can be good for health, education and well-being. It helps reduce stress, sadness and nervousness; encourages relaxation or sleep; wakes up the body and improves memory and thoughts.\nIn medical fields, music is used widely for patients who have had head hurts before and after operation. \"The Four Seasons\" was used because of its moderate tempo and positive results in earlier research. \"Exercise seems to cause positive changes in the nervous system  and these changes may have a direct result on learning ability,\" Emery said.\nScientists have been studying the results of music on understanding since the early 1950s. By 2000, psychologists were using Mozart's music, especially his violin pieces, to help children with speech disorders. Mozart was chosen because his music is not overexciting and has clear structures. A study showed students who listened to Mozart went on to score higher marks in an intelligence test. With important exams drawing near, your parents will not probably allow you to listen to music. But perhaps now you have good reasons to argue with them.", "id": "high2963.txt"}
