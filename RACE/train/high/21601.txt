It just so happened that the book shelves were next to the toy section. After a few minutes I became aware of a group of women standing behind me. They were poorly dressed and spoke in what sounded like an eastern European language. As they looked through the clothes rails a little girl, about three years old, came over to the toy section. Immediately her attention was caught by a toy pram . What is it about little girls and toy prams? I don't know, but whatever it is its incredibly cute!\nShe spoke to her mother and, in halting English her mother asked the shop assistant how much it cost. Three pounds was the answer---about five dollars. The mum looked down at her child, perhaps calculating what she still had to buy and how much money she would have left. Then she simply shook her head.  \nThe child didn't react badly as some might. Being told \"no\" was obviously not a new experience for her. But she couldn't keep the disappointment from her face.\n I had the grand total of four pounds in my pocket, two two-pound coins. A moment later I tapped the mother on the shoulder, pointed to the coins which I had left in the pram and said, \"Buy her a dolly too.\"\n I didn't hang about to see the end result. After all, it's not about being thanked. I made my way out of the shop and into the sunshine.\n The money was an investment in the happiness of the world. Was there any better way, I wondered, to get so much happiness for so little money than to buy a little girl a toy pram? And a dolly to sit in it!", "id": "high21601.txt"}
