Tested in three different experiments, the researchers found out a small but significant preference for reddish colors in the female volunteers.\nPuzzled, the authors realized that most of the difference between men and women came in the form of a preference for green VS red in the color cards, regardless of the other slight differences such as the slightly blue ones that everyone liked. Why might this be?\nEvolution might offer an answer, they reason. Human color perception , the assessment of three separate color types -- red -- green -- blue-- in our vision   is a relatively recent addition to our line of mammals \nAdding weight to their argument, they found the women who are most typically feminine  on a psychological survey also had the biggest preference for reddish colors. \"My love is like a red, red rose,\" wrote the Scottish poet Rober Burns in 1794.", "id": "high3017.txt"}
