Every day is a new day and a fresh start to learn, grow, develop your strengths, heal yourself from past regrets or hurts, and move forward older and wiser. Every day gives you a chance to reinvent yourself, to fine-tune who you are, and build on lessons of what you have learned. It is never too late to change things that are not working in your life and switch gears, instead of thinking in the same old ways, hoping for a different outcome.\nBe intelligent, be flexible, and keep and open mind to start each day anew! Flexibility is the key!\nAsk yourself: How do you wake up each day? Do you start your day going already feeling pressured and rushed? Do you go through the morning routine without much thought at all, doing what you \"have to do\" to start your day?\nHow about starting each new day with a moment to stop, breathe and think of a positive intention for the day.\nThink not just what you want to DO, but how you want to BE today?\nEach day is a new beginning and a blank slate. How would you like to create your day? Think of it as a blank canvas -- what would you like to paint on it. What can you create? If you wake up in a negative mindset, you are more likely to paint a dark picture throughout the day, and your canvas will not reflect hope, happiness and joy.\nIf you take each day to think positively, and have a positive intention for how you would like to create your day, how would your life be different? What positive outcome can reflect your positive intention?\nWhat can daily positive intentions do for you? Every day you will give yourself the gift of an \"attitude of gratitude.\"\nVisualizing how you would like your day will help release positive energy from within you and you will attract more positive energy from those around you. Instead of spinning your wheels in an old way of thinking, each day is a chance to reframe and re-look at things in a different way.\nYou can experience each day an awe  in the beauty and creation of the world -- and the beauty of you who is in it!\nYou find yourself shifting from an \"I can't mindset\" to an \"I can\" mindset.\nWith a focus on positive intentions, you feel more empowered and more like a \"victor\" than a \"victim.\"\nYou are more mindful of the present, and will be more likely to live fully in the present each moment of each day. After all, the past is a great place to visit, but you don't want to live there!\nSo how about starting each day taking a moment to think of a positive intention for the day? Each morning, write it down and reflect each evening on how you did!\nHere are examples of Positive Intentions:\n\"Today I would like to replace my feelings of annoyance towards my co-worker to feelings of acceptance.\"\n\"I am looking forward today to focusing on what I am grateful for in my life, rather than what is missing, and express gratefulness to others.\"\n\"Today I want to slow my life down and take time to savor the moment, especially with my children\".. \nUsing each day to recommit yourself to positive thinking and intention will help you create the life you want and that you deserve!", "id": "high16363.txt"}
