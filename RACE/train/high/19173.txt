The history of volleyball dates back to 1895 when William G.Morgan met a Canadian James Naismith, inventor of basketball and was influenced by him and basketball.Then he wanted to invent a new game that was fit for middle-aged men.\nMorgan enjoyed the game of basketball, but soon he realized that it was too fast paced for some of the older men.So, he decided to invent a game that was still played on a court , but the players were not required to run up and down--he created the game of \"mintonette.\" Volleyball history shows that the original game of mintonette was played on a full court with a net in the middle.Two teams tossed the ball back and forth over the net, similar to the game of badminton.In order to cut down the equipment costs, the players played the ball with their hands.\nThe game quickly became popular, and everyone wanted to learn how to play volleyball.It quickly spread to other areas, across the United States, and even to other countries.Several changes were made to the game.\nThen specific volleyball rules were set into place.Some of the rules of volleyball included the court size, number of players, and number of hits per team.The rules also stated that players must rotate  around the court so that everyone had a turn to serve the ball.Also, a standard volleyball size and shape were decided within a few years.The rules continued to change and adjust throughout the history of volleyball, until the game became what we have today.\nEven though volleyball history says that the game was originally created for middle-aged men, the game has become so popular among all kinds of people.Today there are many different kinds of competitive volleyball teams: high school volleyball, college volleyball, women volleyball, men, children, mixed teams, etc.There is an endless amount of possibilities with this game because it is easy to learn, many people can play together, and it can by played indoors or outside.", "id": "high19173.txt"}
