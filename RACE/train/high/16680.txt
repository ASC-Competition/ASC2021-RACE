You have to be very responsible if you have decided to keep birds as pets. If you really want to acquire a companion, think in advance whether you are able to handle it.\nDepending on what pet bird you are going to have and how big it is, the cost is different. For example, the cost of a comfortable cage, the cost for nutritional food and the money for some additional things should be taken into consideration. There are also some unexpected cost. For example, when your pet bird gets sick, you have to send for a vet  .\nYou may think that you do not have free time to have a dog so you'd better have a pet bird because it doesn't require a lot of attention. You are wrong! Some people even do not have time for a short sleep. They will not have enough time for pets, either. For good bird health it is very important to handle them and play with them as much as you can.\nAlso there are a lot of people who think that birds do not require a lot of space and they are wrong again. They also need to fly so if you do not have space for it, you'd better reconsider the things. \nBut do not forget the great advantage of having a pet bird.
