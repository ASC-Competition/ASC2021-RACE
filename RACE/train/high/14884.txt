About 50 percent of engaged employees say they have no plans to leave their company versus 15 percent of the disengaged.\n\"The fact that almost 80 percent of workers are disengaged is likely costing companies money.\" Gebauer said.\n\"The conception of engagement is really a financial issue,\" said Gebauer. 'Organizations that have employees that are highly engaged deliver better financial results than those that don't.\"\nIn a separate study, Towers Perrin assessed data on 40 global companies over a three-year period, measuring employee engagement at a certain point and then looking at the companies' financial results over the following three years.\nCompanies with highly motivated workers enjoyed a 3.7 percent increase in profits, while companies with a lower level of worker commitment saw a decrease in profits slightly.\nWhat makes for an engaged employee? It's not necessarily pay. While the level of pay is important, it's not among the top 10 drivers of engagement. Rather than only using the pay, companies should survey their work force, much as they might study their customers, to assess what employees are seeking.", "id": "high14884.txt"}
