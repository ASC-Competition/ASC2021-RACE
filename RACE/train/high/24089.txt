First of all,food systems between China and West are different.Chinese put into practice Gather Dining System;westerners put into practice Individual Dining System.Everybody can share the delicious food of all over the table when eating Chinese food.Please note it is sharing,but westerners just eat the food in one's own plate.If you eat beef and he eats chicken,it is impossible that you taste the flavor of his chicken.The  result of the Individual Dining System is that you can only eat the food in your plate.\nSo to eat Chinese food is happier than to eat Western-style food.And I want to ask you a question.Do you like the free thing? I think nobody doesn't like the free thing.Ok! Suppose I invite you to eat the delicious Chinese food,then I pay the bill.This is equivalent to that you have enjoyed a delicious Chinese food free.So you will be very glad.It will strengthen the relation between us in the happy atmosphere.\nSecondly,westerners eat for the health;Chinese eat for the friendship.Westerners advocate individualism and independence is strong.So westerners express that respect for each other's independence through the way go Dutch.Chinese like making friends and solidarity.Chinese value the interpersonal relationships and the friendship very much.\nThird,it is only simple \"Have a meal!\" for westerners to entertain guests.Unlike the purpose and the  _ that Chinese entertain guests,in Americans' idea,\"Have a meal\" definition is to add fuel to the body for keeping health and normal life activity.That is to say,there is not any additional value.In the Chinese idea,\"Have a meal\" not only is a kind of life enjoyment,but also is the means to promote friendship between the friends.After enjoying the sumptuous delicious food,you are glad,and I am glad too.The friendship between the friends has been strengthened in this kind of atmosphere.", "id": "high24089.txt"}
