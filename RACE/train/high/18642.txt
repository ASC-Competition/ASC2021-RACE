They make that decision on whether a woman would be a good mating partner in milliseconds.\nThis is something very ancient and a way of helping men find the best mate to produce children.\nWomen were not distracted by attractive male faces because women need more proof of whether a man is a good mate.\n\"Women make that decision on behaviour, whether a man is trustworthy and committed. They make their decision much later than men.\"", "id": "high18642.txt"}
