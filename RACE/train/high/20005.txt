It was the first serious one in 40 years of farming side by side, sharing machinery, and trading labor and goods as needed.\n      Then the long cooperation fell apart. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major difference, and finally it exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence.\n      One morning there was a knock on John' door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. \"I'm looking for a few days' work,\" he said. \"Could I help you?\"\n     \"Yes,\" said the older brother. \"I do have a job for you. Look across the creek  at that farm. That's my neighbor, in fact, it's my younger brother. Last week there was a meadow  between us and he took his bulldozer  to the levee  and now there is a creek between us. Well, he may have done this to spite me, but I'll go him one better. I want you to build me a fence--an 8-foot fence --so I won't need to see his place anymore. Cool him down, anyhow.\"\n     The carpenter said, \"I think I understand the situation. I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\" The older brother had to go to town for supplies, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day.\n  The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing. About sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped.\n      There was no fence there at all. It was a bridge-- a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work-- and his younger brother was coming across, his hand outstretched.\n  \"You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done.\"\n  The brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand. They turned to see the carpenter lift his toolbox on his shoulder. \"No, wait! Stay a few days. I've a lot of other projects for you,\" said the older brother.\n  \"I'd love to stay on,\" the carpenter said, \"but, I have so many more bridges to build.\"", "id": "high20005.txt"}
