Why does this happen? Should the parents take any measures?\n     On the one hand, people who spend a lot of time in front of the TV, especially teenagers may snack more, and that may affect their long-term diet quality.\n     On the other hand, TV ads for fast food, sweets and snacks tempt teenagers to eat more of those foods. And TV time might also replace exercise time for some kids.\nLead researcher Dr. Daheia J. BarrAnderson, of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, told Reuters Health a clear correlation  between TV time during high school and diet quality in young adulthood . While the heaviest TV viewers were eating the most junk food five years later, those who'd watched less than two hours per day had the highest intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and high-calcium food. In her opinion, parents should limit and monitor TV viewing.\nI think children should watch no more than two hours of television per day. And parents should set a good example by eating right, being physical active and curbing their own TV time.", "id": "high16872.txt"}
