More people were killed worldwide by natural disasters this year than have been killed in terrorism attacks in the past 40 years combined.\n\"It just seemed like it was back-to-back  and it came in waves,\" said Craig Fugate, who heads the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. It handled a record number of disasters in 2010.\n\"The term \"100-year event' really lost its meaning this year.\"\nAnd we have ourselves to blame most of the time, scientists and disaster experts say.\nEven though many disasters have the ring of random chance, the hand of man made this a particularly deadly, costly, extreme and strange year for everything from wild weather to earthquakes.\nPoor construction and development practices make earthquakes more deadly than they need be. More people live in poverty in vulnerable buildings  in crowded cities. That means that when the ground shakes, the river floods, or the tropical cyclone hits, more people die.\nDisasters from the Earth, such as earthquakes and volcanoes \"are pretty much constant,\" said Andreas Schraft, vice president of catastrophic perils for the Geneva-based insurance giant Swiss Re. \"All the change that's made is man-made.\"\nThe January earthquake that killed well more than 220,000 people in Haiti is a perfect example. Port-au-Prince has nearly three times as many people - many of them living in poverty- and more poorly built shanties  ,than it did 25 years ago. So had the same quake hit in 1985 instead of 2010; total deaths would have probably been in the 80,000 range, said Richard Olson, director of disaster risk reduction at Florida International University.\nClimate scientists say Earth's climate also is changing thanks to man-made global warming, bringing extreme weather, such as heat waves and flooding.\nThe excessive  amount of extreme weather that dominated 2010 is a classic sign of man-made global warming that climate scientists have long warned about. They calculate that the killer Russian heat wave - setting a national record of 111 degrees - would happen once every 100,000 years without global warming.\nData show that 18 countries broke their records for the hottest day ever.\n\"The Earth strikes back in response to bad human decision-making,\" said Debarati Guha Sapir.\" \"It's almost as if the policies, the government policies and development policies, are helping the Earth strike back instead of protecting from it. We've created conditions where the slightest thing the Earth does is really going to have a surprising impact.\" White House science adviser John Holdren said we should get used to climate disasters or do something about global warming. \"The science is clear that we can expect more and more of these kinds of damaging events unless and until society has sharply reduced the amount of heat-trapping gases and particles .\"", "id": "high1581.txt"}
