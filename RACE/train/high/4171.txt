So what changes might come in the way we get around? What big ideas are out there, and do they have any chance of coming true?\nPersonal Air Travel\nThe idea: flying cars\nDevelopments in light small plane technology will make it possible for everyone to own what are, in fact, flying cars. They will have closed cabins, heating, stereos and room for two people.\nYou will take off from a field near your home and fly to towns and cities. After landing, you will take off the fixed wing and continue your journey by road just as if you were traveling by car.\nFuel efficient engines and the advantage of being able to travel in the sky will keep costs and the environmental influence down.\nFlying for Fun\nThe idea: Jet Packs\nThe idea was a hit when a stuntman   flew around on one during the opening ceremony of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, which was very successful.\nYou'll be able to use the equipment-roughly the size of two scuba tanks fastened to your back-for short journeys.\nThey will be handy for cleaning hard-to-reach windows, arriving in style at a party and shopping.\nTaxis\nThe idea: driverless taxis\nThese computer-controlled taxis will take you wherever you want along a fixed route, whenever you want to go.\nFor the price of one person's bus fare, several people can ride at speeds of up to 25 mph, and there will be fences to guard against accidents.\nThere will be little, if any, wait for the use of the taxis, which will leave from stations and will be used by prepaid cards.\nThe taxis, which will travel on a 1.5 m-wide track, will use 75% less energy per passenger than a car and 50% less than a bus.", "id": "high4171.txt"}
