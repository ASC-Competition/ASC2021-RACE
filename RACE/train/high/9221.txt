Stop !\"\nGetting no response I called again, but my shouts were carried away in the opposite direction by the wind.Seconds passed.Nothing.I was gradually being left alone, completely defenseless against the low temperatures of Antarctica.\nMy strength increased when I thought of a cold lonely death.I pulled again my sledge, which moved a little. I removed the ice with my ski-pole and boot, desperately trying to break the sledge free.The sledge shot forward, knocking me off balance.I struggled to my feet and set off after the team.\nI caught up just as Reena, my teammate from India, looked behind her and noticed there was one person missing.She swung around on her skis in shock and spotted me in the near distance.\nAs we continued, my panic slowly faded.For the rest of the day, each of the team was glancing over their shoulder every few minutes.They were not going to risk losing me again.", "id": "high9221.txt"}
