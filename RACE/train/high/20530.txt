When you had your heart set on the toast beef, has your waiter merrily told you that he just served the last piece? It makes you, as traveler or diner, want to land your fist right on their unsympathetic faces.\n    Had my neighbor told me of the upcoming rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning.Had the Greyhound salesclerk sympathetically informed me that my bus had already left, I probably would have said \"Oh that's all right.I'll catch the next one.\" When they bear bad news, big winners deliver bombs with the emotion the bombarded   person is sure to have", "id": "high20530.txt"}
