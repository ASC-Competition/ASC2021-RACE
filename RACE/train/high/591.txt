He knows from experience what it means, as the Portuguese film director has reached the age of 102 and is still active in his profession. Every year, Oliveira shoots a film and is currently working on his next project. \"You have to work, work, work in order to forget that death is not far away,\" he said. When asked about his age, Oliveira said with some humility: \"It's down to mother nature. It gave to me what it took from others.\"\nBeing both mentally and physically fit in old age is partly a matter of luck, but it also has something to do with character. Not every white-haired person is wise and social skills, openness and the ability to train the brain are essential for senior citizens.\nAlong with the architect Oscar Niemeyer (103), Nobel laureate Montalcini (101) and director Kurt Maetzig (100), Oliveira is one of those people of whom it would be very wrong to think as members of a listless elderly generation.\nAnother master in his profession is the architect Oscar Niemeyer. The 103-year-old Brazilian is best known for his futuristic-looking buildings in Brasilia, but he also speaks out on behalf of the poor. \"The role of the architect is to struggle for a better world where we can develop a form of architecture that serves everyone and not just a privileged few,\" said Niemeyer recently. He spends almost every day working in his office in Copacabana, and even when he falls ill he keeps working on ideas: After a gallbladder   operation he composed a samba tune   in the clinic.\nAnother man who could sing a song about age is 107-year-old Heesters. The Dutch-born opera singer spent most of his life performing in Germany, where he still works. Recently Heesters said: \"I want to be at least 108-years-old.\" He also plans to keep performing. \" _ \" Heesters has not given up trying to add to his tally of awards and is looking for a \"good stage role\".\nItalian scientist Rita Levi-Montalcini, who is 101-year-old and is still active in medical science, has described the force that keeps driving her on: \"Progress is created through imperfection.\" In 1986 she and her lab colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their work on nerve growth factor. She's convinced that humans grow on challenges.\nWith so many brilliant examples given, we can see clearly that age is no barrier to some high achievers.", "id": "high591.txt"}
