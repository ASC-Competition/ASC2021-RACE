'housewife' covers it,\" said the recorder.\nOne day I found myself in the same situation.The clerk was obviously a career woman, confident and possessed of a high sounding title.\"What is your occupation?\" she asked.\nThe words simply popped out.\"I'm a Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human Relations.\"\nThe clerk paused, ballpoint pen frozen in midair.\nI repeated the title slowly, and then I stared with wonder as my statement was written in bold, black ink on the official questionnaire.\n\"Might I ask, \"  said the clerk with new interest, \"Just what you do in this field?\"\nCoolly, without any trace of panic in my voice, I heard myself reply, \"I have a continuing program of research (what mother doesn't), in the lab and in the field (normally I would have said indoors and out).Of course, the job is one of the most demanding in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?), and I often work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it).But the job is more challenging than most careers and rewards are more of a satisfaction rather than just money.\"\nThere was an increasing note of respect in the clerk's voice as she completed the form, stood up, and showed me out.\nAs I drove into our driveway, buoyed up   by my glamorous new career, I was greeted by my lab assistants---ages 13, 7, and 3.\nUpstairs I could hear our new experimental model (a 6 month old baby), in the child-development program, testing out a new vocal pattern.\nI felt proud!
