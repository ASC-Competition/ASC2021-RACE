China was only ranked 112th happiest country out of 156 in the UN's World Happiness Report in April.\nThe happiest country, it seems, is Denmark, closely followed by three more northern European countries- Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands.\nBut apart from income and lifestyle differences, there are also cultural reasons for this divide. They show that Chinese people and Westerners have different perceptions of happiness.\nAccording to a survey conducted by CCTV, income levels most affected Chinese people's sense of well- being (55.5 percent), followed by health (48.9 percent) and quality of marriage or love life (32 percent).\nIt seems that all these criteria are lagging  in China, and that the obvious explanation for greater happiness in the West is higher incomes.\nBut not so, says Professor John Helliwell, an American economist at the University of British Columbia and coauthor of the UN report.\nAccording to Helliwell, low-income individuals may experience an initial jump in happiness when their money increases, but this feeling decreases as they adapt to their new circumstances. He stresses the example of the US, where, despite GDP figures rising consistently for the past 50 years, happiness has been steadily declining.\nThis is because people desire more than money and material wealth. \"To be happy, we need to feel connection, trust and meaningful relationships,\" explains Helliwell. \nDr Deborah Swallow, a UK expert on cultural diversity however, believes there are some differences in the perceptions of happiness in the West and China. \n\"For North Americans and Europeans, happiness tends to be defined in terms of personal achievement, and is best predicted by self-esteem\" she says.\n\"For East Asians, happiness tends to be defined in terms of interpersonal connectedness, and is best predicted by how well involved the self is in a social network.\"\nLiving standards are not necessarily the last word on happiness, as suggested by China's Urban Happiness Ranking 2012, released by the Hong Kong-based China Institute of City Competitiveness in July.\nAccording to the survey's results, Qingdao in Shandong province is China's happiest city with a score of 95.08.\nSurprisingly, China's first-tier cities scored  ly low, with Shenzhen ranking 94th, Beijing 96th and Shanghai in 99th position.", "id": "high16747.txt"}
