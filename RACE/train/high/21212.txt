We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.\"\nMale and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. \" Boys interpret  the world as objects moving through space,\" he says.\nThe male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class.\nThe female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention.\nBoys and girls also hear differently. \" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, \" says Chadwell. \" They think you're mad and can shut down. \" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited.\nA boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts  ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious.\nThese differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. \" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning.\"", "id": "high21212.txt"}
