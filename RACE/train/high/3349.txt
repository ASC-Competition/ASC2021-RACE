Some rely on assistants to set up and then describe the shots   , and others just point and shoot in the right place.\"Just like any good artists,\" says McCulloh.\"They have their unique ways of operating.\" One participating photographer is Pete Eckert, an artist with multiple degrees in design and sculpture who only turned to photography after losing his vision in the mid-1990s.He opens the shutter   on his camera and then uses flashlights, lights, and candles to paint his scene on film.A former fashion photographer in Chicago, Weston, lost his vision due to AIDS in 1996 and focuses on images of destruction and disability.His photos are also a star of the show.\nWhat do gallery-goers say? \"I was very impressed by it.The technique and experience was amazingly different,\" says John Hesketh, a printmaker in Anaheim.\"You never have a sense of feeling sorry for these people because they've worked very hard to prove their value.\"\nBeyond the praise, however, the exhibition also makes a great example for disabled people everywhere.That point was explained in early May during a discussion on the TV show.At the very end of the talk, one attendee expressed his opinion.\"This exhibition is extraordinary and revolutionary for many reasons.I think that by being an artist with a disability, you are continuing the work of those people who fought for basic civil rights to gain access and to have a voice.In that way, it's so wonderful that your photographs say it all.\"", "id": "high3349.txt"}
