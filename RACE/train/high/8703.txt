However, guidelines  for preparing a global resume are constantly changing. The best advice is to find out what is appropriate regarding the company culture, the country culture, and the culture of the person making the hiring decision. The following list is a good place to start.\n*In many countries, it is standard procedure to attach a photo or have your photo printed on your resume. Do not attach a photograph to your resume if you are sending it to the United States, though.\n*Educational requirements differ from country to country. In most cases of \"cross-border\" job hunting, just stating the title of your degree will not be enough. Provide the reader with details about your studies and any related experience.\n*Pay attention to the resume format  you use--chronological  or reverse-chronological order. If you find no specific guidelines, the general preference is for the reverse-chronological format, which means listing your current or most recent experience first.\n*The level of computer technology and accessibility to the Internet varies from country to country. Even if a company or individual lists an e-mail address, there is no guarantee that they will actually receive your email. Send a paper copy of your resume, as well as the emailed copy, just to make sure that it is received.\n*If you are writing your resume in English, find out if the receiver uses British English or American English because there are variations between the two versions.\n*Although English is widely accepted today as being the universal language of business, most multinational companies will expect you to speak the language of one of the countries in which they do business, in addition to English. Have your resume prepared in both languages, and be ready for your interview to be conducted in both languages. Most companies will want to see and hear proof of your language skills.\n*Be aware that paper sizes are different in different countries. The United States standard is 81/2 by 11 inches, while the European A4 standard is 21 by 29.7 centimeters. When you send your resume by email, reformat it to the receiver's standard. Otherwise, when it is printed out, half of your material may be missing!", "id": "high8703.txt"}
