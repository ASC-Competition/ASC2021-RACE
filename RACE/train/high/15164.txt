We'd dipped   hundreds of berries, arranged gift baskets and packaged orders to be shipped around the country.\nBy the end of the day, the two middle-aged women, Joan and I, were exhausted. Shari didn't seem tired. That was typical Shari. Though she was very busy, I'd seen her give away berries to everybody -- parking attendants, mail carriers and hairdressers. \"For me?\" they would say, bursting into a smile.\nAs a \"thank you\", Shari took us out for dinner. But there was a 45-minute wait at her favorite restaurant. \"No big deal. There's another place just up the road,\" she said, driving us there. This time we walked right in.\nWhen the waitress came to take our drink orders, Shari reached into her handbag, pulling something out. \"I want you to have these,\" she said, handing the waitress a box of chocolate-dipped strawberries. \"She will love those berries!\" I thought. But the waitress seemed _ . She only let out a \"thank you\" before grabbing the box and rushing into the kitchen.\nA few minutes later, the waitress returned with our iced tea. \"I apologize,\" she said. \"My best friend and I had promised to send each other something every Valentine's Day. But she passed away last year. I didn't know how I'd get through this day without her. Then you handed me that box.\"\"I'm so sorry to hear that,\" said Shari. \"It's not much, but I hope you can enjoy them.\"\"Oh, I will,\" the waitress said. \"See, every year we always sent each other the same thing; a box of chocolate-dipped strawberries bought from our favourite store, The Berry Factory.\"", "id": "high15164.txt"}
