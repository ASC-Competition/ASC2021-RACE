The last word in each of the lines of a poem does not have to have a rhyming sound, many of them do. Two lines of poetry that rhyme with each other at the end are call rhyming couplet.\nWriting rhyming poetry can be difficult because you need to choose words that not only rhyme but have meaning, too. Even though some poems are short, you have to think extra long at which words to choose. Here is an example of a short poem:\nHe was only a bug, but he was the king.\nShe smiled at him when he gave her a ring.\nHe forgot to be careful of one little thing.\nHis queen was a bee, and she could sting.", "id": "high7115.txt"}
