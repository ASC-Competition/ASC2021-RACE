Things will change soon.\nTo protect  the environment, supermarkets in China will stop providing   free plastic bags after June 1st. If you don't want to pay money to buy them, you'll have to bring your own shopping bag.\nWhat kind of bags will be the best to bring? Students in Kunming Xinying Middle School have some good ideas.\nRecently 54 students of the school held an activity in which they made their own environmentally-friendly shopping bags.\nMost students used old clothes to make their bags. They painted pictures like the Olympic rings on them.\nBut Wang Shuncheng, a Junior 2 boy, chose a different material  . He made his bag with old newspaper. Is a newspaper bag strong enough to hold shopping? Wang says it is, \"No problem. I put six bottles of water in the bag,\" he said. \"It's strong enough!\"\nChen Lisi, a girl, had a more traditional way to make her bag - she weaved   a bamboo basket. It was not an easy job. With her grandfather's help, Chen spent a whole afternoon making it. She also weaved wool   flowers on the basket.\nMaking bags was not all the students did. They had another job: to persuade their parents and relatives to use environmentally-friendly shopping bags instead of plastic ones. The school will show the bags so that shops and stores can get inspiration   from the students' work.", "id": "high2568.txt"}
