But why is it that some people could find their way across the Sahara  without a map, while others can lose themselves in the next street?\nScientists say we're all born with a sense of direction, but it is not properly understood how it works. One theory is that people with a good sense of direction have simply worked harder at developing it. Research being carried out at Liverpool University supports this idea and suggests that if we don't use it, we'll lose it.\n     \"Children as young as seven have the ability to find their way around,\" says Jim Martland, Research director of the project. \"However, if they are not allowed out alone or are taken everywhere by car, they never develop the skills.\"\nJim Martland also emphasizes that young people should be taught certain skills to improve their sense of direction. He makes the following suggestions:\nIf you are using a map, turn it so it relates to the way you are facing.\nIf you leave your bike in a strange place, put it near something like a big stone or a tree--something easy to recognize. Note landmarks on the route as you go away from your bike. When you return, go back along the same route.\nSimplify the way for finding your direction by using lines such as streets in a town, streams, or walls in the countryside to guide you. Count your steps so that you know how far you have gone and note any landmarks such as tower blocks or hills which can help to find out where you are.\nNow you will never get lost again!", "id": "high20519.txt"}
