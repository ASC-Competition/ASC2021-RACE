I haven't seen many of my classmates after we parted when the college entrance examination was over. So we decided to have a get-together party this summer vacation.\nAs you can imagine, I could hardly wait to have the day for our reunion. After several month's waiting, 25 of my former higher school classmates and 3 of our teachers were crowded in a small restaurant near our high school. We were more than happy to meet with each other again. Our former Chinese teacher was so excited that he even choked   to say some words. With gratitude, we thanked our teachers for their hard work; with great joy, we exchanged the happy things happening in each of our present colleges; We talked before someone shouted. \"Oh, it is 11:30 now.\" But no one would be the first to say goodbye to others .\nI shall always bear this unforgettable get-together in my mind. With time passing, I believe I will meet many new friends, but I think the friendship among high school classmates will be the purest and will be the most valuable thing to cherish.", "id": "high17337.txt"}
