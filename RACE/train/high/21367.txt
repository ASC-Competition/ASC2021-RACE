The survey found those who did not study through the night had a grade point average of 3.2 compared to 2.95 for those who have. \nThe study, by assistant professor of psychology Pamela Thacher, is to be included in the January issue of Behavioral Sleep Medicine. \"It's not a big difference, but it's pretty striking,\" Thacher said. \"I am primarily a sleep researcher and I know nobody thinks clearly at 4 in the morning. You think you do, but you can't.\" \nMany college students, of course, have inadequate or irregular sleep, for reasons ranging from excessive caffeine to poor time management. \n\"A lot of students were under the impression that all-nighters were a very useful tool for accomplishing work, that caffeine intake was very useful in meeting deadlines and stuff like that,\" said Chatani, who had a 3.4 grade point average last term. \nDr Howard Weiss, a physician at St. Peter's Sleep Center in Albany, said the study results make sense. \n\"Certainly that data is out there showing that short sleep duration  ly interferes with concentration, interferes with performance on objective testing,\" he said. \nSome night owls  do get good grades, of course, which may be explained by circadian rhythms , Weiss said. Some people have different 24-hour body clocks than others, and may do better depending on class and testing times, Weiss said.", "id": "high21367.txt"}
