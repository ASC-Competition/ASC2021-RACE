Stored inside were all kinds of treasure and precious stones. When he saw it, he _ the cave entrance and stayed there, guarding it.\nFrom that day on, the man hid all his valuables in the cave, and to avoid anyone suspecting he was rich, he gave up his job, his home, and his friends. He constantly watched the approaches to his cave, wanting no one to find out about it. Fearing thieves, he guarded the cave all night long.\nHe was so devoted to the cave that he hardly ate or drank. Before long, he fell ill. Many days passed, and he got thinner and sicker, losing all his strength. One day, when he could hardly move at all, he realized that it was his greed that had brought him to this extreme end. He understood that guarding his treasure had been of no use and no good. He decided to share it with others.\nHe crawled   into the cave to fetch some jewels, but discovered that the cave was almost empty. All he could find was a small emerald  . He took it and left the cave, intending to give it to the first person passing by. Soon a woman approached and accepted the emerald with great joy. The man said to her, \"I could have given you many more riches, but I don't know where they went. This is all I have now.\"\n\"Are you sure there's nothing else?\" replied the woman. The man shook his head and pointed to the cave. He found that some riches were still there; he saw some gold coins. He said, \"Take them with you.\" The woman took both the emerald and the coins, and went away happily.\nIn a while, an old man passed by and asked the man what he was doing there. The man replied, \"What bad luck! Just a moment ago I gave a woman the few riches left over from the treasure I was guarding.\"\n\"Are you sure there's nothing else?\" The old man asked him.\nThe man showed him the cave, and they found a box filled with jewels and gold. The man was shocked. The old man explained to him, \"At last! At last someone has freed himself from the spell   of this cave. You see, this is a magic cave, and you're the first to pass its great test. Many people have devoted their lives to this cave, only to end up realizing there's nothing here ...\"\n\"And why does this happen?\" said the man. \"Why does the treasure appear and disappear?\"\n\"My son, this magic cave has as many riches as does your own heart. When someone discovers it, the cave fills with the treasure they bring with them, but later, when they all devote themselves to guarding the treasure, their hearts begin emptying, and so does the cave. The only way to fill it is to fill your heart with all that is good, as you did by giving that last jewel to the woman. That's the reason why the cave was filling up again ...\"\nAnd so, the man understood it was better to share than to keep things to himself. And, from that day, thanks to the cave and the old man, the man became ever more noble   and generous.", "id": "high8589.txt"}
