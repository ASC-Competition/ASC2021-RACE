The \"Robonaut\" called R2 is intended to carry out maintenance tasks in the station's Destiny lab.\nNASA says it hopes that humanoid robots could one day stand in for astronauts during spacewalks or perform tasks too difficult or dangerous for humans.\nFor now, the $2.5 million NASA robot is limited to activities within the lab.", "id": "high14688.txt"}
