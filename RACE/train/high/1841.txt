They cannot even understand rhythm  .\"\"Nobody wants to pay musicians anything. I'm sick of all the people who want you to play without paying you.\"...\nOne younger musician said, \"There are a couple of clubs who want me to play for a few nights a month, and I'm trying to find other places to play. I'm also planning to join in several summer festivals this year.\"\nI really liked what the younger musician said so I made friends with him. Attitudes are important. Whether they're positive or negative  , they're all rubbing off on you. If you're around people who are always complaining or blaming   others, it is possible that you will start doing the same as well. If you spend lots of time with people who don't support your dreams, it is time to take a look at the people you call \"friends\".\nThere is an easy exercise you can try. Make a list of the people who you often stay with, and simply stop spending time with the negative people on your list. Set a new standard for yourself and don't become friends with people who fall below that standard. The choice is always yours to make. Of course, this exercise is entirely different from making friends only for the good of oneself. We really should try to help and spend time with those who are working towards a goal or dream.", "id": "high1841.txt"}
