Their daily catch would define the life of their own and their families. But it only took a few hours to remove their life-long habitat right in front of their eyes.\nSome fishermen had set sail on Christmas night. A very few were lucky enough to return the next morning. But none found any of what they left behind the other night. They were made to lose their families by the very waters that they used to love the most.\nThe few who made it through the day have been wondering about the meaning of their lives. They had used the sea for decades, but the sea used them for a single day. Is it justice ? Or killing? What would become of them? For whom would they go fishing again? As they struggle with their conflicting feelings, they also come to remind themselves of their struggle for survival.\nWhere are they now? They didn't leave the beach, or the sea. They will be back because the sea is their home and the only means of living, so they will continue in their fight for destiny .\nBut will it be the same? Sadly not. Even though they force themselves to forgive, they can't forget. They will never be able to get through the idea of  _ turning against them. That fear would always run deep in their hearts. As the fishermen get ready to take on their duties once again, each would take with them a frightful story that reminds them of the day of betrayal , the day that rewrote their lives.", "id": "high18635.txt"}
