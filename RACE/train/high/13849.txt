It attracts over 130,000 people every year, who join in the three-day party to celebrate the summer solstice, the longest day of the year.\nGlastonbury Festival has been held on Worthy Farm in Somerset since 1970. This year, all sorts of singers and bands were there, from the likes of Beyonce, Jessie J, to my favorite -- Paolo Nutini, who I really wish I could have met!\nWe drove straight in to one of the muddiest   Glastonbury Festivals ever! We came to our camp site, carrying enough clothes for a weekend of extreme weather conditions, and spent an hour or so putting up the tent. On the second day it began to rain and didn't stop for the rest of the day. We sat in the tent waiting for it to stop, and after several hours we realized that it wouldn't. When the need for food became too strong we put on boots and raincoats and made our way across many muddy fields.\nThere is something for everyone at the festival -- my favourite place is the Circus Field, which is full of interactive   performances. Also, I love the Kidz Field, where famous CBBC stars perform, and where you can get your face painted then run around on a climbing frame   with dragons.", "id": "high13849.txt"}
