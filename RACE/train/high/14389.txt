I am the sign of life and hope. I was chosen for grass, trees and leaves. Look over the countryside and you will see that I am in the majority.\"\nBlue interrupted, \"You only think about the earth, but consider the sky and the sea. It is the water that is the basis of life.\"\nYellow chuckled . \"The sun is yellow, as well as the moon and the stars. Every time you look at a sunflower, the whole world starts to smile.\"\nRed could bear it no longer. \"I am the ruler of all of you. I am blood-life's blood! I am the color of danger and bravery. I bring fire into the blood. I am the color of passion and love.\"\nPurple stood at his full height. \"I am the color of royalty  and power. I am the sign of authority   and wisdom.

You need me for balance and contrast , for prayer and inner peace.\"\nThe colors went on boasting , each showing off his or her own advantages. Suddenlythere came a flash of bright lightening. Thunder rolled and boomed. Rain started to pour down. The colors were scared to death.\nIn the midst of the quarrelling, rain began to speak, \"You foolish colors. Don't you know that you were each made for a special purpose, unique and different?
