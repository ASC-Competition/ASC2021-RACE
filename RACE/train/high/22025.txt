Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife.\nThe final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: \" Are you standing or sitting?\"\nThe host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words.\nRegardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story.

Finally a familiar voice came from the other end...\n\"So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?' He was actually worried about me, wondering how I felt at the news. He was afraid I would have fallen flat onto the ground.
