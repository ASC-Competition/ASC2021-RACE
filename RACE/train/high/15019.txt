Still, I had promised, and so I drove there. When I finally walked\ninto Carolyn's house and hugged and greeted my grandchildren, I said, \"Forget the daffodils, Carolyn! Theroad is invisible   in the cloud and fog, and there is nothing in the world except you and thesechildren that I want to see!\"\nMy daughter smiled calmly and said, \"We drive in this weather all the time, Mum. You will never forgive\nyourself if you miss this experience.\"\nAfter about twenty minutes, we turned onto a small road and I saw a small church. On the far side of the church, I saw a hand-lettered sign that read \"Daffodil Garden\"?We got out of the car and each took a child's hand, and I followed Carolyn down the path. Then, we turned a comer of the path, and I looked up amazed. Before me lay the most beautiful sight. Flows of flowers of different colors seemed poured down the peak and slopes. There were five acres of flowers! A seas of daffodil! It was like a fairyland all beyond description.\n\"But who has done this?\" I asked Carolyn. \"It's just one woman,\" Carolyn answered. That's her home, \"Carolyn pointed to a well-kept A-frame house that looked small and modest in the midst of all that glory. We walked up to the house. On the patio  , we saw a poster.\" Answers to the Questions I KnowYou Are Asking\" was the headline.\nThe first answer was a simple one. \"50,000 bulbs  \" it read. The second answer was, \"One at a time,by one woman.\" The third answer was, \"Began in 1958.\"\nI thought of this woman whom I Had never met, who, more than fifty years before, had begun-one bulb\nat a time-to bring the beauty and joy to the mountain top. Just planting one bulb at a time, year after year, had changed the world where she lived and created something of magnificence, beauty, and inspiration.\nWhen we multiply tiny pieces of time with small amounts of daily effort, we too can accomplish great things. Everyone can do something to change the world.", "id": "high15019.txt"}
