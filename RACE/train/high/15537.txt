I also helped to clean up the tables when it was very busy. One night, just before  Christmas, I found a large black wallet on the floor near one of the tables. I guessed I should check it to find out who was the owner, but I was very busy at the time. And I imagined that if there was something valuable  in the wallet, the   owner would be back. Sure enough, an hour later a man came up to the counter   and asked if anyone had found a wallet. I asked him to describe the lost wallet, and after he described it exactly, I gave him the wallet. He expressed his thanks when I handed it to him. He asked me if I had opened it, and when I told him \"no\". At  once he opened it and showed that it had nearly $ 800 in cash . He took out a twenty-dollar bill and handed it to me and I was amazed at this. \"A reward  for your honesty,\" he said and then turned and walked away.\nThinking about it later, I began wondering whether I would have been honest if I had known what was in the wallet! I thought that if I had no way to find the   owner and no one returned to get it, I might keep it. But it also came into my    mind that I actually saved someone's Christmas plans by finding and returning the wallet. The good feeling it gave me was worth more than anything could buy.", "id": "high15537.txt"}
