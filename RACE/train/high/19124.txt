The inspiration for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and after visits to the Philippines, where she saw the need for a battery-free flashlight. A friend at school there failed in her studies because of a lack of electricity and light to study when it became dark.\nIn her project, Ann wrote that she \"made two flashlights that do not use any batteries, harmful chemicals, or kinetic energy  . They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight's only limitation is its need for at least a 5degC temperature difference to provide usable light.\"\nA You Tube video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been viewed more than 1.4 million times.\nDespite her success, the private school student is undecided about her career path. Ann hopes she can find a way to combine her love of film with science.\nThe four winners were chosen from 15 finalists from eight countries. The contest attracted thousands of entries from students in 120 countries.", "id": "high19124.txt"}
