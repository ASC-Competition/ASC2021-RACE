That's a good philosophy. If they're headed somewhere and you try to stop them; they'll look for another way.\nThey'll climb over, they'll climb under, and they'll climb around. They keep looking for another way. What a neat philosophy, to never quit looking for a way to get where you're supposed to go.\nSecond, ants think winter all summer. That's an important viewpoint. You can't be so naive ( ) as to think summer will last forever. So ants are gathering in their winter food in the middle of summer.\nAn ancient story says, \"Don't build your house on the sand in the summer. \" Why do we need that advice.'? Because it is important to be realistic. In the summer, you've got to think storm. You've got to think rocks as you enjoy the sand and sun. Think ahead.\nThe third part of the ant philosophy is that ants think summer all winter. That is so important. During the winter, ants remind themselves, \"This won't last long ; we'll soon be out of here. \" And on the first warm day, the ants are out. If it turns cold again, they'll dive back down, but then they come out on the first warm day. They can't wait to get out.\nAnd here's the last part of the ant-philosophy. How much will an ant gather during the summer to prepare for the winter? All he possibly can. What an incredible philosophy, the \"all-you-possibly-can\" philosophy.\nWow, what a great seminar to attend -- the ant seminar. Never give up, look ahead, stay positive and do all you can.", "id": "high2830.txt"}
