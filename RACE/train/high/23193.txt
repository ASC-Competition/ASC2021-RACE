Some 5,000 birds mysteriously fell from the sky in Beebe, Arkansas after dark on New Year's Eve. \"The birds suffered from acute physical injuries leading to internal hemorrhage  and death. There was no sign of infectious disease,\" the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission said in a statement. The birds were otherwise healthy, it said.\nOne theory is that birds were frightened by New Year's fireworks and flew into buildings or other objects. \"Loud noises were reported shortly before the birds began to fall from the sky,\" the statement said, adding that blackbirds have poor night vision and seldom fly at night.\nAnother theory was that severe weather such as lightning accounted for the loud noises but this was  _ because the violent weather had already left the area. \"We're leaning more toward a stress event,\" said Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens.\nThe commission also is trying to determine what caused the deaths of up to 100,000 fish over a 20-mile stretch of the Arkansas River near a dam in Ozark, 125 miles west of Beebe. The fish were discovered on December 30. Stephens said the commission expected results on the fish tests in probably a month. Since almost all the fish were one species -- bottom-feeding drum, Stephens said, the test was very important. Stephens also said: \"The events do not appear related.\" Both that section of the river and the air at the site of the bird deaths were tested for toxins . Beebe is a town of about 4,500 people located 30 miles northeast of the state capital.", "id": "high23193.txt"}
