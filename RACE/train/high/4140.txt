It's brief: three or four words per exchange. It takes wit, concentration, and quick fingers.\nAnd it requires tremendous linguistic economy. There's neither time nor space for explanations. Why consume precious key-strokes telling six friends you have to leave for a moment to take care of your little brother when BRB(=\"be\" right back) will do? Want to enter a conversation? Just type PMFJI(=\"pardon\" me for jumping in).  Interested in whom you're talking to? Type A/S/L, the nearly universal request to know your pal's age, sex and location. You may get 15/M/NY as a response from your pal.\nIf something makes you laugh, say you're OTF(=\"on\" the floor),or LOL(=\"laughing\" out loud),or combine the two into ROTFL(=\"rolling\" on the floor laughing).\nAnd when it's time to get back to work or go to bed, you type GTG(=\"got\" to go) or TTYL(talk to you later).\nPeople want to write as fast as possible, and they want to get their ideas across as quickly as they can. Capital letters are left in the dust, except when expressing emotion, as it takes more time to hold down the \"shift\" key and capitals. Punctuation is going, too.", "id": "high4140.txt"}
