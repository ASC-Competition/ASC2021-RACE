However, scientific studies seem to have concluded that hypnosis is not only a true kind of treatment but also highly effective. There have been a number of controlled studies in recent decades and they all seem to agree hypnosis most definitely does work. Within this essay I will discuss just two of many studies about hypnosis and how they show that hypnosis works.\n              In a study released in the Journal of Clinical Psychology to test the helpfulness of hypnosis in losing weight, 109 volunteers (ranging from the age of 17 to 67) completed a behavioral treatment either with or without the addition of hypnosis. The treatment took nine weeks and during return check-ups both eight months and two years after the treatment the people who used hypnosis showed a continued weight loss rate much higher than the people who didn't. Those who used hypnosis were much better at achieving their ideal weight goals.\n              In 2009, researchers at Hull University found that hypnosis had an influence on brain scans. This shows that hypnosis had an influence on brain activity that can be picked up on brain scans. This shows that hypnosis is not just a placebo treatment   as some doubters claim it is. \"Our study shows hypnosis is real,\" said British psychologist Dr. Michael Heap who was involved in the study. This piece of research shows that hypnosis works and also exactly how it works.\n              There are also studies proving that hypnosis works for pain relief, improving skin quality, improving confidence as well as helping with many other problems. If you've ever thought about using hypnosis but were not sure whether it would work for you, you should now have all the proof you need to use hypnosis with confidence.", "id": "high23741.txt"}
