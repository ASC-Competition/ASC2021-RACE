P. Seligman in the journal Psychological Science.\nSolid social relationships do not promise happiness, but they are an important contributing factor. The very happy people whom the authors studied all said they had good quality social relationships. However, the authors write, there is no single key to high happiness. \"High happiness seems to be like beautiful symphonic music--including many instruments, without any one being enough for the beautiful quality.\"\nDiener regards happiness as \"subjective   wellbeing\"--in other words, the person evaluates his or her own quality of life. The question to ask is, \"Is my life going well, according to the standards I choose to use?\" If the answer is \"yes\", then that person is judged to be happy.\nBecause people evaluate their lives based on happiness, subjective wellbeing is very important. Though necessary, it is not enough for having a good life. \"Subjective wellbeing seems quite necessary for the 'good society', although it is not enough for that society because there are other things we also value and would want in such a place.\" says Diener.\nCan subjective wellbeing be measured scientificall? Diener points out three parts contributing to happiness: pleasant emotions and moods, lack of negative emotions and moods, and satisfaction judgment, to which other factors including cheerfulness and feelings of fulfillment may be added.\nThere is no magic formula for happiness. Diener suggests steps you can take to ensure you are as happy as you can be. Surrounding yourself with good friends and family--people who care about you and whom you care about--is a start. Joining in activities you enjoy and value is also important; whether it's work or play, keeping busy in an environment enjoyable to you will contribute much to your subjective wellbeing. In addition, a healthy outlook is necessary.", "id": "high8965.txt"}
