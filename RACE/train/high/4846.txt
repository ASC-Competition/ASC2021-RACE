Our data suggests embarrassment is a good thing, not something you should fight.\"said Matthew Feinberg, who led the study.\nWhile the most typical gesture of embarrassment is a downward gaze to one side while partly covering the face, a person who feels shame, as distinguished  from embarrassment, will typically cover the whole face, Feinberg said.\nThe results were got from a series of experiments. In the first experiment, 60 college students were videotaped describing embarrassing moments, such as making incorrect assumptions  based on appearances. The college students also participated in the \"Dictator Game\" which is used in economics research to measure altruism . For example, each was given 10 raffle tickets  and asked to keep a share of the tickets and give the reminder  to a partner.\nThe findings, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, showed that those who showed greater levels of embarrassment tended to give away more of their raffle tickets, indicating(=showing) greater generosity.", "id": "high4846.txt"}
