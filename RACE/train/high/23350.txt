Glass, director of the National Museum of American History said in a statement.\nThe message, which was engraved by an Irish immigrant and watchmaker named Jonathan Dillon, is dated April 13, 1861, and reads in part: \"FortSumpter[sic] was attacked by the rebels\" and \"thank God we have a government.\"\n\"It's a personal side of history about an ordinary watchman being inspired to record something for  _ ,\" Glass said.\nThe museum decided to open the watch after being contacted by the watchmaker's great-great-grandson, Doug Stiles, who had received a letter from a   in Ireland. It said that the family had found a letter Dillon had written about the purported   message in the watch.\nThen Stiles, a 57 -year-old real estate lawyer in Waukegan,Illinois, searched on the Internet and found a New York Times article from 1906, where Dillon told the story at the age of 84.\nDuring the interview, Dillon said that he unscrewed the dial of the watch and wrote on the metal as soon as he heard the news about the first shot of the Civil War. \"The first gun is fired. Slavery is dead. Thank God we have a President who at least will try.\"\nHowever, the actual message that the museum found is different from what Dillon recalled. It reads, \"Jonathan Dillon, April 13-1861, Fort Sumpter [sic] was attacked by the rebels on the above date J Dillon, April 13 -1861, Washington, thank God we have a government, Jonth Dillon.\"", "id": "high23350.txt"}
