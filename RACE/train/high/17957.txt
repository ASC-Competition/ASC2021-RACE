Then like playing computer games rather than \ncleaning the rooms. But in Australia, Jim and Robert's mother, Mrs Black, has a good and proper method to get their children to do housework.\nHere is an example.\n   \"Mum, have you worked out next week's housework? Let Jim and me choose the cards. I can't wait. It's fun! \"\n   When Robert shouted out, his mother had already put all the cards on their big table. On the \ncards, there are some words like these, \" sweep the floor, clean your bedroom, help mum cook, \nwash vegetables, make beds, feed the fish, cut the wood, clean the bathroom \" and many others. Jim and Robert chose two cards for each day from Monday to Friday. Then they would hang \nthem on the weekday task board. Jim likes to clean the bathroom, so he picked up the card \"clean \nthe bathroom \". Robert loves to make the bed so he picked up his favorite card. Jim again picked \nup \"wash vegetables\" and Robert chose \" feed the fish \". Soon the two boys were happy to take \naway all the cards. \nTo help the children do housework, their mother thought hard and came up with this idea. Of \ncourse, the couple did the housework on the weekends and left Jim and Robert two days free.", "id": "high17957.txt"}
