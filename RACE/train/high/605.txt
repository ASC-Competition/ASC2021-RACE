This could end the worries of many parents fearful for their children's safety on the roads.\nUntil now the local government have only been prepared to provide bus services for children living more than three miles from their school, or sometimes less if special reasons existed.Now it has been decided that if a group of parents ask for help in organizing transport they will be prepared to go ahead, as long as the arrangement will not lose money and children taking part will be attending their nearest school.\nThe new plan is to be tried out this term for children living at Milton who attend Impington School.The children live just within the three-mile limit and the local government have said in the past that they will not agree to provide free transport to the school.But now they have agreed to offer a sum of money for a bus service from Milton to Impington and back, a plan which has the support of the school's headmaster.\nBetween 50 and 60 parents have said they would like their children to take part.Final calculations have still to be carried out, but a government official has said the cost to parents should be less than PS20 a term.\nThey have been able to arrange the service at a low cost because there is already an agreement with the bus company for a bus to take children who live further away to Impington.The same bus would now just make one more journey to pick up the Milton children.The official said they would get in touch with other groups of parents who in the past had asked if transport could be provided for their children, to see if they would like to take part in the new plan.", "id": "high605.txt"}
