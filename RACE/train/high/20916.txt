In each pair, the \"director\" had to communicate the identity of one of the 24 shapes. The partner had to use the information to choose the correct shape from a set of three images on a computer monitor.\nHalf of the partners studied only the first six shapes, while the others learned the first 18 shapes. The directors, who had memorized all the shapes, were aware of their partners' knowledge levels of the shapes.\nIn the pairs with the most shared knowledge, the directors were more likely to rattle off  shape names, compared with pairs with little knowledge overlap , in which the directors were more likely to describe the actual shapes. Not surprisingly, participants with more shared knowledge were twice as likely to ask for clarification as those with less overlap.\nLanguage itself can be confusing. \"The reason all this is happening at all is that language in general is ambiguous,\" said Keysar.\nHe recalls an ambiguous billboard near a stadium holding a Rolling Stones concert that night. The billboard read, \"Avoid LSD tonight.\" (:LSD\"\")\nHmmm? \"It was about Lake Shore Drive, and I'm sure the writer of the sign didn't realize he was being ambiguous,\" Keysar said.\n\"Even though miscommunication can lead to missed meetings or deadlines, people are often unaware when their language is ambiguous,\" Keysar added, \"We don't realize we say things that are ambiguous,\" he said, \"and that's a problem.\"", "id": "high20916.txt"}
