But water also can be dangerous for kids if you don't take great care. Nearly 1,000 kids die each year by drowning.\nHere are some tips to keep your kids safe in the water:\nAt the Lake or Pond\n*Don't let little kids swim alone without adult supervision-- lakes or ponds may be shallow near the bank and are suddenly deep sharply further out from shore.\n*Ponds and lakes may hide jagged rocks, broken glass, or rubbish.\n*Make sure kids wear foot protection; even in the water, they should wear socks or water shoes.\n*Watch out for weeds and grass in the water that could trap a leg or arm.\n*Most boating accidents, particularly among teenagers, are related to alcohol . Be sure teens know about the dangers of alcohol, on and off the water.\nAt the Beach\n*Teach kids to always swim when and where a lifeguard is on duty. Unlike the calm waters of a swimming pool, the beach has special dangers like currents and tides . Check with the lifeguard when you arrive to find out about the water conditions.\n*Tell kids never to stand with their back to the water because a sudden wave can easily knock a child over.\n*Teach kids that if they're caught in a dangerous wave, they should swim parallel  to the shore or should tread  water and call for a lifeguard's help.\nWhether at the lake or at the beach, teach your child to get out of the water during bad weather, especially lightning.", "id": "high2555.txt"}
