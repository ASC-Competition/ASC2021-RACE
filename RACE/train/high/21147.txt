He ordered the guards, Month and Year, to let him approach his father's throne. As the doors opened slowly, the sun's rays almost blinded him. Phaethon protected his eyes and felt his way toward Apollo's throne. \"Come here, my son. Follow my voice,\" Apollo's voice echoed. \"What is so urgent that you have my guards hurrying to do your bidding?\" \n          \"Father, I have a problem. All of my friends have been teasing me. They don't believe that you're my father or that you make the sun rise and set,\" complained Phaethon.\n     Apollo replied, \"Oh? That problem again? Well, just to prove it to your friends once and for all, I will satisfy any wish you desire.\" \n          \"Really? Then I have only one wish,\" answered Phaethon. \"I'd like to drive your chariot and make the sun rise tomorrow morning!\" \n     Apollo was horrified. \"No, not that! No one but me can drive the chariot. The horses are too powerful!\"\n     \"You said I could have anything,\" murmured Phaethon.\n     Bound by his promise, Apollo had to agree. His heart was sick with worry as he ordered Dawn to prepare the horses, Hour and Day, to the Golden Chariot. Phaethon could hardly wait to jump in the driver's seat and take the reins . He hoped all his friends were watching the sky and waiting for him through the stars. \n    \"Wait, my son! There are things you need to know!\" cried Apollo. \n\"Oh, Father! You worry too much. I've often seen you drive. I know what to do,\" Phaethon answered. \n         Apollo hurried to give directions. \"You have never driven my chariot before. You must make the horses stay on the path. If you are too low, you will  _ the earth and large land on it could be thrown into a world of fire.\"\n          \"I know, Father. Now watch me take off!\" shouted Phaethon. \n     Dawn stepped back and released the horses go. The horses were filled with excitement. The sky begged for Dawn's light, so she ran toward the horizon to make the darkness fade. As Phaethon was about to get on, Apollo took him by the arm and said, \"Please listen to me! If you go too high, you will warm the cold depths of the heavens, and the Bear or Snake or the Scorpion   will come alive!\"\n         Phaethon just laughed. \"My friends are waiting. I've got to go!\" he shouted. \n         With that, the chariot was off. It was a wild ride. Hour and Day were difficult to control. Phaethon did not have his father's strong arms or years of experience. The horses wove from side to side and jumped up and down through the heavens, hitting everything in their way. The sun bounced along behind the chariot like a basketball. It scratched the stars and slipped along mountaintops, leaving burnt remains behind. Phaethon's friends ran for cover as they watched. Just as his father had warned him, the figures in the sky began to move. Suddenly the Scorpion appeared suddenly before him, but Phaethon dashed by in time. The Snake struck out and bit a wheel off the chariot. \n     Apollo, seeing the destruction, rushed up toward the heavens, but he was too late! The Bear had waken up from his icy hibernation and seized Phaethon before his father could reach him. Apollo took hold of the reins and finally regained control of Hour and Day, but it was years before the earth's mountaintops were white with snow again. The scorched areas became deserts where very little would grow. Phaethon became a part of the stars alongside the Bear, where his father could regretfully keep an eye on him.", "id": "high21147.txt"}
