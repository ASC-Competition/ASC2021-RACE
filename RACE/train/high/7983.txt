Among them are British, French, Argentineans and Japanese, as well as locals.\nOn the bell of noon the signal was given and for the next 60 minutes participants   _ tomatoes at each other until a gunshot signalled the end of the festival.\nThe clean-up followed, with fighters washing the signs of battle away in the local river or under hundreds of temporary   showers. While the front of buildings were watered, they seemed brighter than ever after their bath.\nThe Tomatina, held on the last Wednesday in August, is said to be the world's largest tomato fight.
