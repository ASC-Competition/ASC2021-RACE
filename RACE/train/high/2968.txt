It could be minus 20 degrees centigrade and there'd be Dad, removing snow, or perhaps chopping some wood --- his coat thrown  aside--- wearing a shirt , a cap, and a pair of gloves.\n\"Aren't you cold, Dad?\" I'd ask. \"No,\" Dad would reply. \"I'm not cold--- working too hard to be cold.\"\nMany times I wondered whether my father was an extremely tough man, or whether he was foolish.\nOne time when I was quite young, perhaps five or so, I went ice fishing with Dad. It was a bright, clear day--and bitterly cold.\nAfter we'd been out on the ice for a little while, my feet started getting cold.\n\"Daddy, my feet are cold.\" I said.\n\"Yeah, it's cold out here today,\" he replied.\n\"Tell you what,\" he said. \"Walk around. Make some circles in the snow. See how many different patterns you can make. That will get your feet warm.\"\nNow, I was just a little girl at the time but I remember thinking, \"How in the world will walking around in the snow make my feet warm? Dad must be out of mind.\nBut he was my father, after all. I made circles in the snow. I made squares. Pretty soon I was having so much fun making patterns in the snow. I forgot about my feet being cold.\nNow, all these years later, I know, too, from personal experience how my father was able to take his coat off and work outside in the winter wearing just a shirt, a cap and gloves. Because I do it, too. \"Aren't you cold?\" my husband asked one winter day. \"No,\" I replied. \"I'm not cold--working too hard to be cold.\"\nI hope my husband has decided I'm both tough and smart. But I guess quite a bit of the time he thinks I'm foolish.\nWherever Dad is in that great big farm in the sky--I'm sure he can't help but smile whenever I take my coat off while I'm working outside in the winter.", "id": "high2968.txt"}
