In order to have friends, you have to be a friend. But how can you be a good friend at school?\nListen----Listen when they are talking. Don't say anything unless they ask you a question.

You should try to put them first, but make sure you don't do everything they want you to do. Try to take an extra pencil or pen with you to classes in case they forget one.
