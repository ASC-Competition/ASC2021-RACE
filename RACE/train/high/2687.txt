I hoped one of the packages that held a camera had already been placed under the Christmas tree. It was the only thing I wanted. I had been _ to my parents. I love taking photos. My bedroom walls are covered with photos I had taken with my mom's old camera. I'm always trying to capture   those perfect moments in which you can hear the laughter or touch the beautiful scene, but my camera has always seemed to fall short.\nI knew Mom had put a few presents under the tree this morning, so I went on a hunt in my mom's room. I opened the door and found my Christmas present was lying unwrapped on the floor -- a big pink cat. I felt so disappointed.\nMom seemed to notice that, and she tried to cheer me up. \"Stacy, I got your present today. I am so excited to surprise you!\" \"I can't wait,\" I said.\nThe next day I couldn't wait any longer. I needed to tell her.\n\"Mom, may I talk to you for a second?\"\n\"Sure, dear. What do you need to talk about?\" she asked.\nAnd so it came -- how upset I was that I was getting a cat.\n\"Stacy, that cat is for your sister Julia!\" she said with a smile.\n\"Then what am I getting?\" I asked.\nShe just smiled. \"You'll have to wait and see.\"\nNext morning, I happily got into the living room and sat next to the tree. I pulled out the box with my name on it and opened the wrapping paper to find ...\nMy camera! \"Thank you!\" I said to both Dad and Mom.\nDad picked up the camera and took a picture of Julia, Mom and me. It has become one of my favorite pictures. Just on that Christmas morning, I took lots of photos with my camera -- my little sister making a face, my parents giving me a soft smile -- and all of these photos have come to mean one thing to me: love.", "id": "high2687.txt"}
