Let that   string pull you up as straight as possible. Relax your shoulders.\n  * Look ahead. Keep your neck straight and your head held high to avoid unnecessary strain to your neck and shoulders. If you have to look down to see where you're going, lower your eyes, not your head.\n  * Move your arms. Bend your elbows and let your arms swing naturally at your sides. You'll burn up to 15 percent more calories by keeping your arms moving.\n^Stay safe walking is one of the safest activities you can do.

Wear a comfortable elastic bandage  for support, and keep your eyes focused on the path.", "id": "high21707.txt"}
