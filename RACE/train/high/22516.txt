Suddenly he saw Seth, a lazy, good-for-nothing fellow grab a pound of fresh butter and concealed it in his hat. No sooner had the storekeeper seen the act than he hit upon exactly the right revenge. He would punish the thief, and satisfy his own appetite for fun.\nSeth had his hat on his head, and the butter in his hat. He was anxious to leave. However, the rightful owner of the butter offered him a cup of hot drink, took him by the shoulders and planted him in a seat close to the stove. The grocer stuffed in the stove as many sticks of wood as he could possibly fit inside.\nSeth already could feel the butter settling down closer to his hair, so he jumped up, declaring that he must go.\n\"Sit down; don' t be in such a hurry,\" replied the grocer, pushing him back into the chair again.\nStreak after streak of the butter came pouring from under the poor man's hat. The fun-loving grocer kept on stuffing wood into the stove. Then, as if surprised, he remarked, \"You seem to be perspiring as if you were warm! Let me put your hat away for you.\"\n\"No!\" exclaimed poor Seth at last, unable to stand it a moment longer. \"No, I must go; let me out.\"\nA greasy waterfall of butter was now pouring down the poor man's face and neck, soaking into his clothes, and trickling down his body into his boots. He was bathed in oil from head to toe.\nJust as his victim darted out the door, the grocer said, \"I reckon the fun I've had out of you is worth the money, so I shan't charge you for that pound of butter in your hat.\"", "id": "high22516.txt"}
