Some supermarkets have started marketing \"odd shapes and sizes\" of fruit and vegetables, though.\nAlso, more UK consumers are prepared to accept \"ugly\" fruit and vegetables, amid concerns over sustainability  and food prices, the research said.\nIn developing countries, much of the loss of food occurs during post-harvesting storage, processing and packaging.\nTackling waste globally is necessary to feed a growing world population sustainably. One in eight people worldwide doesn't have enough food, the report said.\nAround a third of food produced globally is lost or wasted.\nProfessor Tim Benton, an expert on food security at the University of Leeds, said: \"Over 5 million people in the UK live in poverty, where basic food provision is a daily challenge.\"\nNearly 400,000 people used food banks last year, according to the Trussell Trust.\n\"At the same time, 15 million tons of food is wasted annually, with nearly half thrown away within UK households. Reducing the scale  of losses and waste throughout the food system is a crucial step.\"\nThe report highlights priorities  for research to help reduce food waste, including improving harvesting and packaging technologies and seasonal weather prediction.", "id": "high16232.txt"}
