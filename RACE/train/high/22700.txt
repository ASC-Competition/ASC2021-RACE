Kids will feel like they are not good enough, or that you don't care, and may see no sense in reaching for their success.\nSo what's the right amount of praise? Experts say that the quality of praise is more important than the quantity: if praise is sincere and genuine, and focused on the effort, not the outcome, you can give it as often as your child does something that is worth a reward.", "id": "high22700.txt"}
