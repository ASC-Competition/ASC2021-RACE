AOL Instant Messaging, MSN, Gmail, Facebook, Myspace -- I've got it all under control. I thought there was nothing more to it besides checking my e-mail and wasting my time, until I was introduced to electronic commerce(e-commerce): business on the Internet.\nSome online businesses are run from one-room home offices. Others have hundreds of employees   across the world. Have you ever heard of Amazon.com, Yahoo.com?\nMy friends often said they got cheap textbooks off Amazon.com, or had a good deal   on Steve Madden shoes that were on sale at SteveMaden.com. Unfortunately for me, I continued my \"e-commerceless\" Web-surfing, not knowing about all the deals I was missing out on.\nThat is, of course, until my sister finally sold the idea to me.\n\"Why are all these packages arriving in the mail for you, Katy?\" I asked her one day. Strange envelopes   had been put on our doorstep for weeks now, each one always addressed to my sister; and we all know little sisters should never be getting more mail than their elders!\n\"Oh, it's the things I ordered online!\" she answered. I watched speechlessly as she opened them. There was no way our parents were letting her spend that much money- online or off!\n\"How much did all of this coat?\"\n\"Oh, only about $15 in all!\" She said excitedly. \"Everything on eBay is on sale! It's a way better than going to the mall.\"\nI felt as if there had been a store right in my backyard that I had never walked into! That week, I ordered a used Spanish textbook for my summer course online for 10 percent of the publishing price. A few days later, I bought an iPod protector and a book or two via the wonderful eBay.com.", "id": "high898.txt"}
