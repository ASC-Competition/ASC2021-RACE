But the research has found laptop users are less able to remember and apply the concepts they have been taught.\nResearchers performed experiments that aimed to find out whether using a laptop increased the tendency to make notes \"mindlessly\" by taking down word for word what the professors said.\nIn the first experiment, students were given either a laptop or pen and paper. They listened to the same lectures and were told to use their usual note-taking skills. Thirty minutes after the talk, they were examined on their ability to remember facts and on how well they understood concepts.\nThe researchers found that laptop users took twice as many notes as those who wrote by hand. However, the typists performed worse at remembering and applying the concepts. Both groups scored similarly when it came to memorizing facts.\nThe researchers' report said, \"While more notes are beneficial, if the notes are taken mindlessly, as is more likely the case on a laptop, the benefit disappears.\"\nIn another experiment aimed at testing long-term memory, students took notes as before but were tested a week after the lecture. This time, the students who wrote notes by hand performed significantly better on the exam.\nThese two experiments suggest that handwritten notes are not only better for immediate learning and understanding, but that they also lead to superior revision in the future.", "id": "high8741.txt"}
