The program will include 37 vendors with both classic and contemporary dolls for sale.\n\"Timeless Treasures is a club that's open to doll lovers regardless of the age of the doll,\" said Judy Smith, president of the organization. \"Some doll clubs require members have a certain number of antique dolls, but we don't. we make sure we are not terribly formal.\"\nSmith, 71, is a retired schoolteacher who owns Judy's Doll Hospital, a part-time business she operates out of her home.
