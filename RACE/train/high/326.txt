Mrs.Phillips used then to tell us:\"Her Ladyship ran into the back of a milk-cart yesterday;but it wasn't much hurt\";or\"A policeman stopped her Ladyship because she was on the wrong side of the road;but she said she didn't know what the white Line on the road meant,so he explained arld Let her go on.\"Mrs.Phillips must have had an excellent Intelligence Service at her command,for the stories were always true enough.", "id": "high326.txt"}
