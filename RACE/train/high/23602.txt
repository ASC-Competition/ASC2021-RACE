The students , mostly from majors such as business management or international trade , will finish there driving courses within 20 days or so .Training costs have dropped to ,2,600yuan for students , according to the Haidian Driving School in Beijing . The price is not really low , but students will accept it , seeing it as an investment   in their future . Familiarity with the operation of computers and fluent English are the basic skills graduating students need to find a job . But a driver's permit has become another factor. \n\"In the job market , owning a driver's permit sometimes strengthens a graduating student's competitiveness for a good position ,\" says Zhou Yang , an undergraduate at the China University of Political Science and Law .\nCars will become a necessary part of many people's lives in the coming years , and it's difficult to get a permit out of campus because of the pressures on working people's time . \"Having a full-time job after graduation offers limited time to learn to drive . We senior students have plenty of spare time , plenty of opportunities to learn.\" \nXu Jian , an official at the driving school, said undergraduates were very able and serious , and could grasp in an hour what it took ordinary people four hours to learn . In this driving school, middle-aged people , young women and college students are the main customers .\nTo get a driver's permit , a beginner is now required to have at least 86 hours' practice before the final road test .", "id": "high23602.txt"}
