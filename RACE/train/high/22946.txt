This made the birds very glad, for now there would be millions of seeds  to steal! While some of the birds were careful, the cranes   were daring ; they stole seeds from right under the farmers' noses. The cranes considered stealing is fun, and that morning they asked a simple-minded stork   to come along for the fun.\n         The stork went along, not knowing what the cranes were up to. But the party ended unexpectedly when the birds all got caught in the trap  of the farmer's net, who had set the trap for just that purpose.\n         When the farmer discovered the birds in his trap, the stork asked for mercy  .\n         \"Please, Farmer, sir, I am a stork. I come from a good family that is honest and true. I went along with the cranes, but I had no idea they were going to steal from you,\" the bird said.\n         \"You may come from a good family, but I caught you with the birds who were stealing. So you will receive the same punishment!\" replied the farmer.\n         You are judged by the company that you keep.", "id": "high22946.txt"}
