But immigrations hoping to become Australian citizens will soon have to take a test examining their knowledge of the country's history and institutions.\nWhile Australia prides itself on its multicultural background, the government wants newcomers to integrate  more  fully . Form later this year, new immigrants will have to show an understanding of the English language. They will also be required to answer 20 questions from a list of 200. Anyone who gives fewer than 12 correct responses will not be accepted.\nImmigrants will also have to accept what the government considers to be 10 important Australia values, including \"mateship\" and \"giving people a fair go\". Other important Australia values are said to include tolerance, compassion, gender equality and freedom of speech.\nThe new citizenship application procedures are detailed in a 40-pages booklet . It describes Australia as \"a nation at ease with the world and  itself\" but says that newcomers are expected to respect its values. The booklet sums up mateship as voluntary helping and receiving help from others, especially in difficult times. The immigration Minister said they aimed to achieve a balance between ethnic diversity and social stability , \"particularly as we now draw people from so many different countries and so many different cultures\".\nCritics have attacked the English language requirement, pointing out many immigrants could not speak English when they arrived. But the minister said, \"We are trying to encourage people to learn English, because we think that is the way they will achieve their dreams in Australia.\"", "id": "high1948.txt"}
