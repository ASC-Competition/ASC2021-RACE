Despite her 70 years of age, Mrs Ilachinsiki, an architect working on the 91\nfloor of 2 World Trade Center, the south tower, went for the stairs. Twelve floors above her, Judy Wein, an executive  , cried sharply and set off too.\nBut others up and down the 110 floors, many without seeing the damage across the way and thus unclear about what was happening, were not so sure. And the 18 minutes before the next plane would hit were ticking off.\nMost people had no idea about what was the best thing to do, formal announcements inside the south tower asked people to\n, assuring them that the building was sound and the threat was limited to the other tower.\nSome left, others stayed. Some began to climb down and, when met with more announcements and other cautions   to stop or return, went back up. The decisions made in those instants proved to be of great importance, because many who chose to stay were killed completely when the second plane crashed into the south tower.\nOne of those caught in indecision   was the executive at Fuji Bank USA.\nRichard Jacobs of Fuji Bank left the 79\nfloor with the other office workers, but on the 48\nfloor they heard the announcement that the situation was under control. Several got in the lifts and went back up, two minutes or so before the plane crashed into their floor.\n\"I just don't know what happened to them,\" Mr Jacobs said.", "id": "high15994.txt"}
