You are not alone. Holidays are times for feasting and celebrating. Many people are worried about their weight.With proper planning,though,it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays.Whether it is celebrating at the office party or sitting down for the traditional family dinner,regard eating as a time for tasting a variety of the foods.The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.\nHere are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness:\nDon't skip meals.Before you leave home,have a small,low-fat meal or snack.This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.\nControl portions.Use a small plate (about 10 inches) and put aside the large ones that may encourage you to \"load up.\" You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist. Once you have your \"tasting\" serving,move away from the buffet . Doing so will make it less tempting to be eating constantly as your appetite is inspired by the sight of food.\nBegin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables. Or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you feel full.\nStick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk after a meal can help burn off excess calories.\nAvoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have a large amount of fat. Choose lean meats. Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of dessert or butter.", "id": "high8872.txt"}
