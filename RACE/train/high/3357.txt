Hugh Grant bumps   into Julia Roberts and spills   orange juice all over her. After the _ , Grant repeatedly says: \" I am so sorry. I am so sorry.\"\nHis actions in this scene are very British. If Roberts' character were from Britain then she would probably apologize repeatedly as well--even if the crash were not her fault. But this doesn't happen in the film, as Roberts is from the US.\nA report in The Telegraph last week said that three-quarters of British people apologize when they bump into someone in the street -- regardless of whether they are responsible or not. In fact, we Britons use \"sorry\" in many situations. For example, if we mishear someone, we say \"Sorry?\" The person we are talking to will also apologize by replying: \"No, I am sorry!\" This can go on for up to five minutes as we compete over who is the most sorry.\nLife is never as simple as \"duibuqi\" and \"meiguanxi\".\nHow we use \"sorry\" has changed.

Another theory is that we apologize to avoid confrontation . For example, if you bump into someone they might get angry. To avoid this we instantly say \"Sorry!\".\nTrue manners are about being considerate and the modern day obsession with apologizing show that we are perhaps not as thoughtful as we once were. The word has lost some of its meaning. Do you see my point? Sorry, it might just be a British thing...", "id": "high3357.txt"}
