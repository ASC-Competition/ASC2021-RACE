Friends and mates allow us to enjoy our success and our joys, comfort us in our challenging moments, and provide a mirror for us to learn more about ourselves. I've always looked at friends as the family we choose. They enrich our lives. As Robert Louis Steven once said, \"A friend is a present which you give yourself.\"\n   To be a good friend or partner, it's importable be a good listener. Hear what your friend or mate has to say first rather than jumping to conclusions or getting defensive. Sometimes it is useful to be their mirror, for when they hear their words repeated back to them, it can help them to realize that what they said was not exactly what they meant to say.\n   Patience, compassion and empathy are also important traits in being a good friend or partner. You know the old golden rule, \"Care for others the way you would like them to care for you.\" The support of a friend during a tough time could make the difference between success and failure. Encouragement and confidence are priceless gifts that can help change a person's life.\n   Take care, though, with whom you choose to have close relationship, for they can have a tremendous impact on your self-esteem and life path. As someone once told me,\"the attitude of your friends are like the buttons on an elevator. They will either take you up or down.\"", "id": "high23714.txt"}
