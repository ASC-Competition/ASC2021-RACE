What are you good at? Instead of saying \"I' m a loser\",try saying,\"I am capable./I'm good at.../I accept myself the way I am.\"\n   Thinking poorly about ourselves gets us nowhere and is extremely self-limiting.Decide today to turn off the negative self-talk channel in your mind and develop your true potential.", "id": "high17908.txt"}
