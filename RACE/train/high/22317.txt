It was back in 1981, and I saw many people gathered in someone's front yard. As I went nearer to see what was happening I got my first introduction to yard sales. For the few dollars I had in my wallet, I was able to buy a seven-inch black-and-white portable TV. I also bought a flashlight.\nThe following weekend, at another yard sale, I saw a 14-inch color1 TV being sold for almost nothing. I felt I could not miss the offer and bought it.

So I told my father that I would send as many types of items as I could so that he could start his resale business.\nEvery few months I would gather several boxes of American \"junk\" --- televisions, toasters, fans, hair dryers, etc. and send them home. As word got out about my father's \"trash\" market, people all came to buy these things.\nThree years later, when I visited my family for the first time since leaving home, I learned that many of the families in our neighborhood had a piece of \"trash\".
