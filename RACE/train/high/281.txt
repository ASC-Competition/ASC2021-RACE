My every waking hour was consumed  by the project and although I imagined that I would feel happy after completing parts of the project, I was confused to find that instead, I was feeling rather depressed. I tried a range of methods to help cheer myself up. I had a relaxing bath, cooked a delicious meal to enjoy with my family and even watched a lighthearted  movie, but _ . It was only when I turned to meditation for a solution that the answer came to me: turn to nature!\nThe very next day, I grabbed my camera and a bottle of water and set off to spend a few hours walking in a nature reserve, even though it was pouring with rain. Within a couple of minutes I felt alive again. To be honest, I felt like a young school girl again and had to stop myself from hopping  along the path singing, \"I'm singing in the rain\", a song I used to sing when I was a child. I think as adults we often try too hard to control our inner children and as a result we restrain  our own spirits, which only leads to depression and stress.\nInterestingly, it has been shown that people who spend 40 minutes walking in a nature reserve have a drop in their blood pressure levels, but this does not happen when they spend a similar amount of time walking in a busy city centre.\nIf you feel a little low in spirit and know that you have spent too much time indoors, relax completely, remove your shoes and let your inner child come out and play.", "id": "high281.txt"}
