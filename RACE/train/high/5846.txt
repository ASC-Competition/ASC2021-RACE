However, the previous method of getting and using cells from either fetal  or adult human tissue remains challenging due to ethical concerns and immune system rejections, he said.\nPei hopes the discovery will be used to generate NPCs from patients with nerve disorders such as Parkinson's disease. \"These NPCs from patients may help us discover new drugs for these diseases.\"\n\"It is a remarkable advance in the stem cell field. The results and methods obtained from this study will be of great value and significance to the field, \" said Fred Gage,a professor with the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.", "id": "high5846.txt"}
