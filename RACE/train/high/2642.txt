The music was so great that many people stopped to put some money into the hat of the young man.\nThe next day, the young artist came to the same place, and put his hat on the ground gracefully. Different from the day before, he took out a large piece of paper and laid it under his hat. Then he began to play the violin. It sounded more pleasant than ever.\nSoon he was surrounded with people who were attracted by the words on that paper. It said, \"Last night, a gentleman named George Sang put an important thing into my hat by mistake. Please come to claim  it soon.\"\nAfter about half an hour, a middle-aged man rushed through the crowd to the violinist and said, \"Yes, it's you. I knew that you were an honest man and would certainly come here.\" The young violinist asked calmly, \"Are you Mr. George Sang?\" The man nodded. The violinist asked, \"Did you lose something?\" \"It's a lottery ticket,\" said the man. The violinist took out a lottery ticket on which George Sang's name was seen. \"Is it?\" he asked. George nodded and took the lottery ticket and kissed it, then danced with the violinist.\nThe violinist was a student at an arts college and had planned to attend advanced studies in Vienna. Later his classmate asked the violinist, \"At that time you needed money to pay the tuition  and you had to play the violin in the railway station every day to make money. Why didn't you keep the lottery ticket for yourself?\" The violinist said, \"Although I don't have much money, I live happily. But if I lose honesty I won't be happy forever.\"\nThrough our lives, we can gain a lot and lose so much. But being honest should always be with us.", "id": "high2642.txt"}
