There are different ways of looking at this question.\nFirst, why do teenagers need to have the latest models? Often it's just to show off. The paradox is that there are many teenagers who own the latest cell-phone models but don't even know how to use them properly. This is true. They just want one because their friends have similar ones, or because they take very good videos and photos.\nOn the other hand, if they do know how to use them, the latest cell phones are really good. They not only help teens to stay in touch with friends and family, but also help them to access the Internet and download pictures, videos or music they need when studying. These new phones are so powerful that having one is almost like having a whole library in your pocket. It's an instant   source of information that helps young people get the latest news. But many parents, thinking only of such positive sides, do not take into consideration the potential dangers. For example, children may constantly be distracted  during class by sending and receiving text messages.\nEach young generation loves the new technologies available --just think back to when you were a kid. But your job as a parent is to make sure your child gets the most out of this technology with the least possible harm.", "id": "high8506.txt"}
