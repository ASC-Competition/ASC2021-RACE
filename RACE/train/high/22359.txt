He told me to watch the circles created by the stone. Then he asked me to think of myself as that stone. \"You may create lots of circles in your life, but the waves that come from those circles will disturb the peace of all your fellow people,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Remember that your circle may touch many other circles, meaning that your thoughts or actions may disturb others' lives. You are responsible for what you put in your circle. You will need to live in a way that allows the good or peace that comes from your circle to be sent to others. At the same time, the anger or jealousy  coming from your circle may also spread to other circles. You are responsible for both.\"\n    For the first time in my life, I realized that each person's inner peace or discord  can flow out into the world. If we are filled with inner conflict , doubt or anger, we cannot create world peace. We spread the feelings and thoughts that we hold inside, whether we speak them or not. Whatever circles are inside us, they are spreading into the world, creating beauty or discord with all other circles of life.", "id": "high22359.txt"}
