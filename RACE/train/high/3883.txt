In 1956, he heard for the first time Lewis Carroll's extraordinary tale of Alice in Wonderland--the story of a Victorian girl who falls down a rabbit hole, meets a lot of funny characters and experience all kinds of things. At that time, Blackman's wife was suffering from progressive blindness. The story of Alice moving through the strange situations, often disheartened by various events, was similar to his wife's experiences. It also reflected so much of his own life. All this contributed to the completion of the Alice in Wonderland paintings.\nIllustrator Workshop\nGo straight to the experts for an introductory course in book illustration .
