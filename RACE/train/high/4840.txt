So Forestwood High School, Texas, used the \"flipped   classroom\" method of instruction. \"We've completely done away with our lecture,\" Derow said. And homework assignments \"are all done in class,\" Bradley said.\nWith the flipped concept, a student's usual homework assignment is to watch pre-recorded lectures on their computers or smart phones.They walk into class ready to discuss the topic, collaborate  with other students and work on assignments based on what they learned from the video. Free from lecturing, the teachers can use class time to look deeper into the subject and focus on difficult concept. As students change from a passive to an active role, they learn critical thinking skills, learn to collaborate and become independent learners.\nInstead of doing homework assignments alone at home, students are now \"working together, talking about it,\" Bradley said. \"If they don't agree on an answer, they debate it and have to justify their answers. It's a higher level of learning.\"\nHer students give the flipped classroom high marks.\nSarah Lee, 14, watches the 30-minute videos on a home computer.
