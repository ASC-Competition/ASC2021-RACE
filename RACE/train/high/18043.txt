Secondary students in these countries are taught structured essay formats   to improve their writing skills, and essays are often used by universities in these countries in selecting applicants. Essays are also used to judge the mastery and comprehension of material. Students are asked to explain, comment on, or assess a topic of study in the form of an essay. During some courses, university students will often be required to complete one or more essays that are prepared over several weeks or months. In addition, in fields such as the humanities and social sciences, mid-term and end-of-term examinations often require students to write a short essay in two or three hours.\nIn these countries, so-called academic essays, which may also be called \"papers\", are usually more formal than literary ones. They may still allow the presentation of the writer's own views, but this is done in a logical and factual manner, with the use of the first person often discouraged. Longer academic essays (often with a word limit of between 2,000 and 5,000 words) sometimes begin with a short summary analysis   of what has previously been written on a topic, which is often called a literature review.\nOne of the challenges facing US universities is that in some cases, students may hand in essays which have been purchased from an essay mill (or \"paper mill\") as their own work. An \"essay mill\" is a ghostwriting service that sells pre-written essays to university and college students. Since plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty or academic fraud, universities and colleges may look into papers suspected to be from an essay mill by using Internet plagiarism detection software, which compares essays against a database of known mill essays and by orally testing students on the contents of their papers.", "id": "high18043.txt"}
