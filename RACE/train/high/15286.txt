Everyone tries to please you, and you can do whatever you want to,\" said his sister. \"It's quite the opposite sometimes, in fact. Because I'm famous, I can't do what I want to,\" he denied. \"But look, we're sitting at the best table and eating the best food. We couldn't sit here and eat this if you weren't famous,\" said his sister. \"I'll show you what I mean,\" said he.\nThe next day, the famous man picked up his sister and took her to another country. \"I'm not at all famous here,\" he said. \"Let's see how we get on.\" Soon they found a restaurant, but it was very busy, so they had to queue. \"This wouldn't have happened if you were famous,\" said his sister, but the famous man just smiled.\nWhen they finally got a table, it took the waiter years to bring what they ordered. And the food supposed to be hot was cold, and the food supposed to be cold was hot! Eventually, the famous man couldn't stand any more and asked to see the manager. \"This food is awful. We had to wait an hour for a seat, and the service is also very poor. Look, even my spoon is dirty!\"\nShowing his horribly yellow teeth, the manager, smiling, said, \"Well, that's just bad luck for you.\"\n\"Don't you know who I am?\" asked the famous man.\n\"I've no idea,\" replied the manager.\nSo the famous man and his sister ran away, without paying.", "id": "high15286.txt"}
