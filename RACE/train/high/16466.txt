After all the couple had been dating since they met in a cafe three months earlier.\nBut little can he have imagined that 70 years on, not only would he still be happy about having married Doris, but that every year she would present him with the very same card he gave her that Valentine's Day. \"I bring it out of the cupboard and put it on our mantelpiece every Valentine's Day,\" she said. \"It's a special to me now as it was 70 years ago. Harry has never bought me one since, because I have this one every year.\"\nThey first met in a cafe. \"Harry was in the cafe drinking and he said hello. He asked me my name and we got talking happily. He offered to walk me to the bus stop but when we got outside, a bombing raid had started and we had to run to a nearby air-raid shelter ,\" Doris said.\nMr. Ward said,\"I knew Doris was the one for me the moment I met her. I gave her the Valentine's card then and she is still my Valentine now.\" Mrs. Ward's card is not the only thing that has endured the passing of time.\n\"Harry is quite romantic and we are as still in love as the day he first gave me this card,\"Dorris said.", "id": "high16466.txt"}
