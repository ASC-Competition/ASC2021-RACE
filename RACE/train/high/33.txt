Unlike some countries,\nAmericans generally pay the price of a product without question, instead of trying to get a lower price by bargaining. However, there are many \"sales\" in the United States, during which time stores will lower their normal prices. This may all be very confusing to visitors. How are you going to know how to \"get your money's worth\" when you shop? Perhaps the best advice is: Don't hurry. Visit various stores and determine the quality of goods. Read the advertisements so that you can compare prices.\nThere is a great variety of shops in the United States, ranging from very large stores called \"department stores\" to very small shops. There are \"discount houses\" offering goods at low prices, and \"dime stores\" specializing in a wide range of inexpensive items.\nMost department stores in large cities carry better quality products at higher prices. However, they offer the shoppers great convenience since they contain such a wide variety of products.\nIf convenience isn't as important to you as price, you may want to shop in discount houses. These stores have nearly as great a variety of goods as department stores, but offer lower prices. They can do so for several reasons. They don't offer the same services to buyers that department stores do; there may be fewer sales people; and the store probably doesn't deliver purchases.\nAnother popular shop is the \"dime store\". No longer selling many things for five or ten cents, these stores got their name in the last century when it was decided that a small profit on a great quantity of goods would be better than a large profit on fewer sales. Dime stores specialize in a wide variety of inexpensive items and today, prices range from a quarter or 50 cents up to several dollars.", "id": "high33.txt"}
