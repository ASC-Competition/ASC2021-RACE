Are you tired of Mom or Dad dragging you to the same old petting zoos, where (if you're lucky) you might get to touch a little rabbit or goat?\nMom or Dad! Are you tired of hearing your kids complain about how animals in the same old petting zoos are monotonous?\nConsider This:\nThe fact is that most mammals are boringly warm, furry, and come in a limited range of dull color1s. Reptiles, on the other hand, are cold-blooded and covered with scale of attractive color1s, from bright green to bright red to dark purple-red. Some, like the chameleon, can even CHANGE color1s. Did you ever see a rabbit with scales and a purple tongue almost as long as its body? NO! In our zoos, you can see pet skink, snakes, bearded dragons, and other fascinating creatures! Learn what these reptiles eat and how they care for their babies, which ones live in the desert and which live in wetlands, which ones are meat-eaters and which are vegetarians, which ones are deadly poisonous and which are not.\nSo Remember:\nIf you're bored with furry animals like rabbits...\nThen the place for YOU is the Reptile Petting Zoo!\nBring the WHOLE family -- Grandpa, Grandma, Cousin Irene, even baby Joe! There's something for EVERYONE!", "id": "high18879.txt"}
