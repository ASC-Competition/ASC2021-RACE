These awful sudden risings of the sea are caused by earthquakes or underwater volcanic action. The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of such a disaster.\n    Yuuki lived with his family in a sea-side village, below a small mountain. One day, as he played on top of the mountain, he felt an earthquake beneath his feet. It was not strong enough to frighten anybody and passed quickly. Soon after, however, Yuuki noticed the sea darken and begin running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide stretches of beach that had never been exposed before.\n    With a gasp, Yuuki remembered reading that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. He ran to the beach, warning the villagers who had gathered to admire the huge new stretch of beach.\n    \"Get back!\" shouted the boy. \"There is terrible danger!\"\nBut no one listened. They laughed at him and continued playing in the new sand and watching the sea roll backward even more.\n    Desperate, Yuuki could think of only one thing to do. He lit a tree branch, raced to the rice fields and began burning the stacks of harvested rice. Then he called out, \"Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Now!\"\n    When everyone reached the mountain-top, a villager cried out, \"Yuuki is mad! I saw him set the fire.\" Yuuki hung his head in shame, but said nothing as the villagers cursed him.\n    Just then, someone cried, \"Look!\"\n    In the distance what seemed to be a huge dark line was speeding towards the shore. As it got nearer the people realized the long thin line of darkness was the returning sea, towering like a mountain.\n    The villagers watched in terror as the water struck the shore, smashing over their homes then tearing out the land as it receded.\n    On the mountain everyone stared speechlessly at the destruction below.\n    \"I'm sorry I burned the fields,\" said Yuuki, his voice trembling.\n    \"Yuuki,\" village-chief answered. \"You saved us all.\"\nThe villagers cheered and raised Yuuki into the air. \"We were going to celebrate our rice harvest tonight,\" said one, \"but now we'll celebrate that we're all still alive!\"\n,(A, B, CD),.", "id": "high21831.txt"}
