People need new words for new ideas and new inventions. Some new words come into use, and some old words are used in a new way.\nEnglish can change by borrowing words from other languages. The word \"tomato\" was borrowed from Mexico, and \"tea\" came from China, and so on. Now a great many new space and science words are being borrowed from other countries, too. New words can be created in other ways. For example, some can be created by adding two words together. \"Weekend\" and \"cookbook\" are made up of two parts. Sometimes new words are shorter forms of older words. The word \"photo\" was made from \"photograph\" by cutting off the end of the longer word. \"Plane\" was made by cutting off the front part of \"airplane\". The names of people and products can become new words. Our \"sandwich\"   was named after a man named Sandwich and \"sello \" was a name given by the company that first made the product.", "id": "high8553.txt"}
