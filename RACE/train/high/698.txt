Teaching was a profession I had never seriously considered, though several of my stories had been published. I accepted the job without hesitation, as it would allow me to wear a tie and go by the name of Mr. Davis. My father went by the same name, and I liked to imagine people getting the two of us confused. \"Wait a minute,\" someone might say, \"are you talking about Mr. Davis the retired man, or Mr. Davis the respectable scholar?\"\nThe position was offered at the last minute, and I was given two weeks to prepare, a period I spent searching for briefcase   and standing before my full-length mirror, repeating the words, \"Hello, class. I'm Mr. Davis.\" Sometimes I would give myself an aggressive voice. Sometimes I would sound experienced. But when the day eventually came, my nerves kicked in and the true Mr. Davis was there. I sounded not like a thoughtful professor, but rather a 12-year-old boy.\nI arrived in the classroom with paper cards designed in the shape of maple leaves. I had cut them myself out of orange construction paper. I saw nine students along a long table. I handed out the cards, and the students wrote down their names and fastened them to their breast pockets as I required.\n\"All right then,\" I said. \"Okay, here we go.\" Then I opened my briefcase and realized that I had never thought beyond this moment. I had been thinking that the students would be the first to talk, offering their thoughts and opinions on the events of the day. I had imagined that I would sit at the edge of the desk, overlooking a forests of hands. Every student would yell. \"Calm down, you'll all get your turn. One at a time, one at a time!\"\nA terrible silence ruled the room, and seeing no other opinions, I inspected the students to pull out their notebooks and write a brief essay related to the theme of deep disappointment.", "id": "high698.txt"}
