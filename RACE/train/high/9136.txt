Researchers at the University of Chicago who studied mother-child interactions   found that the type of praise children receive affects their attitudes towards challenges later in life.\nSpecifically, praise that focused on their behavior and the choices that kids made helped them deal with difficult experiences better five years later, compared with praise that focused more on the child himself, like \"You're a good boy.\" The study, which appears in the journal Child Development, is the first major study of praise and child development done outside of a lab setting.\n\"It's exciting to see _ play out in the real world,\" said Elizabeth Gunderson who led the study. \"Praising the efforts, actions and work of kids is going to be more beneficial in their long-term persistence and desire to be challenged and work hard in the future.\"\nSuch \"process praise\" includes comments such as \"You worked really hard\", which emphasize a child's actions. \"Person praise\" includes comments like \"You're so smart\", which focus on a child's personal qualities. These distinctions   aren't new in the field of psychology, but exactly how they affect children's development over the years hasn't always been clear.\nAs part of the study, the researchers visited the homes of more than 50 kids between the ages of 1 and 3, and filmed their daily interactions with their parents during 90-minute sessions. Five years later, the researchers followed up with the families, measuring the children's attitudes towards challenges and problem solving. The children who grew up with more process praise were more open to challenges. Though person praise didn't seem to have any negative effect on the children, the study suggests that process praise teaches children that their talents and abilities can be developed and improved, while person praise sends the message that their abilities are fixed and therefore not easily changed.", "id": "high9136.txt"}
