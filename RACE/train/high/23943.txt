But they had a great time working on their Robotics merit badges  at the 2011 Advance Camp in Antioch , Calif .\nAdvance Camp is held the last Saturday in September at the Contra Costa County Fairgrounds in Antioch, Calif.Nearly 1,500 Scouts attended in 2011 and worked on different merit badges .Scouts choose from more than 50 merit -badge classes taught by counselors  .They can earn merit badges from Fingerprinting to Nuclear Science to Swimming .Robotics is the most popular class .\nFirst , one of the counselors talked to Matthew and the other Scouts in his Robotic class about the many different uses for robots . \"I learned how advanced it really is ,\" Matthew says . \"Robots are used in medicine and industry .\" After the talk , the Scouts were divided into five-person teams . Each team was required to build a basic robot .\nThe next step was programming the tiny computer in the robot so it would make the right moves once it was in the ring .\n\"We programmed our robot so its arm was moving all the time ,\" Matthew says . \"That way , it would knock the other robot over.\" .\nThat's when they discovered the arm on their robot was too long . As a result , their robot knocked itself over before it could fight with any other robots .\n\"It was a learning experience ,\" Matthew says . \"You have to think ahead.\"", "id": "high23943.txt"}
