I told him not to, but the North Polar Bear climbed up to the thin top to get it downand he did. The pole broke in the middle and fell on the roof of my house, and the North Polar Bear fell through the hole it made into the dining room with my hood over his nose, and all the snow fell off the roof into the house and melted and put out all the fires and ran down into the cellars where I was collecting this year's presents, and the North Polar\nBear's leg got broken.\nHe is well again now, but I was so cross with _ that he says he won't try to help me againI expect his temper is hurt, and will be mended by next Christmas.\nI send you a picture of the accident and of my new house on the cliffs above the North Pole(with beautiful cellars in the cliffs).\nThat's all.
