So,a few years ago,I wrote my own textbook.Compared to most other public speaking books,mine is half the number of pages,and one-third the price.That is,$30 instead of $90.When I wrote a second edition last year,students only had to buy the 35 new pages, For only $7.00,they had almost a new book. Now my loose-leaf textbook enjoys great popularity among the students.Maybe in the future more writers and publishers will try it.\"", "id": "high2030.txt"}
