He liked horses. He had a dream to own a horse ranch   ever since he was a little child.\nOne day when he was at high school, he was asked to write a paper. It was about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up. He worked hard on it, and wrote a seven-page paper. In the paper he described his dream of owning a big horse ranch someday.\nThe next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F(fail) with a note that read, \"See me after class.\"\nHe went to see the teacher after class and asked, \"Why did I receive an F?\"\nThe teacher answered, \"This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You come from a poor family. You have no money. Owning a horse ranch needs a lot of money. You have to buy the land.  _ \" Then he added, \"Write this paper again. If you write it with a realistic plan, you may receive a better grade.\"\nAfter sitting with it for a week, he turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He said to the teacher, \"You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.\"\nMonty kept his dream and worked very hard. Today he owns a large horse ranch with a big house on it, and he keeps that school paper he wrote on the wall of his sitting room.\nLast summer the same school teacher came to visit him. When the teacher was leaving, he said, \"Look, Monty, when I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of children's dreams. It was lucky that you hadn't given up yours.\"\nDon't let anyone steal your dream. Follow your dream, no matter what.", "id": "high20681.txt"}
