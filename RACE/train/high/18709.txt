He drove 100 miles a day, including the day he collected.\nBefore he was a newspaper carrier, he was also a teacher and a construction worker.\nHe opened the first motor delivery route in the newspaper's history. Driving a Model T Ford, his route consisted of Pottsboro, Gordonville, Sadler and Southmayd.
