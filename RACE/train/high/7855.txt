Blame it on pure dreaming and lack of surrounding goals for achieving their dreams.\nSetting goals is very significant part of accomplishing and positive actions. It is like scaling  a 200 feet construction and marking in the early hours on what feet you would like to reach at this specific period.\nPeople who set goals literally generate a map of their goal settings in life, marking where they should start, where to pause, where to study a bit, and where and when to end. Once this map comes into being, it allows the map drawer to check where he is in the scheme  of things and whether or not he is making some planning that will take him closer to his goals.\nBy surrounding goals, people will know how they are doing and what they should be doing to get their goals or dreams in life. They will know if they can relax or if they have to double their efforts when they are falling short of what is expected of them.\nGoal surroundings means a person is prepared in dealing with challenges that may affect his plans. Being proactive means one is able to outline possible difficulties that may occur as well as the solutions to these difficulties. By doing this, a person is not easily scared or defeated when challenges occur because he has already prepared for them. He knows they can happen and he has prepared a solution or strategy when that time comes.\nSetting goals will enable people to track their progress in whatever hard work they set out to do. It will help people become more confident in themselves and more motivated to get their plans.", "id": "high7855.txt"}
