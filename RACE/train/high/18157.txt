People moved farther\nand farther form the cities where they worked because they could drive their cars on these new\n roads from their suburban homes to work in the city. Some of the big car makers also bought the\n electrified transportation systems and destroyed them. As people stopped using public\n transporation , cities spent less money fixing old buses and trains or buying new ones. Public\n transportation got worse and worse.\n      In the late 1960s, people found out that the increase in the use of cars led to many\n problems.
