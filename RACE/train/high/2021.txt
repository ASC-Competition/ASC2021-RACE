No longer able to manage a home of her own, she moved in with my mother, where she was visited often by other members of her large, loving family. Although she still had her good days, it was often hard to arouse her interest.\nBut one chilly December afternoon three years ago, my daughter Meagan, then eight, and I were visiting her, when she noticed that Meagan was carrying her favorite doll.\"I, too, had a special doll when I was a little girl,\" she told a wide-eyed Meagan. \"I got it one Christmas when I was about your age. I lived in an old farmhouse in Maine, with Mom, Dad and my four sisters, and the very first gift I opened that Christmas was the most beautiful doll you'd ever want to see.\"\n\"She had an exquisite(,), hand-painted face, and her long brown hair was pulled back with a big pink bow. Her eyes were blue, and they opened and closed. I remember she had a body of kidskin, and her arms and legs bent at the joints.\"\nGG's voice dropped low, taking on an almost respectful tone. \"My doll was dressed in a pretty pink gown, decorated with fine lace. ... _ -- my parents must have had to sacrifice so much to afford it But how happy I was that morning!\"\nGG's eyes filled and her voice shook with emotion as she recalled that Christmas of long ago. \"I played with my doll all morning long. And then it happened. My mother called us to the dining room for Christmas dinner and I laid my new doll down gently on the hall table. But as I went to join the family at the table, I heard a loud crash.\"\n\"I hardly had to turn around -- I knew it was my precious doll. And it was. Her lace skirt had hung down from the table just enough for my baby sister to reach up and pull on it. When I ran in, there lay my beautiful doll on the floor, her face smashed into a dozen pieces. She was gone forever.\"\nA few years later, GG's baby sister was also gone, she told Meagan, a victim of pneumonia . Now the tears in her eyes spilled over -- tears, I knew, not only for a lost doll and a lost sister, but for a lost time.\nSubdued  for the rest of the visit, Meagan was no sooner in the car going home than she exclaimed, \"Mom, I have a great idea! Let's get GG a new doll for Christmas. Then she won't cry when she thinks about it.\"\nMy heart filled with pride as I listened to my sympathetic little daughter. But where would we find a doll to match GG's fond memories?\nWhere there's a will, as they say, there's a way. When I told my best friends, Liz and Chris, about my problem, Liz put me in touch with a local doll-make. From a doll supply house I ordered a long brown hair and a kidskin body to copy the outfit GG had so lovingly described. Liz volunteered to put the doll together, and Chris helped me make the doll's outfit. Meagan wrote the story of the lost doll by giving examples.\nFinally our creation was finished. To our eyes it was perfect. But there was no way it could be exactly like the doll GG had loved so much and lost. Would she think it looked anything like it?\nOn Christmas Eve, Meagan and I carried our happily packed gift to GG, where she sat surrounded by children, parents, aunts, uncles and cousins. \"It's for you,\" Meagan said, \"but first you have to read the story that goes with it.\"\nGG no sooner got through the first page than her voice cracked and she was unable to go on, but Meagan took over where she left off. Then it was time to open her present.\nI'll never forget the look on GG's face as she lifted the doll and held it to her chest. Once again her tears fell, but this time they were tears of joy. Holding the doll in her frail arms, she repeated over and over again, \"She's exactly like my old doll, exactly like her.\"\nAnd perhaps she wasn't saying that just to be kind. Perhaps however impossible it seemed, we had managed to produce a close copy of the doll she remembered. But as I watched my eight-year-old daughter and her great-grandmother examining the doll together, I thought of a likelier explanation. What GG really recognized, perhaps, was the love that inspired the gift. And love, wherever it comes from, always looks the same.", "id": "high2021.txt"}
