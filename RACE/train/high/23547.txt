The village of small houses dates back to about 2600 BC. That's about the same time Stonehenge was built. \"Clearly, this is a place that was of great importance,\" said researcher Mike Parker Pearson. \nThe ancient houses are at a site known as Durrington Walls. It is about 3.2 kilometers from Stonehenge. Researchers believe Stonehenge was a memorial site or cemetery for the villagers. The village also had a wooden version of the stone circle. It may have been used by people attending festivals at Stonehenge. \nEight of the houses have been dug up. Researchers say there may be as many as 25 of them. The wooden houses were square and about 5 meters along each side. There are signs that there were beds along the walls. There are also signs of a storage unit. The houses also had fireplaces. \nTwo of the houses were separate from the others. They may have been the homes of community leaders. Researchers say those didn't have the household rubbish that was found in the other homes. \nStone tools, animal bones, arrowheads and other things were found throughout the village site. \nStonehenge is a popular tourist spot in England. It is a huge circle made out of stones, which were placed in a grass field in southern England. The stone arches were made with two stones at the bottom and one across the top. All of the stones weigh a lot more than a big car. Scientists have long wondered not only how people built Stonehenge, but also why.", "id": "high23547.txt"}
