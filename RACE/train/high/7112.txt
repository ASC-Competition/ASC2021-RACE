You don't need statistics to understand the Dane's happy lot. Walk around any Danish town and you'll experience some of the most harmonious civic spaces anywhere. Their intimate scales and perfect transport systems combine the rich history and bold modern lines of the built environment to delight the eye, and the locals' manners and sense of humor is refreshing.\nDenmark's capital Copenhagen is a remarkable city with well-preserved medieval streets, renowned art galleries, Michelin-starred restaurants and a healthy business center. Finding something to do is never a problem and if all else fails, just admiring the streets with a hotdog in hand is an enjoyable way to spend a few hours .\nBeyond the capital and the bigger cities, Denmark offers a mix of lively towns such as Ribe and Odense plus rural countryside, medieval churches , Renaissance castles and tidy 18th-century villages.\nThe coastline of Denmark with its sand dunes and greenery is a sight that always attracts visitors. So, no matter what time of year you're in Denmark, you shouldn't miss out on a trip to the nearest beach .\nIt's hard , in short , to find fault with the place.

When viewed in this way , this first-rate destination seems like good value, and you get the fairy tales thrown in for free: the Danish royal family is genuinely loved and respected by the vast majority of its citizens, not least handsome Prince Frederik , his beautiful Australian-born princess-bride, Mar, and their young family.", "id": "high7112.txt"}
