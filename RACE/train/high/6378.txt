It was just after my first chemotherapy  treatment.\nMy scar was still very tender. My arm was numb underneath. As usual, I was taken to an examination room to have my blood drawn, again --a terrifying process for me, since I'm so frightened of needles.\nI lay down on the examining table. Ramona entered the room. Her warm smile was familiar, and stood out in contrast to my fears.  She knew about my fear of needles, and she kindly hid the equipment under a magazine. As we opened the blouse, the fresh scar on my chest could be seen.\nShe said, \"How is your scar healing?\"\nI said, \"I think pretty well. I wash around it gently each day.\" The memory of the shower water hitting my numb chest flashed across my face.\nShe gently reached over and ran her hand across the scar, examining the smoothness of the healing skin and looking for any irregularities. I began to cry gently and quietly. She brought her warm eyes to mine and said, \"You haven't touched it yet, have you?\" And I said, \"No.\"\nSo this wonderful, warm woman laid the hand on my chest and she gently held it there. For a long time, I continued to cry quietly. In soft tones she said, \"This is part of your body. This is you. It's okay to touch it.\" But I couldn't. So she touched it for me. The scar. The healing wound. And beneath it, she touched my heart. Then Ramona said, \"I'll hold your hand while you touch it.\" So she placed her hand next to mine, and we both were quiet. That was the gift that Ramona gave me.", "id": "high6378.txt"}
