Here are some letters from our readers.\n#Yes,  many  cyclists  behave  dangerously.  Many  drivers  are  disrespectful  of  cyclists.  But pedestrians are probably the worse offenders.\nPeople of all ages happily walk along the pavement with eyes and hands glued to the mobile phone, quite unaware of what is going on around them. They may even do the same thing whileN crossing a road at a pedestrian crossing or elsewhere. The rest of us have to evade   them or just  stand still to wait for the unavoidable collision.\nThe real problem is that some pedestrians seem to be, at least for the moment, in worlds of their own that are, to them, much more important than the welfare of others.\n----Michael Horan\n#I loved the letter from Bob Brooks about cyclists (Viewpoints, May 29). I am afraid they seem to think they own the roads.\nI was walking across Altrincham Road one morning when a cyclist went round me and on being asked what he was doing he shouted at me.\nThe government built a cycle lane on the road but it is hardly used. \nThe police do nothing. What a laugh they are!\nThe cyclists should all have to be made to use the cycle lanes and wear helmets, fluorescent   jackets and lights at night and in the morning. They should pay some sort of tax and be fined for not wearing them.\n----Carol Harvey\n#Cyclists jump on and off pavements (which are meant for pedestrians), ride at speed along the pavements, and think they have a special right to go through traffic lights when they are on red.\nI was almost knocked down recently by a cyclist riding on the pavement when there was a cycle  lane right next to him.\nOther road users, including horse riders, manage to obey the rules so why not cyclists?\nIt's about time they had to be registered and insured, so when they do hit a pedestrian or a vehicle, or cause an accident, at least they can be treated and there might be an opportunity to claim.\n----JML\nWrite to Viewpoints of the newspaper.", "id": "high19138.txt"}
