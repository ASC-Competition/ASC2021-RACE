We--as parents--are so eager to protect our kids that we fail to realize that this in itself is harming them. As the mother of two young sons, I have to remind myself all the time that the biggest responsibility I have as a parent is to help them develop the skills needed to live in, to live without me. So, I'll let them fail.\nI'll let them fail because as long as they are safe and warm inside their comfort zones, they will never grow. And failure--along with loss, heartbreak, disappointment, etc.--will be part of growth for them. Call me the anti-tiger mom, but leaving them alone is my way of helping them become equipped to fit in this world as we know it today. From terrorism   and seemingly endless natural disasters, to our national debt and beyond, if we expect the next generation to stand up to the very real problems of our time, we need to stop feeding them and start teaching them how to fish.\nMy children are faced with hard situations in their own life almost each day, but they try to negotiate   everything now. It's a small price to help them learn a skill they'll use for the rest of their lives, including when I don't come with them on job interviews.", "id": "high3792.txt"}
