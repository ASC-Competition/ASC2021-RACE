Researchers have unearthed  tiny bones that they believe belong to an entire new human species. If that's true, it will change how we think about our ancestors.\nClues that the little people may have lived long ago were first revealed last year in the scientific journal Nature. Scientists said that they had found the bones of a three-foot-tall female on the island of Flores, in Indonesia. When they looked more closely, they saw that the nearly complete skeleton  belonged to a full-grown adult. Researchers named her Hobbit, after the tiny heroes of the Lord of the Rings books.\nNow the team is saying it has unearthed even more pieces of the puzzle, including a jawbone and parts of arms, legs and hands from several individuals, as well as stone tools. They reported their find in Nature this month. \"The new evidence makes it very clear that these people are a new species, distinct from modern humans,\" Peter Brown, a scientist on the team, said. They named these ancient humans Homo floresiensis.\nBrown says that these little people lived as recently as 12,000 years ago. If Homo floresiensis was a different species from modern humans, that would make our family tree bigger than we knew. It means, says Brown, that \"until recently, a   shared the planet with us.\"\nMany scientists think a new species is unlikely. Some argue that the bones must have belonged to modern humans whose small size was the result of a genetic problem.\nDaniel E. Lieberman, a scientist at Harvard University, thinks that the debate over the discovery is healthy. He believes that the questions and arguments raised by critics will help us learn more about these unusual skeletons. \"Disagreement is an important part of the scientific process,\" Lieberman said. \"As far as I'm concerned, the story's only just begun.\"", "id": "high21259.txt"}
