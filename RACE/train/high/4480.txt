Over the past three years, the hotline received 8,488 calls. Statistics show 62 percent of the calls were made to ask about the funding policy, while 38 percent (3,200 calls) complained local colleges had failed to _ the rules to support the students.\nComplaints were seen a year-on-year decrease from 2006 to 2008.

To ensure education equality, the government has introduced a set of favorable policies to help poor students, such as scholarships, grants, student loans, tuition waivers  and the work-study programs under which poor students are helped out in libraries, teachers' offices or service departments to earn money.\nStatistics show the government spent 29.3 billion yuan last year to aid college students, up 7.6 percent from the previous year. Around 40 million persons of college students received the national aid.\nThe Ministry of Education of the government would ensure that no students drop out of colleges or universities because of poverty.\nAmong the 20 million students in the country's public and private universities and colleges last year, about 20 percent came from poor backgrounds, official figures show.", "id": "high4480.txt"}
