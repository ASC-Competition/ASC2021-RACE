But not all of those fired workers are sitting at home, reading the job advertisements and waiting for the phone to ring. Thousands of people are returning to school, making public colleges and universities among the few bright places in the disappointing US economy.\nAt a time when many Americans have had their work hours cut or have even lost their jobs, Sherian Huddleston is working overtime. She works at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) where she oversees   the enrollment   of new students. The university's population grew by 800 students this term --an increase of 4 percent over last spring's enrollment. Huddleston says seeing the enrollment rise in a failing economy is not unexpected. \"When people are out of work,\" she points out, \"they will ask 'What else can I do?' or 'What other careers can I follow?' They will often return to school if they have not completed a degree before.\"\nOlder returning students aren't the only ones increasing the enrollment at MTSU. Huddleston says she's also seeing an increase in student transfers  . \"Students who went out of state, or even within the state, to more expensive schools are transferring to public schools to make use of the lower cost of going to school here,\" she explains.", "id": "high2684.txt"}
