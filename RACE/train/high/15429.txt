There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon   of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st.\nCalifornia already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices.\nThe court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell.\nThe drought   around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce   the effect of the price rise here.\nThe 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies  , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing.", "id": "high15429.txt"}
