Far enough to find out your possibility of dying from a terrible disease? These days that's more than an academic question, as Tracy Smith reports in our Cover Story.\nThere are now more than a thousand genetic tests, for everything from baldness to breast cancer, and the list is growing. Question is, do you really want to know what might eventually kill you? For instance, Nobel Prize-winning scientist James Watson, one of the first people to map their entire genetic makeup, is said to have asked not to be told if he were at a higher risk for Alzheimer' .\n\"If I tell you that you have an increased risk of getting a terrible disease, that could weigh on your mind and make you anxious, through which you see the rest of your life as you wait for that disease to hit you. It could really mess you up.\" Said Dr. Robert Green, a Harvard geneticist.\n\"Every ache and pain,\" Smith suggested, \"could be understood as the beginning of the end.\" \"That 's right. If you ever worried you were at risk for Alzheimer's disease, then every time you can't find your car in the parking lot, you think the disease has started.\"\nDr. Green has been thinking about this issue for years.

But Green and his team found that there was \"no significant difference\" between how people handled good news and possibly the worst news of their lives. In fact, most people think they can handle it. People who ask for the information usually can handle the information, good or bad, said Green.", "id": "high4009.txt"}
