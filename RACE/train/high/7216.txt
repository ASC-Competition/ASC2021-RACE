When parents learn that their child has hearing loss, they are faced with many difficult decisions. These decisions can include choosing therapies and schools, as well as finding financial help for hearing aids or cochlear implants  .\nHelp Me Hear Foundation is a public charity that gives the gift of hearing to deaf children from families existing on very low incomes around the world.\nHelp Me Hear Foundation believes that a child's first years of development are critical. Being able to hear is vital to human, and Help Me Hear Foundation seeks to provide a positive lasting impression on society through its programs.\nRecipients of Help Me Hear Foundation's benefits receive state-of-the-art hearing devices that otherwise would cost thousands of dollars per child over the course of their lifetime. The Foundation raises money through donations for hearing aids and cochlear implants, which saves recipients and their families on average over $50,000 on related expenses.\nThe Foundation tries to be a transparent charity, and wants to be a catalyst for allowing deaf and hearing-impaired children to develop in a typical fashion alongside their peers.\nNeedy families can obtain information on specific services, and find out about deafness education by visiting the Help Me Hear Foundation's website. The website offers helpful information on how hearing aids work, and how hearing aids ease many of the learning and language challenges that hearing-impaired children deal with on a daily basis.", "id": "high7216.txt"}
