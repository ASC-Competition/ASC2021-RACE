They also carry advertisements on the outside.  Restaurants, companies, banks, and other businesses pay for the ads, hoping to attract more customers. Anci it's a way for the schools to make money.\n\"We've seen a lot of income produced by the advertisements,\" said Devra Ash, who is the spokesperson for School District 11 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. She is also the mother of a third grader.  Last year, District 11 made more than $ 15,000 from school-bus ads.Besides Colorado, states such as Arizona, New Jersey, and Texas allow ads on the outside of their school buses. The idea appears to be spreading. In Georgia, some school district leaders are suggesting putting ads on their buses ioo.\nSchool districts need to make sure that the ads are proper for kids, according to Michael Beauchamp, an officer of Alpha Media. This company works with businesses in several states to create ads for school buses. \"The districts won't allow ads for things like beer, cigarettes,or politics,\" Beauchamp said.\nBut not everyone is in favor of school buse.s having ads on the outside. That includes Georgia's Department of Education. Spokeswoman Dorie Nolt said, \"We strongly believe that advertising on the outside of school buses distracts  drivers and children. \"\nParents also hold different opinions about this. \"If the advertisements can bring in money  for the schools and help save some programs, that is great. \" said Glenn Herdling of River Vale, New Jersey.  His son is in second grade.\nCindy Tomarchio of East Windsor, New Jersey, feels differently. \"I know the schools can use the money, but kids already see enough advertising every which way they turn,\" she said.", "id": "high19197.txt"}
