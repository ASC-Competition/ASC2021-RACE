Chick says last week's reunion brought tears of joy to his eyes---despite the fact that Nigel bit him when he first tried to pick him up.\nMicco said the behaviour was not unusual and that Nigel would settle back in soon enough. \"He is doing very well,\" Chick told the newspaper. \"It is really strange. I knew it was him from the minute I saw him\"\nIt is the fifth parrot reunion helped by Micco, who has been running advertisements for her own missing bird for nine months. That parrot, Benjamin, escaped in February when it flew out through a door that had been left open.\nJulissa Sperling found Nigel outside her home and brought him to Micco after seeing one of her advertisements. \"He was the happiest bird. He was singing and talking all the time,\" Sperling said. \"He was barking like my dogs. I am from Panama, and he was saying, 'What happened?' in Spanish.\"", "id": "high18923.txt"}
