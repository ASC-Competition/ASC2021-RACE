Health experts say you can still enjoy the holidays.\n\"It's OK to indulge , but it doesn't mean you have to gain weight,\" said Karen Ansel, a New York-based registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association (ADA). Jessica Crandall, a registered dietitian from Denver who's also an ADA spokeswoman, added that gaining weight during the holidays and then working hard to lose it again is not good for a person's body.\nFor starters, people interested in maintaining their weight during the holidays should keep eating on a regular schedule, the two dietitians said. Research has shown that people who skip meals -- particularly breakfast -- end up eating more throughout the day. \"Try and stick to consistent meal times so you can avoid being overly hungry,\" Crandall said. \"When you're overly hungry, you can make some bad decisions regarding what you eat. Don't starve yourself during the day waiting for that party at night -- because you'll eat too much or overeat.\"\nAnsel suggests that you think now about the foods you really enjoy and plan to focus on those while eating less of more common fare.\nBe careful, too, about alcohol intake, for a couple of reasons. Alcoholic drinks, particularly the fancy ones handed out at holiday time, tend to come loaded with calories. \"It's usually what you're adding to a drink that contains the calories,\" Crandall said. Also, if you're drunk, you might forget to watch what you're eating. \"It totally lowers your inhibitions ,\" Ansel said.\nOther holiday eating tips, suggested by Crandall and Ansel, include:\n*Eat lots of vegetables, and eat them first before moving on to the other items on your plate.\n*Recognize that many holiday extras, like cheese or cranberry sauce, come loaded with calories. \"If those aren't your favorite foods, don't put them on your plate,\" Crandall said.\n*If your favorite food has a lot of calories, be sure to minimize your portion. \"Two bites cure the craving,\" Crandall said. \"After that, you're just really feeding your old habits.\n*After a big holiday meal, don't sink into a chair or couch. Go for a walk outdoors or participate in some other activities that help burn off some of the calories you've just eaten.", "id": "high2527.txt"}
