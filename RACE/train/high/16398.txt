Students must also have been resident in the UK for at least three years, which can exclude   some students from overseas.\nSPECIAL CASES\nIf a student has worked before going to college:\nA student who is 26 or more before the course starts and who has worked for at least three of the previous six years will get extra money--PS155 a year if 26, increasing to a maximum of PS615 at 29 or more.\nIf a student is handicapped  :\nLEAs will give up to PS500 to help meet extra expenses--such as buying a tape recorder for a blind student, extra heating or special food.\nBanking:\nMost of the big banks offer special services to students who open accounts (in the hope that they will stay with the bank when they become rich officials). A student won't usually have to pay bank charges as long as the account stays in credit. Some banks allow students to overdraw by PS100 or so, and still don't make charges (though they do charge interest).", "id": "high16398.txt"}
