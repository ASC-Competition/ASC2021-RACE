You may treat life with the philosophy   of the vegetable, in which case your life will include being born, eating, drinking, sleeping, marrying, growing old and dying.\nThe second basic attitude is to look at life as if it were a business. A great many so-called successful men and women believe that life is a business. If you believe so, your first question of life, naturally, is \" What do I get out of it? \" \" How much is this worth to me?\" In a word, based on this attitude, happiness becomes a matter of successful competition. The great majority of human beings today look at life as if it were a business.\nThe third attitude toward life is the way of the artist. Here the basic philosophy is \"What can I put into it?\".
