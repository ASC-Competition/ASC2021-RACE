I knew very well that in addition to the great planets-- such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus-- to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, \"Asteroid 325.\" \nI have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612. This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909. On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration . But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.\nGrown-ups are like that... \nFortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator  made a law that his subjects  should change to European costume under pain of death  .So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report. \nIf I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is for the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, \"What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?\" Instead, they demand: \"How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much money does his father make?\" \nIf you were to say to the grown-ups: \"I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,\" they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: \"I saw a house that cost $20,000.\" Then they would cry out: \"Oh, what a pretty house that is!\" \n  _ , if you say to them: \"The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep.\" And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: \"The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,\" then they would be convinced, and leave you free from their questions. \nThey are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people. But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference .", "id": "high17582.txt"}
