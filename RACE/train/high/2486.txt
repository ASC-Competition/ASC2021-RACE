Some experts say that scientific progress will one day help humans to last tens of years longer than what is now seen as the natural limit of the human life span .\n\" I think _ ,\" said Michael Zey, a Montclair State University business professor and author of two books on the future. \" I think by 2075 we will see it and that's a conservative estimate .\"\nAt the conference in San Francisco, Donald Louria, a professor at New Jersey Medical School in Newark said progress in using genes as well as nanotechnology makes it likely that humans will live in the future beyond what has been possible in the past. \" There is a great push so that people can live from 120 to 180 years,\" he said. \" Some have suggested that there is no limit and that people could live to 200 or 300 or 500 years.\"\nHowever, many scientists who research into aging are doubtful about _ and say the human body is just not designed to last about 120 years. Even with healthier lifestyles and less disease, they say failure of the brain and organs will finally lead all humans to death.\nScientists also disagree on what kind of life the super aged might live. \"It remains to be seen whether you could be healthy enough to have good quality of life when you pass 120.\" said Leonard Poon, director of the University of Georgia Gerontology Center. \" At present people who could get to that point are not in good health at all.\"", "id": "high2486.txt"}
