Wang, however, said, \"Experts believe this is 'very much needed' for research into relevant (closely connected) technologies to further China's achievements in space.\"\nThe 68-hour Shenzhou VII mission featured a 25-minute spacewalk on Saturday.\nIt was broadcast live and watched by millions throughout the country. The crew's landing at a site in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region was also carried live by national television.\nThe entire mission was pronounced a complete success.\nWang said the three astronauts, were transported to Hohhot, the region's capital, and would spend the evening there.\n\"They will return to Beijing this morning,\" he said.\n\"During the course of the mission, Russian experts provided strong technical support for the EVA spacesuits. The successful Sino-Russian cooperation for this flight created beneficial conditions for more intensive cooperation between the two sides in the future,\" Wang said.\nThe mission's success has paved the way for completing the second stage of the program--building a space station before 2020.\nBefore that, a space lab will be set up in 2010 with Shenzhou X, the country's next full-crew space journey.", "id": "high20554.txt"}
