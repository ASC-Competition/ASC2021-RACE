The goal of a PSA is not to make a big sale, but rather to change public opinion and raise awareness for a problem.\nSmokey Bear has been a recognized symbol of the protection of America's forests from fire. It is created to educate the public about the dangers of wildfires. Smokey Bear was started in 1944 with the slogan, \"Smokey Bear Says--Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires\". Smokey Bear's later slogan,  \"Remember! Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires\", was created in 1947 by the Advertising Council in America. In April 2001, the message was changed to \"Only You Can Prevent Wildfires\".\nThe wildfire prevention campaign with Smokey Bear is one of the longest and most successful campaigns in advertising history. The Advertising Council often was in partnership with other organizations and groups to create various advertising for Smokey Bear since 1944.\nThe Advertising Council teamed with Walt Disney Company to create a series of PSAs. The ads feature(***)characters form the classic film Sleeping Beauty and aim to reach parents and children. The lovely Bambi also appeared in the advertisements. Mickey Mouse is much more popular throughout the country.\nThose PSAs, which appear on television, on the radio, in the newspaper and on the website continue to remind Americans about the importance of wildfire prevention have helped to reduce the number of acres burned annually by wildfires. According to recent survey, Smokey Bear and his famous words of wisdom \"Only You Can Prevent Wildfires\" are recalled by 3 out of 4 adults.\nIn addition to the PSA campaign, Smokey Bear has his own U.S. postage stamp and website for more information about wildfire prevention. From the website, you can also learn all about wildfires and how we can protect our forests.", "id": "high4782.txt"}
