For most, who speak Spanish at home, it's becoming their third language. They've been learning and using Chinese words since kindergarten, and it's now second nature to give a hearty \"ni hao\" when strangers enter the classroom.\nThe classroom scene at McCormick is unusual, but it may soon be a common fixture  in American schools, where Chinese is rapidly becoming the hot new language. Government officials have long wanted more focus on security--useful languages like Chinese, and pressure from them--as well as from business leaders, politicians, and parents--has driven a quick growth in the number of programs.\nChicago itself is home to the largest effort to include Chinese in US public schools.
