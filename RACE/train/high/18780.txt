Due to the financial crisis, the competition was ever-fierce. My son targeted a company that was located in a coastal city. It was intended to employ only one person among more than twenty candidates, I said to David, \"You should not harbor too much hope for fear that you would feel terribly disappointed when you fail.\" He said to me, \"I am not afraid of disappointment. As long as I try, there will always be hope!\"\nThree young men could enter the final round, which would later decide one person to be employed. Everything seemed to go quite well and David entered the final round in a week.\nUnexpectedly, the interview was unbelievably simple, during which the interviewer only chatted with them for a while. The interview strategies my son prepared were not useful at all. The interviewer said the company would inform them of the result in 3 days. On the morning of the third day, David received the text from the company that he was not employed. David felt disappointed.\nIn nightfall that day, David suddenly told me excitedly on phone that he had been employed. Greatly surprised, I asked him, \"What's the whole matter?\" David told me that he received another text saying that he was employed. David felt very confused about it. Later he found out the first text sent to him was also part of the test in the interview. Three men received the same text this morning and only David's reply was satisfying to the company. I asked my son, \"How did all of you reply?\" My son said, \"One did not reply. The other said \"goodbye\" and I said \"thank you\".\"\nOnly then did I know that my son's \"hope\" came in that way. That is, when you feel disappointed, do not forget to say \"Thank you\" to the one who disappoints you. Actually, it is a piece of cake to say \"Thank you\". Saying \"Thank you\" shows respect for others' work and demonstrates your grand generosity. Therefore, while under the same condition, you will get the upper hand in terms of opportunities compared with others!", "id": "high18780.txt"}
