But the courage and determination Reeve showeed in trying to overcome his paralysis   from a 1995 horse-riding accident went beyond any of the achievements of the comic book hero.\n\"He became a real-life Superman. His heroism, his courage was extraordinary,\" Colin Blakemore, the chief executive of Britain's Medical Research Council said. \"Like many people who suffer some terrible injuries, Christopher Reeve was totally changed by that experience and brought the kind of energy and enthusiasm that made him successful as a film star to an entirely different issue, with huge effect.\"\nReeve, 52, died of heart failure on October 10, 2004 after having treatment for an infected pressure wound without realizing his dream of walking again. But in the nine years since his accident, he made personal progress to regain respect and admiration, founded the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, a non-profit research organization, and used his fame to raise millions of dollars for research into spinal cord injuries.\nHe also provided hope and inspiration to other patients and made speeches to support scientists to be allowed to conduct stem cell research in the hopes of eventually curing paralysis and other illnesses such as diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.\n\"He has been our champion. If you think of spinal injuries, you automatically recall a picture of Christopher Reeve,\" said Paul Smith, executive director of the Spinal Injuries Association in England. It is because of Reeve that spinal cord injuries and stem cell research are so widely discussed, according to Smith. The fact that it happened to Reeve showed it can affect anyone, even Superman.\nReeve did not live long enough to see whether stem cell research could help restore movement to the paralyzed. The research is still in its early days and no one knows what advances it may bring.", "id": "high12986.txt"}
