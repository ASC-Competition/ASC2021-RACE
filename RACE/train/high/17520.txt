Called the City of Water, Venice was built about 1,500 years ago. It's made up of 118 tiny islands in the Adriatic Sea. The area, however, may be in over its head. But now scientists have a new plan to save the city.\nBecause the city was built on soft soil, it has been sinking under the pressure of its own weight. Scientists estimate that Venice sinks at a rate of nearly 2 inches every 100 years. Rising sea levels could make Venice go under even faster, some experts say. Earth's temperature is slowly increasing. That is causing sea ice to melt, which makes the world's waters rise, they say.\nTo keep the city afloat, experts want to pump about 40 billion gallons of sea water beneath Venice. The liquid would expand the sand under the city, which would help support the islands, explains lead scientist Giuseppe Gambolati.\nExperts are rushing to save Venice because of its rich history. The city was once a strong sea power. \"Many famous artists and opera singers have come from Venice. Some of the world's greatest paintings can be found on the city's museum walls,\" explains Melissa Conn, who is a director of Save Venice Inc.\nWhile scientists work to get their water-pumping plan approved, Venice's residents go about their normal routines. When the tide rolls in, the locals have ways of keeping everyone dry. Cafe owners move tables to higher ground, and hotels pass out high boots to guests.\nStill, dealing with the rising water does not give the city's residents a sinking feeling, just ask Erla Zwingle. She has lived in Venice for 17 years. \"There has always been high water in Venice.\" Zwingle told WR News. \"If high water really were a serious problem, people wouldn't be still living here.\"", "id": "high17520.txt"}
