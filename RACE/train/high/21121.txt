She hopes that players will use their new skills to make the real world better.\nAccording to Jane, our addiction to gaming is actually a great thing, so long as we use it properly.Speaking at the TED (Technology/Entertainment/Design)2010 Conference, Jane says that people should devote more time to games to build the skills necessary to make the world better.People who take part in MMORPGs develop specialized skills in problem-solving as a team.So, if gamers are willing to take part in role-playing games based on real-world problems,they will be able to work together to find ways that can be used in the real world.\nJane focuses on creating the kinds of video games that enable players to make a difference in their own lives and the lives of those around them.In 2007, she helped create a video game called A World Without Oil, in which 1, 800 players tried to find new ways to transport themselves in a world without oil.Even after completing the game, the players focused on the problem and its possible solutions.Her next game, Evoke, takes an even more practical way.Game players are mainly young people in Africa.They will learn to create a business that will help stop problems such as poverty and AIDS on a local level.By the end of the game, players will be guided by experts on how to start their own businesses.\n\"We can make any future we imagine and we can play any games we want,\" she said at the TED Conference.\"So let the world-changing games begin.\"", "id": "high21121.txt"}
