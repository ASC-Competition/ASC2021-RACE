The schemes are one effort to get control over greenhouse gases in an economy still hungry for cheap energy.\nIt has been a persistent concern in recent years, but the spiking pollution levels in January are sparking a public outcry.\nEmissions from coal-fired electricity plants and busy factories are part of the problem that officials hope to get control over through carbon trading platforms. Seven cities are expected to open carbon markets later this year, including Tianjin.\n\"The government has decided to start with programs because the carbon trading is something new to China,\" said David Tang, secretary of the board of the Tianjin Carbon Exchange. \"So we want to have a number of programs to explore the use of the market.\" said Tang.\nChina wants to launch a national carbon trading program by 2016.
