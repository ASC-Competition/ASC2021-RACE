It was a tall young man, smoking.\nHe had an almost black face, though red and smooth. His moustache was black with curled points, though he could not be more than twenty three or--four. There was an unusual force in his face, and in his daring rolling eyes. \n\"Well, my beauty, what can I do for you?\" said he, coming forward. And seeing that she was quite at a loss, \"Never mind me. I am Mr. d'Urberville. Have you come to see me or my mother?\"\nThis differed greatly from what Tess had expected. She had dreamed of an aged and dignified face. She tried to keep calm and answered-- \"I came to see your mother, sir.\" \n\"I am afraid you cannot see her--she is ill in bed,\" replied the representative of the house; for this was Mr. Alee, the only son of the noble family. \"What is the business you wish to see her about?\"\n\"It isn't business--it is--I can hardly say what!\" \n\"Pleasure?\"\n\"Oh no. Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem...\"\nTess's sense of a certain ridicule was now so strong that, despite her general discomfort at being here, her rosy lips curved  towards a smile, much to the attraction of the young man.\n\"It is so foolish\", she stammered . \"I fear I can't tell you!\"\n\"Never mind; I like foolish things. Try again, my dear,\" said he kindly.\n\"Mother asked me to come,\" Tess continued; \"and, indeed, I was in the mind to do so myself. But I did not think it would be like this. I came, sir, to tell you that we are of the same family as you.\"\n\"Ho! Poor relations?\" \n\"Yes.\" \n\"Stokes?\"\n\"No; d'Urbervilles.\"\n\"Ay, ay; I mean d'Urbervilles.\"\n\"Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but we have several proofs that we are d'Urbervilles. The local scholars hold the view that we are, and...and we have an old seal  and a silver spoon marked with the same castle as yours. So mother said we ought to make ourselves known to you, as we've lost our horse by a bad accident; we can hardly make a living.\"\n   \"Very kind of your mother, I'm sure.\" Alec looked at Tess as he spoke, in a way that made her uneasy. \"And so, my pretty girl, you've come on a friendly visit to us, as relations?\"\n\"I suppose I have,\" looking less confident and uncomfortable again.\n\"Well--there's no harm in it. Where do you live? What are you?\"\n                                    ---Tess of the d'Urbervilles By Thomas Hardy", "id": "high17890.txt"}
