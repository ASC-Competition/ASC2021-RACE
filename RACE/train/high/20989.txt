They came back to Argentina in2004,but settled there only for a couple of weeks, before deciding the open road is the only way to live. They have been traveling ever since, with a trip around South America between 2005 and 2007, then central America, the U.S. and Canada until 2009.The car was shipped to Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea as they traveled those countries and they are currently in the Philippines on a tour of South East Asia.\nAs a proof that life is possible in such a mobile style, the family of the two slowly grew to a number of six.They became, over the years and while on the road, parents to four children, Pampa (eight), Tehue (five), Paloma (three) and Wallaby (one). Remarkably, each of their kids has a different nationality.\n\"My grandfather knew that we wanted to travel and to never stop so he gave me the old Grdham-Paige car he used on his farm,\" Herman said. Each night the six Zapps either sleep in or around a tent set up next to their car, but more often than not they find a friendly local who will put them up for the night.The only hard rule the couple have to stick by, is the 40mph speed limit the 83-year old car is restricted to.\nTheir trip is supported with the money coming from selling books they write about the places they visit.", "id": "high20989.txt"}
