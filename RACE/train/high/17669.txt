The move aims to protect environment of Kanas, a scenic site that is part of the European ecosystem and bordersprefix = st1 /Kazakhstan,RussiaandMongolia. Meanwhile, construction of environmental facilities including sewage  and rubbish treatment plants will be completed soon.\nAccording to Mao Ken, chief of AltayPrefecturewhere Kanas is located, the government invested 1 billion yuan (US $ 120 million) on environmental facilities. \"Education for tourists is also important,\" he said. An education center is being created to provide information on how to protect the environment in Kanas. But he vowed that the government would not interfere with the lives of traditional residents in Kanas.\nIt is expected that Kanas will receive more than 500,000 tourists this year, 4,000 more than last year, according to the official. \"However, there are still few overseas visitors,\" he said. Statistics showed that only 2 percent of the total number of tourists is foreigners. \"This is partly because the transportation facilities connecting Kanas are still not convenient enough,\" Mao said. At present, there is only one highway connecting Kanas.\n\"Upon request from tourists, construction of an airport will start this month and will be completed by the end of next year,\" the official said. A railway line connecting Kuitun and Altay will also open to traffic in 2008 to make it possible to travel to Kanas by train, probably bringing in more tourists.", "id": "high17669.txt"}
