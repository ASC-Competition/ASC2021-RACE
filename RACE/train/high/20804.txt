The five-part series, to be broadcast from Thursday July 14 at 8:30 p.m. on ABC TV, also looks at the scientists' work for the future of mankind.\nThe scientists were a small group of pioneers who explored a world too small to see. What they found there answered some eternal questions--What is life? How is it made ? Why are children like their parents?\nDNA is without doubt the most powerful substance on earth. The order of its chemicals determines whether a child has her mother's eyes or her father's smile. But as DNA shows, until 50 years ago, almost no one knew of its existence. All that changed when two unknown scientists - Jim Watson and Francis Crick -ran into a pub in Cambridge shouting that they'd found the secret of life.\nThis declaration heralded a momentous discovery, not just for the human race but for the people involved. As this program shows, it was one of the most heated scientific races the world has ever seen.\nDr Watson takes us back 50 years, guiding us through the tumultuous events that led to the creation of a double helix  model being built by Dr Francis Crick and himself. He tells how he and Crick try hard to find the double helix first and win the Noble Prize.\nThe program shows others involved with the DNA story, including Maurice Wilkins, who helped create the atom bomb. He became disillusioned  with the science of death and chose the science of life instead, by looking for the structure of DNA.", "id": "high20804.txt"}
