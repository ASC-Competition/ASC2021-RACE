While waiting, she bought a book and a pack of biscuits to spend the time. She looked for a place to sit and waited. She was reading her book, when suddenly she realized that there was a young man sitting next to her who was stretching his hand, and grabbing the pack of cookies lying between them. He started to eat them one by one. Not wanting to make a fuss about it ,she decided to ignore him. The woman ate the biscuits and watched the clock, while the young thief was also eating them. The woman started to think, \"If I weren't such a good and educated person, I would have hit this man by now.\"\nEvery time she ate a biscuit, he had one, too. The dialogue between their eyes continued and when only one biscuit was left, she wondered what he was going to do. Softly and with a nervous smile, the young man grabbed the last biscuit and broke it into two. He offered one half to the woman while he ate the other half. Briskly she took the biscuit and thought, \"What a bad man! How uneducated! He didn't even thank me!\"\nShe had never met anybody who made her so angry, and was pleased when her flight was ready. She grabbed her bags and went towards the gate not looking back to where that thief was seated. After getting on the plane and being seated, she looked for her book which was almost finished by now. While looking into her bag she was totally surprised to find her pack of biscuits. \"If my biscuits are here,\" she thought, feeling bad, \"those others were his and he tried to share them with me.\"Too late to say sorry to the young man, she realized with pain, that it was her who had been an uneducated thief, but not him.", "id": "high19150.txt"}
