The future of US joining in the ISS is closely tied to the result of the examination.\nMr Dordain, the European Space Agency's (Esa) Director General, said no one partner in the ISS project could alone call an end to the platform. A meeting would be held in Japan later in the year where he hoped the partners could get something clearly going forward. He said it was also necessary the benefits  were increased and the costs were reduced. Increasing the benefits could include finding new uses for the station.\nEsa has called for ideas on how to use the ISS as a platform for Earth observation . Mr Dordain said the agency had received about 20 very good proposals.\nOn the issue of reducing costs, there were many ideas on the table, he explained.\nHe also questioned whether it was necessary for the station to have six astronauts at all times. If there were periods when little maintenance  was required or the experiment load was light, could the ISS run on a smaller group of people, he suggested.\nConstruction of the space station should finish this year. Next month, two _ s built in Europe - a connecting node and a robotic control room - will be flown to the platform by the US shuttle Endeavour.\nTranquility and the Cupola, as they are known, will complete the non-Russian side of the ISS.", "id": "high3062.txt"}
