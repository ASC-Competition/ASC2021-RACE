Is it because there are many criminals stealing cars? Not indeed. Rather, it's because of good-hearted neighbors who want to share their harvest.\nSharon recently had a good year for tomatoes. She and her family had eaten and canned so many that they'd begun to feel their skin turn slightly red. That's when she decided it was time to share her blessings. Eventually she found a neighbor willing to have the tomatoes.\"Feel free to take whatever you want,\"Sharon told her. Later that day, Sharon found that her garden had indeed been harvested. She thought it a good way to help someone and the food didn't go to waste.\nA few days later, the neighbor knocked at the door, holding a loaf of bread:\"I want to thank you for all of the tomatoes, and I have to admit that I took a few other things and hoped you wouldn't mind.\"Sharon couldn't think of anything in her garden that had been worth harvesting and said so.\"But you did,\"the neighbor said.\"You had some of the prettiest zucchini.\"\nSharon was confused. She hadn't even planted any zucchini. But her neighbor insisted that there were bright green zucchini. Sharon's curiosity got the better of her and she had to go to see where the zucchini had grown. When the neighbor pointed at the long green vegetables, Sharon smiled.\"Well, actually, those are cucumbers that we never harvested, because they got too big, soft and bitter.\"\nThe neighbor looked at Sharon, shock written all over her face. She hesitated a few times, and then smiling, held out the bread, part of a batch   she had shared all over the neighborhood,\"I brought you a loaf of cucumber bread. I hope you like it.\"", "id": "high19552.txt"}
