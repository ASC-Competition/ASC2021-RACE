We interviewed several students from the US and Canada. Here is what they have told us about their Thanksgiving experiences.\nJosie from New York, USA\n\"In America, Thanksgiving is celebrated every year at the end of November. It is to remember the first group of people from Europe to live in America. When they first arrived, they found the environment strange. But they learned to survive after some native American friends showed them how to grow and find food. Thanksgiving is meant to be a traditional celebration.\"\nTodd from California,   USA\n\"Thanksgiving is the first day of Christmas shopping. That means we have four weeks to buy Christmas presents for our families and friends. For me and my friends, the most important part of the festival is the big football game on TV. The match is watched by millions of people all over America. Thanksgiving is seen as an exciting day for football!\"\nIan from Saskatoon, Canada\nIn Canada, Thanksgiving is held on the 2nd Monday in October. On the Sunday before Thanksgiving Day, many people go to church. Thanks is given for all the good things that happened to them during the year. I always give thanks for the nice big turkey I'm going to have at the family dinner! Like all festivals, Thanksgiving is about food!\nKatie from Maritimes, Canada\nOn Thanksgiving Day, we have dinner with all our cousins, aunts and uncles. It is always very busy. Sometimes we have two Thanksgiving dinners because we go to both our grandparents' houses. The dinner is usually attended by more than twenty people at each house! My mother and my aunts do all the cooking but the washing-up is done by me and my cousins. And that's not an easy job! But I don't mind because Thanksgiving is meant to be a time to give thanks.", "id": "high1576.txt"}
