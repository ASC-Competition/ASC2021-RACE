When we fail to meet her needs, she gently leads us in the proper direction. When I forget to fill her water bowl early in the morning, she runs after my legs, and then pushes me in the direction of her bowl. She doesn't get irritated  ; instead, she expresses her wishes in the best way. And I always understand what she is telling me.\nOne day I found myself envying   her simple expression. How many times had I expected my husband or my children to know my wants without my ever giving voice to them? How many times had I been disappointed that they couldn't understand when I needed a hug, a compliment   or a chocolate bar?\nAfter a pleasant afternoon with my husband, I wanted to stop somewhere nice and have dinner, but he didn't understand my hints  . \"Couldn't you see that I wanted to go out to dinner?\" I complained when he pulled into our driveway.\n\"Why didn't you say so?
