But it is still widely practiced, with the groom's family demanding even more money after marriage, leading to mental and physical annoyance that can drive the woman to suicide.\n\"The Angry Brides game is our way of throwing a spotlight on the nuisance of dowry.\" said Ram Bhamidi, senior vice president and head of online marketing for Shaadi.com, a matrimonial website with two million members.\n\"According to a 2007 study, there is a dowry-related death every four hours in India, We condemn this and have consistently run campaigns on social media to help create awareness of the issue\".\nThe name of the app, available on the group's home page, is a  _ from the globally popular \"Angry Birds\" game, Its home page shows a red-clad, eight-armed woman resembling a powerful female Hindu goddess. Underneath, there is a caption: \"A woman will give you strength, care and all the love you need ......NOT dowry!\"\nTo play the game, users have to try and hit three dodging grooms--a pilot, a builder and a doctor. There are a variety of weapons to choose from, including a frying pan, broomstick, tomato and loafer.\nEach groom has a price tag, starting at 1.5 million rupees($29,165). Every time the player hits a groom, his value decreases and money is added to the player's Anti-Dowry Fund, which is saved posted on their Facebook page.\n\"Since we launched the game last week, more than 270,000 people have liked the app. Both men and women seem to be playing it\", said Bhamidi.", "id": "high22765.txt"}
