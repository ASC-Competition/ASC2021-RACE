Just as we were about to board the plane, a mechanic came out of the aircraft and blocked the door with his arms. He turned to the flight attendant and hurriedly stated, \"We got problems!\"\nI thought to myself, \"Why did I have to be the one to hear that? Why couldn't I have been at the back of the line? I didn't need to know that!\" Very soon we were back in the terminal, waiting, and then finally back on the plane. I waited for the pilot to give an explanation. Pilots take courses to ease passengers' mind, right? They know what to say to calm nerves.\nUnfortunately, I didn't think this pilot took that course. Soon his voice thundered throughout the plane, \"Sorry for the delay, ladies and gentlemen. We had no power on the plane. We have a generator on the ground right now, and we're going to jump-start the engines. Once we get them going, we'll get up in the air and head to Norfolk, and see what happens.\" \nSee what happens? We were going to get up in the air, and see what happens? Couldn't we have another plan, one that's been worked out just a little better?\nAt this point, all I could do was to laugh nervously. One woman started yelling, \"Oh no! We're going to crash!\" There were sighs of desperation and anxiety spreading throughout the cabin. Finally, we got up in the air thirty minutes later, and what happened? Nothing ---other than thrust   and lift. We arrived in Norfolk, and no sooner had the wheels touched the ground than a round of applause burst out, as everyone throughout the airplane simultaneously   breathed a sigh of relief.\nAlthough, I did sincerely like to have a plan better than \"see what happens\" worked out when flying --- it really isn't such a bad life strategy. Success will never be guaranteed. The best thing you can do is just get up in the air, and see what happens. Sometimes adjustments would be made in the air, or shall we say, in the middle of the process.", "id": "high16687.txt"}
