What's worse, while there are around 6,000 or 7,000 languages spoken around the world today, researchers estimate that fifty percent of those languages will not survive the turn of the century.\nGoogle, however, is determined to provide a safe place for some of these dying languages. Recently, the company started the Endangered Languages Project. It is an online archive  that will use technology and media to protect endangered languages around the world. Google hopes the archive will allow people to do something for endangered languages by offering tools that will help create high-quality recordings of the last speakers of a language. \nThe site makes it possible for users to share research and video documents that will support endangered languages, as well as connect people who are working to protect specific languages. Languages on the site are put into different types, such as, \"at risk\", \"endangered\" and \"seriously endangered\". Navajo, a language spoken mainly in New Mexico today, is listed as \"at risk\", with about 120,000 speakers worldwide.\nIf the Endangered Languages Project works, it may not only help protect Navajo, but also help protect hundreds of other languages. And while these languages may never become the language of international business, making sure that they don't disappear is important -- to protect out cultural heritage and to provide us with valuable information that can help us to better understand ourselves.", "id": "high22478.txt"}
