Similarly, \"window treatments\" frame the window. but the use of European-style net curtains to screen out nosy neighbors is rare. In the same style, first-time visitors to an American home may be proudly given the full tour; even walk-in closets and en suite bathrooms are not considered off-limits. They may also be encouraged to help themselves to a soda from the fridge. All this gives an impression of openness.\nYet Americans do value their personal space and privacy. A Brazilian expatriate   who dropped in on her usually friendly Connecticut neighbors unannounced got the clear impression she should have called first. Similarly while a typical suburban home features large, shared areas, such as an open-plan kitchen and family room or \"den\", ample private space is also allowed in the floor plan. A visit to a family home in the evening would likely find the family members dispersed, each independently watching TV, on the phone, surfing the Internet, or otherwise _ in the privacy of their own bedroom.\nAmerican individualism, expansiveness, and abundance are expressed in lifestyle. Despite the fact that the average household size has declined over the past thirty years from3.1 people to 2.6 people per household, the average size of a new family home increased during the same period from 1,500 to 2,200 square feet.\nA common observation is just how outsized everything is. The beds are king-sized, the TVs have giant screens, the burgers are \"whoppers  ,\" appliances are \"industrial\" size. The largest popcorn or soda at the movies can be \"supersized.\" Closets are \"walk in,\" and some cars are the size of a military vehicle.", "id": "high5347.txt"}
