In keeping with its eco-development, the machine uses the same amount of electricity as three lights.    Inventor Jonathan Ritchey said, \"The demand for water is off the chart. So people are looking for freedom from water distribution systems that are shaky and unreliable.\"\nThe machine, which is about 3 feet wide, is likely to cost PS800 when it goes on sale here in the spring. Its maker, Canadian Firm Element Four, roughly calculates that a liter of water costs around 20 pence to produce.\nEnvironmentalists state that half the world's population will face water shortage because of climate change by 2080. One in five is said to lack access to safe drinking.\nThe Water Mill is not effective in areas where the amount of water contained in the air is below about 30 percent, but in Britain that won't be much of a problem.", "id": "high16272.txt"}
