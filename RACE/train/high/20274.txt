Emma Watson, who is Hermione Granger in the movies, said she looked forward to \"finally being free, being my own person\" - a change signaled by her new haircut.\nDaniel Radcliffe, who has been the face of the boy wizard since 2001, said that he \"did cry like a little girl\" when the last movie finished.\n\"It's like the ending of a relationship,\" he toldThe Vancouver Sun. \"There's a sense of, 'God, what am I going to do now?'\" He said he was eager to see \"what life holds for him beyond Hogwarts\".\nAlong with the three actors, Harry Potter fans, now in their late teens, came of age with J.K.

We grew up, so did he.\"\nFor Emily Chahal, an 18-year-old student, the series has been an inspiring journey. \"That first book was what started my love of literature. It was the inspiration for everything - really teaching me to appreciate my friends, and to face difficulties with a sense of courage,\" she said. \"I have a sense of sadness. The end of the movies is kind of the end of my childhood, too.\"\nFortunately, to the delight of die-hard fans, there are many things that keep the boy wizard alive. For example, in June this year, a Harry Potter theme park opened in Florida, US.\nSome schools in the US and UK also have Quidditch teams - players ride broomsticks. \"We're not waiting anymore to see what happens to Harry next,\" Hill told The Vancouver Sun. She founded a Quidditch club at Carleton University in Canada. \"We're still engaged in that magical world.\"", "id": "high20274.txt"}
