Between 1849 and 1882, more than 30,000 Chinese came to California. Most were men. They had been farmers in China. They came here to be miners and laborers. They ended up doing many other jobs, too.\nLike many other immigrants, they did not plan to stay in America. They came because of their ties to their homeland and their families. They planned to return to China with their fortunes and help their families.\nOnly a few Chinese gold miners struck it rich. Most picked over the areas that had been mined already. But still, white miners _ the Chinese. Slowly, they drove the \"yellow peril\" from the mining camps.\nBy the end of the 1850s, many Chinese returned home. Those who stayed found other jobs.\nFew women had come west in the gold rush. The Chinese saw a good business opportunity. They began doing the jobs women would have done. Many became house servants. Many more opened laundries.\nThe Chinese opened restaurants. Chop suey and show mein are popular Chinese-American dishes. The Chinese probably created these dishes to serve to the white miners. Other Chinese became fishermen, farmers, and even cigar makers.", "id": "high4790.txt"}
