Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days.\nHer parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, \"she is weak but so strong. We've never seen any child stronger than her. It seems as if nothing in the world could beat her. We really hope to send her to school next year.\" She used to drive on the local playground, but Bea was only allowed to watch sitting in the car. \"It was heartbreaking to see Bea staring at the running and laughing children there. She never stopped fighting the disease. I know she's dying for such a normal life.\"\nHearing of Bea's story, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has paid for a play park to be built in her back garden. \"Bea is very brave and she has encouraged many children like her,\" said the chairman of the foundation.", "id": "high17427.txt"}
