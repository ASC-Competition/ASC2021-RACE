Expo gives you a unique opportunity to meet leading industrialists and educators.\nI spoke to several young people at Expo, and they all agreed how useful it was to have so much information under one roof.\nDuncan Kelly intends to take a university course in design after he leaves school. He was collecting some of the free literature when I spoke to him. \"I'm not in a hurry to make a choice at the moment. I want to get all the information before I make up my mind.\"\nOne feature of Expo is the careers seminars  , at which expert speakers outline their respective fields. Barbara Watts is already at university, in the second year of a law degree. She's decided to keep on studying after she graduates. She attended a seminar on international law. \"The speaker was really good at getting across his message,\" said Barbara. \"It was very helpful.\"\nBut Expo isn't just for people who are still in education. It also offers help to those in employment, and to people who are considering retraining or a change of career.\nOne advantage of Expo in that you can meet many prospective employers face to face, and talk to them frankly about your plans. As Charles Li told me, \"Normally I wouldn't dare to go and talk to the manager of a company. But today I have talked to several managers. It's easy to meet them here, in a relaxed environment.\" He left school after Junior High and went to work in a factory to earn a living. He's looking at changing his career and perhaps tidying to be an accountant.\nThe organizers expect over 200,000 young people to visit Expo, and there's no doubt that it's a bit of a squash  . But the opportunities available here certainly make up for any discomfort. So, if you need any help with your future, come along to Expo. You don't need a ticket. It's open today, Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 7 pm, and entry is free to all.", "id": "high24106.txt"}
