All my friends in middle school went to other schools. I wanted to make some new friends. However, I was shy and wasn't good at making new friends. On my first day at school, I looked at others who were talking in groups happily. How I wish I were one of them!\nI guess I was very lucky then. At lunch in the dinning hall, when I was eating at a table alone, a girl came to me. \"Excuse me, is this seat taken?\" she asked. I immediately shook my head. She smiled and sat down opposite  to me. I felt a little _ and didn't know what to say at all, but I really wanted to communicate with her. It was a good opportunity to make friends with her. When I looked up, I found she was smiling at me. Her smile calmed me down. \"I really like this school. It's beautiful, but I don't know anyone here. All my friends went to other schools,\" said the girl. Hearing her words, I immediately said, \"my friends are not here either. Can we be friends?\" I was surprised. I couldn't believe I would say something like that, and to my surprise, that girl immediately said \"yes\". We both smiled.\nWe became very good friends. Now it's the beginning of a new term again. Many students may have no friends at their new schools. If you are also as shy as I used to be, please don't be afraid to talk to others. You may get a surprise and make a new friend. After all, others want to make new friends, too.", "id": "high8632.txt"}
