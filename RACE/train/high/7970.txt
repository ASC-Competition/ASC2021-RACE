But Echo had one failing; she was fond of talking, and whether in chat or argument, would have the last word. As she was good company, she and Zeus became good friends. However, Zeus' wife, Hera, became jealous. She followed Zeus to the earth to find out what he was doing and Zeus asked Echo to distract Hera until he could escape. Later when Hera discovered she had been tricked, she became very angry. She turned on Echo and said, \"You shall lose the use of your tongue because you cheated me. You'll have the last word, bur no longer have the power to speak first.\" So from that moment on, Beautiful Echo was hardly able to hold a conversation because she could only repeat the last words of those around her. She became very embarrassed and hid herself deep in the woods.\nOne day a handsome young man called Narcissus came into the woods. He had been hunting deer and lost his way. However, the moment Echo saw him, she fell in love with him. She followed him, wishing to tell him but unable to begin a conversation. Oh, how she wished she could speak first. Unfortunately, Narcissus was far too busy worrying about where his companions might be and how he could find his way home.\nEventually Narcissus, with Echo following behind along, came to a pool of water in the middle of the woods. Feeling thirsty, Narcissus bent down to drink. As he did so, he saw a beautiful creature in the water staring up at him. He immediately bent over and said to him, \"I love you!\" Echo, nearby, and seeing her chance, immediately responded \".... I love you!\" But it was too late. Narcissus was already in love, with himself.\nThe stranger seemed to rise up closer to Narcissus who was so involved that he entirely failed to notice Echo. \"I want to stay and look at this beautiful sight forever,\" he whispered dreamily to himself.\"... Forever,\" repeated Echo sadly. \"Come here,\" called Narcissus to his reflection as he moved his head and the creature seemed to move away. \"...Here.\" responded Echo. Narcissus bent back down to see his reflection more clearly. \"So beautiful! I've never seen anything so beautiful!\" \"....So beautiful!\" responded Echo truthfully.\nNarcissus remained by the water refusing all Echo's silent offers of food and drink until he died. Where he had been, a flower grew in his place, as beautiful as Narcissus himself. As for Echo, from that time forward, she also didn't eat or drink till she turned to rocks and all that was left was her voice. Even now you can still hear Echo trying to attract Narcissus' attention by repeating his words and still see Narcissus as a beautiful flower growing near a pool.", "id": "high7970.txt"}
