He lets me use his house to hold events to raise money for youth at risk programs.\nThe last time I was there he greeted me by saying, \"I want to tell you why I let you use my house. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of a poor horse trainer who would go from stable   to stable, farm to farm, training horses. As a result, the boy's high school was continually interrupted  . One day in the last year of high school, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to do when he grew up.\n\"He wrote a seven-page paper about his goal of owning a horse ranch in great detail. He put a great deal of his heart into the project and even drew a detailed floor plan for the dream ranch. Then the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. But he got a low mark with a note that read, 'See me after class.'  \"The boy went to see the teacher after class and asked, 'Why did I receive a low mark?'\"\n\"The teacher said, 'This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from a poor family. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, 'If you will rewrite this paper, I will reconsider your mark.'\n\"The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, 'Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.'\n\"Finally, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He wrote, 'You can keep the low mark and I'll keep my dream.'\"", "id": "high5076.txt"}
