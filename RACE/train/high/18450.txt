I have always had a weakness for old people; they break my heart, especially the ones begging on the streets, or selling flowers, I feel sad for them, having to be on the streets instead of being taken care of by their families or the government.\n              There was a car in front of us before we reach next to him. I had prepared money in my hand to give it to him, and I was looking at the car in front of us when the driver took a bill of money and threw it off the window--he threw it in the face of the old man and it fell on the ground, in a wet spot. The old man looked at the bill with a sad look, knowing it would take him an enormous effort to pick it up and he was hardly standing up, so I opened the car door, ran to him as he was bending to pick it up, took it, wiped it with my jeans since it was almost wet, gave it to him and gave him the money I had prepared for him.\n              The look on his face when he saw me doing that was the most rewarding look anyone has ever given me. He was shocked, and started thanking me for what I did and asking God to bless me, but I couldn't hear a word of what he was saying, I couldn't look him in the eye, how can someone so sweet like him with a kind and gentle look be left on the streets?\n              Helping him out surely made his day, but what he didn't know is that he affected me in a way he could never imagine--I still think about him very often, and I just hope everyone will look at old people the way I do.", "id": "high18450.txt"}
