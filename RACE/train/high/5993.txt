Children spending 3 or more hours a day watching TV, playing computer games or chatting with friends were classified as sedentary.\nThe researchers found only a quarter of the boys and 15 percent of the girls were getting enough exercise by these definitions. A quarter of boys and nearly 30% of girls were sedentary and didn't get enough exercise with girls less active than boys in every country aside from Zambia.\nGirls from India were the most active with 37 percent meeting exercise recommendation, while girls from Egypt were the least active with 4 percent getting enough exercise. Children in Myanmar were the least sedentary while the most sedentary nations were St .Lucia and the Cayman Islands.\nPeople show deep concern for kids' lack of physical activity in various nations. Why do they have a low level of physical activity? Guthold speculated that urbanization could be a factor as well as easy access to cars and TVs.", "id": "high5993.txt"}
