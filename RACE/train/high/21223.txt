This Ms. Boyle, looking unfashionable, from a village in Scotland, shocked the three judges and the audience with the song \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from the musical Les Miserables on a show of \"Britain's Got Talent\", one of the hottest reality shows in Britain.\nShe couldn't hide the awkwardness when walking to the center of the stage in a housedress, and everyone--including the judges--seemed laughing at her when she said she wanted to be as successful as Elaine Paige. As soon as she began singing, however, everyone present fell silent, then rose within seconds to applaud her incredible voice as the celebrity  judges sat open-mouthed, and remained standing to the end.\nAfter her performance, one of the judges Piers Morgan said, \"Without doubt that was the biggest surprise I've had in three years of this show. When you stood there everyone was laughing at you. No one is laughing now. That was amazing.\" Actress Amanda Holden followed, \"I am so thrilled because I know that everybody was against you. I honestly think that we were all being cynical and I think that's the biggest wake-up call ever.\"\nSusan obviously won over the hearts of millions around the world with sensation spreading across the Atlantic. Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore--who between them have nearly 1.5 million followers--speak highly of her. Kutcher posted a link to the video clip . The Scottish talent made her live American debut  via satellite connection on CBS's The Early Show, doing an interview and singing live from her room. And she already accepted an invitation from talk show host Oprah Winfrey.\nNow Boyle has become one of the world's hottest celebrities. The video clip of her performance has been viewed more than 50 million times on YouTube, becoming a hit on the Internet. Not long ago she came to China and was warmly welcomed.", "id": "high21223.txt"}
