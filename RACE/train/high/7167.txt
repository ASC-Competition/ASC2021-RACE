The lessons,whether they are flashcards,quizzes,audio recordings or written and spoken essays,are delivered through the Intemet.\nMichael Schutzler, Livemocha's chief executive , says the website's advantage is the ability to practicel with a real person. \"The great irony is that even if you have learned a foreign language in the classroom for years,you don't have confidefice to go into a restaurant and have a conversation with a foreigner,\"he said.The casual connection with real people throughout the world, however brief, are not just fun and surprising but show more about how the language is really used.\nLivemocha is now experimenting with a variety of ways that resemble the games on other social websites to motivate people.The flashcard exercises,for instance,are scored, and the totals earned by studying and teaching appear on the users'front page.\nBesides,each person can set up a profile which includes a short description of his age,location and what language he would like to learn.Therefore,if you want to study one language,you will easily find many people who are fluent in it.Andl an email or two is all it takes to find a study partner.\nThere are more and more companies like Livemocha offeritig online language learning to students throughout the world. And instead of merely helping people practice different languages,they also enable people to share interests and make new friends.", "id": "high7167.txt"}
