But being half the size of the other boys, he got  ly nowhere. This teenager lived alone with his father. Even though the boy was always standing on the bench , his father was always standing with cheering. He never missed a game. This young man was still the smallest of the class when he entered high school. But his father continued to encourage him.\nWhen the young man went to college, he always put his heart and soul to every practice. This persistent young athlete never missed practice during his four years at college, but he never got to play in a game.\nIt was the end of his last football season, and he entered the practice field, the coach met him with a telegram. The young man read the telegram and became silent. He said to the coach, \"My father died this morning.\" the coach said, \"Take the rest of the week off, son.\"\nThe big game arrived and it was not going well. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a silent man said quietly to the coach. \"Coach, please let me play,\" said the young man. Before long, the players and everyone in the stands could not believe their eyes. This little unknown, who had never played before, was doing everything right. His team finally won.\nHe looked at the coach, with tears in his eyes, and said, \"Well you know my dad died, but did you know that my dad was blind?\" the young man said, \"Dad came to all my games, but today was the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to show him I could do it!\"", "id": "high21874.txt"}
