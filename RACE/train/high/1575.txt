His uncle told him to solve mathematical problems by pretending to be a policeman. \"You are looking for someone,\" he said, \"but you don't know who he is. Call him X. Find him by using your mathematical tools.\"\nAlbert learned to love mathematics. He was studying the _ mathematics of calculus while all his friends were still studying simple mathematics. Instead of playing with his friends he thought about things such as \"What would happen if people could travel at the speed of his light?\"\nAlbert wanted to teach mathematics and physics. He graduated with honors, but it was a pity that he could not get a teaching job.", "id": "high1575.txt"}
