Our ancestorshad poems about the importance of frugality   in the consumption of food. But it makes a lot of sensewhen many are yet to have the awareness that food waste borders on a crime.\nThe campaign has been started online and thousands of people have answered the call. Manyrestaurants have joined the program by announcing that customers are encouraged to order half a dish andtake home what they can't finish.\nHowever, it is estimated   that 50 million tons of grain are wasted every year in China, enough tofeed 200 million people for a year.\nTrue, official banquets   paid with public money contribute much to such waste. But it isimportant that everyone thinks about how they can do their bit to reduce food waste. We need to developthe habit of never ordering or cooking more than we can eat and feeling guilty when we dump ourleftovers.\nMany people have a bad habit of entertaining guests with more than enough food, believing that theyhave not satisfied their guests' appetites if there is no food left on the table. In fact, to be a good host theyorder more than their guests can possibly eat and their guests eat more than they want out of politeness.\nSuch a mentality needs to change. People need to be made aware that it is impolite to force guests toeat more than they are comfortable with and it is insensible and uncivilized to waste food. Even if one iswealthy, ordering more than one can eat is a bad way to show off one's wealth.", "id": "high19209.txt"}
