He sold the stone to a diamond dealer for over three hundred thousand dollars. In New York, the diamond was resold. This time for almost eight hundred thousand dollars.

He picked up his tools and held his breath as he made the first blow. The diamond split   exactly as he promised.", "id": "high7887.txt"}
