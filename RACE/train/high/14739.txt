He'd started stealing things when he was only a kid. He used to walk through the street market near his home and \"pick up\" a few things--an apple, or a hairbrush perhaps. But things got worse as Sam got older. By the time he was twenty-five, he was spending a lot of time stealing and then he got caught. While he was in prison he decided that he'd never steal again. He really had to stop.\nOn his first day out of prison, Sam went for a walk along the High Street. It was so nice to walk along in the crowds and looked at the shops. Oh, the shops!\n\"I'll just go into this jeweler's and have a look around,\" Sam said to himself. \"There's nothing to worry about. No more stealing for me.\" Then Sam saw the diamond ring. He'd always wanted to give one to his girlfriend. And nobody was looking. In a minute the ring was in his pocket and Sam was walking out of the shop. But as he went towards the door he felt a hand on his shoulder, \"I shall have to call the police.\"\n\"I'll pay for it. Yes, I'll pay for it,\" said Sam.\nWith a smile, the manager handed him the bill: 500!\n\"Err, um, well...\" said Sam. \"I really didn't want to spend that much. Would you please show me something a little cheaper?\"", "id": "high14739.txt"}
