Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates delivered the commencement   address at Harvard University on Thursday, and was awarded the L. L. D. honorary doctorate  .\n\"Our speaker is known as the most influential entrepreneur  of the personal computer revolution. He was named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2004, 2005, 2006 and again in 2007, \" said Harvard's president, Derek Bok. Then Bok spoke more directly to Gates: \"Just think what you could have achieved if you had stayed another two years.\"\nGates told the students, many of whom will soon be launching into full-time careers, that work isn't the only thing of importance.\n\"Judge yourself not on the professional accomplishments but on how well you have addressed the world's inequities, how you have treated people who have nothing to do with you,\" he said.\nIn recent months, Gates has been giving a larger part of his time and energy to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which focuses on issues including global health and education. In 2008, he plans to make the foundation his chief responsibility.\nBut for the most part, the Microsoft co-founder stuck to the serious message about trying to make the world a better place. He urged the graduates not to get discouraged about seemingly intractable   challenges of poverty and poor health.\nAs many as 30,000 people were expected to attend the outdoor commencement ceremony. Gates wasn't the only high-profile speaker on the prefix = st1 /Cambridgecampus this week. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton delivered Harvard's Class Day speech.
