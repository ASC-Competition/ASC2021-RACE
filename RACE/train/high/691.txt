Hey, stop! This is no vacation--you have to finish something.\nHere lies the problem for travel writer and foodcritic  Edie Jarolim. \"I always loved traveling and always liked to eat, but it never occurred to me that I could make money doing both of those things,\" Jarolim said. Now you can read her travel advice everywhere--- inArts and Antiques, inBrides, or in one of her three books,The Complete Idiot Travel Guide to Mexican Beach Resorts.\nHer job in travel writing began some eight years ago. After getting a PhD in English in Canada, she took a test for Frommer's travel guides, passed it, and got the job. After working at Frommer's, Jarolim worked for a while at Rough Guides in London, then Fodor's where she fell so in love with a description of the Southwest of the U.S. that she moved there.\nNow as a travel writer, she spends one-third of her year on the road. The rest of the time is spent completing her tasks and writing reviews of restaurants at home in Tucson, Arizona.\nAs adventurous as the job sounds, the hard part is fact-checking all the information. Sure, it's great to write about a tourist attraction, but you'd better get the local museum hours correct or you could really ruin someone's vacation.", "id": "high691.txt"}
