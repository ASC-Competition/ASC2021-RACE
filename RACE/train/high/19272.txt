A mistake on a two-penny stamp has made it worth a million and a half times its face value.\n    Do you think it possible? However, it is true.\n    The mistake was made more than 100 years ago in Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean, which was a British colony at that time. In 1847, an order  for stamps was sent to London. Thus prefix = st1 /Mauritiusbecame the fourth country in the world which had the stamps made in other countries.\n    Before the order was filled ,that is, the stamps arrived from England, a big dance party was planned by the commander-in-chief   of all the armed forces on the island. The party would be held in his house and letters of invitation would be sent to all the important people in Mauritius. So stamps were badly needed to post the letters. Therefore, an islander, who was a good printer, was told to copy the pattern of the stamps. He carelessly put the words \"Post Office\" instead of \"Post Paid\", two words seen on the stamps at that time, on several hundred that he printed.\nToday, there are only 26 of these misprinted stamps left: fourteen One-penny Reds and twelve Two-penny Blues. Because of so few Two-penny Blues and because of their age, collectors have paid as much as $16,800 for each of them.", "id": "high19272.txt"}
