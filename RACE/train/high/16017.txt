It is made up of 10 rotating   members and five permanent members, which have a veto, the power to stop a resolution  . Most UN members now consider the organization's structure outdated. But any changes need the agreement of two-thirds of the 191 members, and no veto from any of the five permanent council members.\nLast year, Japan, Germany, Brazil and India formed a lobbying   group to get permanent council seats. But North and South Korea have doubts about Japan, Italy opposes Germany for a seat, Pakistan is against India's candidacy   and Mexico and Argentina\nBrazil.\nA wave of emotion swept through China last week as millions voiced their opposition to Japan's permanent membership of the United Nations (UN) Security Council. By last Friday over 22 million Chinese had signed an online petition   against Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the council.\nAccording to major Chinese websites, such as sina.com, more than 170,000 overseas Chinese also signed. This is the first online activity of its kind.\nThe petition was started by US-based Alliance for Preserving the Truth of the Sino-Japanese War  . They want Japan to apologize for crimes during World War II. The group also plans to present the petition to the UN this autumn.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said he didn't think the petition shows anti-Japanese feeling. He believed instead it is a request for Japan to take a responsible attitude towards history.", "id": "high16017.txt"}
