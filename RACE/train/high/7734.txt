It was my dear neighbor Susan who helped me get used to my new life far away from home. There was a knock at the door. When I opened it, Susan came in with a home-made apple pie. She hugged me and said:\"You must be the precious Chinese doll!\" With a big smile, she went on:\"Alice, I am sure you have never, ever tried a home-made apple pie before! You are going to love it so much!\" To be honest, I was greatly surprised by this welcome from a stranger. And the apple pie made me feel at home.\nSusan was very helpful to me. When I was thinking about a costume to wear on Halloween, she suggested I dress up like a traditional Chinese girl. \"I happen to have a traditional Chinese dress and guess what, I am a great make-up artist!\" she said. Susan didn't hide her excitement, when, after an hour of hard work, she pushed me to the mirror to examine our work. The clothes fit me perfectly! I am sure that I _ from the crowd that Halloween, and I am very grateful to Susan for her help.\nMy first Thanksgiving was another highlight. On the festival morning, I was surprised to find a gift box in my front yard. There was a note on it:\"Hello Alice, I am the Thanksgiving bunny! Enjoy your gift!\" I looked around and caught Susan looking at me from the porch. Seeing that she had been caught, she awkwardly picked up a newspaper and pretended to read it. I couldn't help laughing. When I walked up to her, she said:\"It was not me. It was the Thanksgiving bunny!\" Susan is such a lovely person; she is the American above all others I need to thank.\nI saw that the spirit of the Chinese saying, that \"Neighbors carry more weight than distant relatives,\" is alive and well in America. Susan filled my heart with warmth and joy, just as angels do.", "id": "high7734.txt"}
