Most pubs have no waiters-you have to go to the bar to buy drinks. A group of Italian youths were waiting 45 minutes before they realized they would have to fetch their own. This may sound inconvenient, but there is a hidden purpose.\nPub culture is designed to promote sociability in a society known for its reserve.
