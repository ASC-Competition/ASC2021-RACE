A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage.\nWanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. \"It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,\" Kamau said of Project X.\nKamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme.\n\"We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,\" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities.\nOne student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, \"I am from the world; I am love,\" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti.\nMany people will give up when there's a language barrier, \"but these students prove them wrong\". Kamau said. \"You do have something to give. You are important. When TV, media, etc. are bringing them down, this program is bringing them up.\"", "id": "high6046.txt"}
