Big Ben and the Tower of London? Lock Ness? Shakespeare's birthplace at Strafford-upon-Avon? There are many famous tourist attractions in the UK and they attract millions of visitors each year. But along with the famous names there are thousands of other interesting places that are only open to the public for a few days each year. Heritage Open Days takes place each September and lets the public visit places that would normally be out of bounds. Among the thousands of historic sites there are castles and factories, town halls and churches. Here we look at some of the places that most tourists might not know about.\nRoman Baths --- Chester\nThese Roman baths are almost two thousand years old and a fascinating insight into the history of the city but they aren't often open to visitors because they are under a clothes shop and a shop that sells baked potatoes! In Open Days week, visitors can go downstairs to the basement of the shops and find a little piece of history.\nTennis Club --- Birmingham\nEdgbaston Tennis Club opened in 1860 and is the oldest tennis club in the world. Visitors can see the club's collection of tennis clothes and equipment and learn about the game's rich history.\nArdman Animation --- Bristol\nThe studios that produced the famous Wallace and Gromit animated films open its doors to the public to let people find out more about how the films are made.\nPaddock Wood --- Kent\nA family house where some of the rooms are unchanged since the 1920s. The home's owner, Sarah Hamilton, is happy to open her doors to the public, saying \"I'm passionate about history and I love taking to people.\"\nThese are just a few of the thousands of places to visit each year. If you're visiting Britain in September ---- look out for Open Days!", "id": "high3719.txt"}
