We knew the restaurant was superior because we could only understand parts of the menu. \"See? I told you there would be a place for me to wear my new spring outfit,\" she shyly reminded me.\n\"Two can play at that game,\" I responded. \"I will wear my gray suit, my Borsalino imported straw hat and a new silk tie. We will be dressed very well. This town will never be the same. Almost like our first date.\"\nIt was early spring and nearing dusk as the head waiter showed us to a table by a window, with a view of the river. The table was beautifully set, with a smoke-gray tablecloth decorated by bright red napkins, lemon slices in the long-stemmed water glasses, fresh flowers. A delicious meal served in such an atmosphere should be remembered a long time. As it turned out, this would probably never be forgotten.\nAs the shadows lengthened, the riverboats rocking in the river, I murmured, \"Why don't we walk down the path like we did in Paris a few years ago? Remember the fun we had?\"\nHand in hand, we walked by the stores. People smiled and nodded. Lots of smiling and nodding, in fact. \"I never realized there were so many friendly people as we have seen this evening, dear,\" I observed.\n\"Probably your new straw hat. Or the fact that you're such a handsome guy,\" she answered. \nWe completed the walking tour past the store windows. After acknowledging many smiles, we found ourselves back at the restaurant, looking at our reflection in the window. It was then that I saw the reason for all the smiles.\nCaught in the fly  of my trousers and hanging down for all to see was a bright red napkin from the restaurant!", "id": "high20958.txt"}
