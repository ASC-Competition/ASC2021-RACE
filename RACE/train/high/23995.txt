The head of the college, whose was Baker, therefore had a special place in the car-park for her own car. There were white lines round it, and it had a notice saying, \"Reserved for Head of College.\" One evening, however, when Miss Baker got back to the college a few minutes before the time by which all students had to be in, she found another car in her parking place. There were two people in it, one of her girl-students and a young man. Miss Baker knew that the young man would have to leave very soon, so she decided to ask him to move his car a bit, so that she could park hers in the proper place for the night before going to bed.\n              As the young man's car was close to the railings, Miss Baker had to drive up beside it on the other side, opened her own window and tapped her horn lightly to draw attention to the fact that she was there. The girl, who had her head on the boy's shoulder, looked around in surprise. She was even more surprised when she heard Miss Baker say, \" Excuse me, but may I change places with you?\"", "id": "high23995.txt"}
