Sure, our parents and grandparents were once teens, but things are so different now. It has never been to tougher  to a teenager.\nIt had never been more important to be in the \"right group\" or to have the \"right brand\" of shoes. And those are the easy things to deal with. We also face problems with family, friends, relationships and school pressures.\nWhen it gets to be too much, I turn to my friends. One friend I could not live without is Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul. Your books have been so inspiring to me and have helped me to deal with and understand the problems I go through.\nFor example, I went through a confusing time with my friends when we got to junior high. I had known these friends since kindergarten, and when we began junior high it seemed like some of them began to change. We started hanging out with different groups, and we slowly grew so far apart that it seemed as if we had never been friends. I felt confused and hurt.\nSometime during this period I read the story Friends Forever in Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul II.I felt so much better after reading it. It was like a weight had been lifted from me when I realized that many friendships went through changes and that we weren't the only friends to experience _ \nPeople change, but that doesn't mean we have to lose the friendships we once shared. My friends and I still spend time together when we can and care about each other a lot. That things are different doesn't mean I have to forget about all the good times we had. I will always keep the memories in a safe place in my heart.\nSincerely,\nPeter", "id": "high3494.txt"}
