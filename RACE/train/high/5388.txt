Students from the poorest backgrounds were most likely to take jobs during term because they could not depend on help from their parents.\nThe report, commissioned   by the Department for Education and Skills, also found a clear relation between fear of debt and employment in non-graduate jobs. Students from poorer backgrounds are known to be more unwilling to be in debt than those from middle class families.\nThe study of 8,600 people who graduated in 1999 was made by Peter Elias, of Warwick University, and Kate Purcell, from Bristol Business School. They found that twice as many first-class degrees were awarded to students who did not work during term compared with those who did. Between 35 and 38 percent who worked during term achieved a lower second, compared with about 28 percent of those who did not.\nProfessor Elias said that the increase in school fees next year to PS3,000 would have to be monitored   carefully for its effect on poorer students. \"Higher education is going to be a harder struggle for those who do not come with all the advantages,\" he said.\nHe suggested that universities could get in touch with employers to provide work experience on good salaries to choose students during holidays, so that they did not have to work during term.", "id": "high5388.txt"}
