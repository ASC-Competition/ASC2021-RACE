Running,walking,playing tennis,and working in your garden are just some of the activities you might try.\n*Take care of yourself\nYou should make every effort to eat well and get enough rest. If you easily get angry and can't sleep well enough, or if you're not eating properly, it will be more likely that you will fall into stressful situations.If stress repeatedly keeps you from sleeping,you should consult a doctor.\n*Make time for yourself\nSchedule time for both work and entertainment.Don't forget,play can be just as important to your overall well-being as work. You need a break from your daily routine to just relax and have fun.Go window-shopping or work on a hobby.Allow yourself at least a half hour each day to do something you enjoy.\n*Make a list of things to do\nStress can result from disorganization and a feeling that \"there's so much to do,and not enough time\".Trying to take care of everything at once can be too much for you and as a result,you may not achieve anything.Instead,make a list of everything you have to do,then do one thing at a time,checking off each task as it is completed.Set out to do the most important task first.", "id": "high3182.txt"}
