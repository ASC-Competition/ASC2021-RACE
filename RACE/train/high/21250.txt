Let me take a picture of you.\" With the words, the young man took a picture and then gave him ten yuan.\nThe beggar is named Xia Haibo, born in Hubei Province. Being 25 years old, he is quite a special beggar in some ways---he doesn't beg on his knees, as other beggars do when begging. Rather, he often stands in a crowded street , either reading a book or thinking over something. As a beggar, he has opened his blog on the Internet and his blog has been clicked more than 500,000 times now. He likes reading---he has read a lot of poems written by Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. He has also read many old Chinese poems. He has kept writing and recently, he planned to publicize his writings.\nAs a beggar, he is so special that many people call him \"the greatest beggar in history\". In 1998,Xia was enrolled  by Tianmen Middle School as the best student in town. However , a year before he took the national college entrance exam ,he was diagnosed  as having rheumatoid arthritis . In order to cure his disease, his father borrowed 60,000 yuan. However, with this money , he didn't recover from the disease. He did not want to become a burden for his family any more. So he went to Wuhan , making a living by begging. \nSo far Haibo has been to Beijing, Guangzhou, Haikou, Fuzhou, Xiamen ,Changsha and Kunming. \"Begging has become a job. I earn about 2,000 yuan every month,\" Xia said.\nHowever, he doesn't plan to go on living like this . \"By July 24 in 2009, when I have been begging for two years, I will stop my begging life. I promise ,\"he said.", "id": "high21250.txt"}
