It is one of the longest migrations   of any mammal.\nAll day, all summer long, in the cold waters near Alaska, gray whales eat and eat.\nInstead of teeth, gray whales have baleen, they are used to getting food from ocean water. They get big mouthfuls of muck   from the ocean floor, then push that muck right back out through their baleen. The mucky water flows through, but tiny animals get trapped in the baleen and  _ .\nWhen the water starts to freeze, the whales begin their long trip south. They swim night and day, without stopping to eat or rest. During the long journey, migrating whales may push their heads out of the water to see where they are.\nTwo months later, the whales reach Mexico.

All winter the babies grow big and strong.\nIn spring first the dads and teenagers leave the lagoons, then the moms with babies. Migrating gray whales swim close to shore, especially moms with babies.
