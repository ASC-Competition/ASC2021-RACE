In fact, the research suggests people may eat less and burn more energy when in a warmer indoor environment.\nThe 13-year study, published in the journal Obesity, involved more than 100,000 adults across England.\nResearchers found reduced weight levels among people living in homes heated to above 23degC(73F), which involved about 15,000 of the households studied.\nDr Daly said: \"As national gas bills continue to rise faster than the rate of inflation, this research suggests the obesity could worsen where heating is turned down below comfortable levels or off for long periods to cut costs.\"\nThis is not just about people who live in well-heated homes being in the financial position to afford more expensive low-calorie foods, exercise classes and sporting activities, and therefore finding it easier to maintain a low BMI level.The study took age, sex, social class and other factors into account.\n\"The comfortable temperature of 20degC -23degC is where we feel comfortable in our clothes and are neither hot nor cold.At temperatures above this, we use more energy and we eat less because our appetite is affected.\"", "id": "high8055.txt"}
