I've been in some of the grandest houses in America, and it's readily apparent that no one lives there. Earlier this year, I had dinner in a mud hut in Ethiopia, where we sat on chairs next to the hostess's bed --- a home that had more warmth than any house I've been in since.\nNow John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, \"This is a book about homes, the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped. The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.\" \nWhether you're sitting in an airport right now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the  s to arrive, you know what he's talking about.\n  We've lived in our townhouse for 21 years.

As Edwards writes, \"Home is family. Home is safety. Home is faith.\"\n  Happy homecoming!", "id": "high24249.txt"}
