Even if you know that you could never afford such an expensive vehicle, you don't forget the name, or the car.\nWhy? You have been affected by product placement.\nCompanies pay a film to place their products in the movie. Product placement took off in the West in the 1980s and is now catching on in China. Two Hunan Satellite TV dramas are recent examples: Ugly Wudi and Let's Go Watch the Meteor Shower (<<>> ).\nShampoo, mobile phones, cars and fitness centers -- anything can be product-placed. Advertisers value the mass appeal of the movies, knowing that a successful film can showcase   their goods to hundreds of thousands of viewers. But when product placement takes over, art can only take a back seat.\nCai Zhiyong has been product-placing for years. The Beijing-based advertiser admits there is a conflict   between art and business. He explains the way one ad works. In If You are the One (<<>> ), the actress Shu Qi plays a flight attendant. The movie contains product placement for airline companies.\nCash-strapped filmmakers often can't pay so much attention to the quality of their work because they need money from advertisers. In the original story for Meteor Shower, the heroine's mother owned an ice cream shop. But no ice cream company wanted to sponsor   the film. For this reason, the story was changed. In the film the man drinks 20 cups of milk tea instead of eating ice cream.\nSo you may see the power of business over the movies, since the script   was perhaps written so that a product could be placed---whether it was ice cream or milk tea.", "id": "high18410.txt"}
