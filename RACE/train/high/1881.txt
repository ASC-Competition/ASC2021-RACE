We have no brothers or sisters. Our family mainly _ our mom,our dad and us. We are growing up in a world differently from our parents'. And we will be the future leaders of China. Some day we have to work hand in hand with each other and make China more and more beautiful. So we must learn to love each other like brothers and sisters.\nIt's hard to think how difficult life would be if we had a sibling(,).We never have to share anything at home. Of course, we might have cousins, but we don't have to live with them! Our parents try to give us the best, and the best doesn't need sharing between two or three children. Do we ever ask ourselves if we are   spoiled?\nA recent study has found that many children don't know how to love others! We don'r know the value of money. We don't know how hard our parents are to support us. We don't want others to regard us as spoiled, do we? Well, why not start now to help our parents at home, share a game with one of our friends or value the opinions of our classmates, even if we don't always agree? In a word, we must learn to love each other!", "id": "high1881.txt"}
