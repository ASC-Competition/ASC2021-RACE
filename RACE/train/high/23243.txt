When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle  .And when there is a square, with someone I every corner.A fifth person is probable going to have to stand in the middle. \n    Why are we so awkward in lifts?\n    \"You don't have enough space,\" says Professor Babette Renneberg, a clinical psychologist at the Free University of Berlin.\"Usually  when we meet other people we  have about an arm's length of distance between us.

You cannot see the elevator engine, you don't know how it's working,\" he says.", "id": "high23243.txt"}
