Here is a very funny joke about how the English and the Scottish save on train fare.\nFive Englishmen boarded a train just behind five Scots, who as a group had only bought one ticket. Just before the conductor came, all the Scots went into the toilet. As the conductor passed the toilet, he knocked and called, \"Tickets, please!' One of the Scots slid a ticket out under the door. It was punched   and pushed back. When it was safe, all the Scots came out and took their seats. The Englishmen were quite impressed by what the Scots had done. On the trip back, the five Englishmen decided to try this themselves and bought only one ticket. They noticed that the Scots had not bought any tickets this time. Anyway again, just before the conductor came, the Scots went into one of the toilets, the Englishmen into the other. Then one of the Scots leaned out, knocked on the Englishmen's toilet and called, \"Tickets, please!\" When the ticket was slid out under the door, he picked it up and quickly closed the door.\nEnglish humor shows the ups and downs of life in Britain. Humour helps us to look at the lighter side of things. So, if you want a good laugh, and want to change your attitude to what would otherwise be a difficult situation, turn to a good English situation comedy and have a good time.", "id": "high16827.txt"}
