He told mum Edith that it would only take five years but after suffering \"a few problems\" it lasted nearly three decades.\nWhen he finally finished, he was left with the head-scratching task of getting the 18-tonne boat out of the back garden. After some time he found a way. A huge crane   was brought in to carefully raise it 40ft in the air over his mother's house and onto a lorry. It was then driven to the seaside and, to Owen's delight, it floated and showed no signs of leaking when lowered into the water.\nNow, 28 years after he first started, Owen is at last preparing to set sail in his beloved boat, Wight Dolphin, with his long-suffering wife Anne. Owen said, \"I am so relieved that it's finished. There were times when I thought it would never end but I'm the sort of person who likes to finish something once I've started.\"\nAt first he persuaded his mum to let him do it in her garden and started taking in sheets of steel and pieces of wood. \"My mother was happy for me to build it at her house but only bacause I told her it would only take five years.\"", "id": "high1687.txt"}
