Wang said the team is working on applications for the rice in different areas, seasons and using different farming techniques. \"It's still far away from mass application, but at least we see the light of hope.\"\nHuman-induced methane, though less abundant than carbon dioxide in the air, is responsible for 20 percent of the global warming effect. Rice paddies are the largest single source of methane linked to human activity. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, China produces 209 million tons of rice in 2014, or 28 percent of the world's total of 734 million.", "id": "high11649.txt"}
