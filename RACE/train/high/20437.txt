It is an occasion which offers all of us an opportunity to remember not only the sick, the aged, and children who have lost their parents, but also friends, workmates,  s and neighbors whose helpfulness and kindness we have enjoyed. \nOver 60 years ago, when a Cleveland man noticed that some people, such as children who lost their parents and patients who lay in bed, too often felt forgotten and  _ , he developed in his mind the idea of showing them that they were remembered. He did this by giving them small gifts. With the help of his friends and neighbors, he gave those people small gifts on a Saturday in October. During the years that followed, other Clevelanders began to take part in the celebration, which came to be called \"Sweetest Day\". Over time, the Sweetest Day idea of spreading cheer to the poor, the sick and children who had lost their parents was broadened to include everyone, and became an occasion for remembering others with a kind act or a small gift. Soon the idea spread to other cities all over the USA.\nSweetest Day is not based on any single group's religious  beliefs or on a family relationship. It is a reminder that a thoughtful word or deed enriches life and gives it meaning. \nBecause for many people remembering takes the form of gift giving, Sweetest Day offers us the opportunity to show others that we care, in a positive way.", "id": "high20437.txt"}
