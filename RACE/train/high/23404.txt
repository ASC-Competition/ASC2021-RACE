He heard me! I also wanted to have enough money to buy a white rose for my mommy, but I didn't dare to ask God for too much.But he gave me enough to buy the doll and a white rose ! \"\n    Then I remembered two days before a local newspaper reported an accident in which a woman and a little girl were badly injured.The little girl died right away, and the mother was left in a critical state.Was this the family of the little boy?\n    Two days after I met the little boy,  I read in the newspaper that the woman had passed away.I couldn't stop myself from going to the funeral.Teary-eyed,  I felt that my life had been changed forever.", "id": "high23404.txt"}
