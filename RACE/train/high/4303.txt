He preferred reading the newspaper or watching football matches on television to talking to his family.\nEverything changed one morning. As soon as I came downstairs to breakfast, I could see that he wasn't his usual reserved   self. \"Can't wait! FIFA World Cup! Big match! Must see!\"    I quickly figured out what all the excitement was about: Dad is a big football fan.\nI had never been interested in football, but Dad's excitement that morning made me more and more curious. I had to find out why this sport was making my normally reserved father act like a five-year-old on his first trip to Disneyland.\nDad decided that we should all eat at a little German restaurant so that we could watch the World Cup while eating. Secretly, I think he was hoping to turn Mum and me into football fans.\nThe match started a few minutes after we entered the restaurant. As I was eating my meal, a loud noise came from the television. Surprised, I looked up at the TV: \"Why is that man jumping up and down?\" Dad patiently explained: \"That's Papa Bouba Diop, my son. It's normal for them to jump up and down after they've scored.\"\nDad explained almost everything to me. His monosyllabic   answers were a thing of the past. I loved the new Dad! I watched the rest of the match, becoming more and more interested. When I told my father that I planned to watch more matches with him, he smiled and gave me a wink  . At long last we had something in common.\nFootball has really helped Dad and me get closer and form a stronger relationship with each other. Who says football is only about 22 men running after a silly ball?", "id": "high4303.txt"}
