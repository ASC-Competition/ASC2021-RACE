They're taking part in a new experiment by Oxford University to see if later classes can improve their exam results.\nGrades 10 students in the UK have to take the nationwide General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams. They have to pass these exams in order to study more advanced courses, and later apply for universities.\nThe Oxford University project means that GCSE students from more than 100 schools across England will start school at 10 am, more than one hour later than the current start time (8:50 am).\nThe project is based on scientific evidence that teenagers are \"out of sync \" with traditional school hours, the Telegraph reported. And what they need is more sleep in the morning.\n\"We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager, in that you seem to be out of sync with the world,\" said professor Colin Epsie, who is leading the study. \"Your parents think it's because you are lazy and opinionated and everything will be OK if you could get to sleep earlier. But science is telling us that teenagers need to sleep more in the mornings.\"\nEveryone follows a natural cycle of sleep and wakefulne ss. Biology has decided that teenagers go to sleep around midnight and don't feel fully awake until 9-10 am, according to scientists. That's two hours later than adults. And their body clocks stay like this until the age of around 21 for males, and 19 for females.\n\"Society provides school for learning, but the brain provides sleep. So we are exploring the possibility that if you delay the schools start time until 10 am, that will improve learning performance,\" said Epsie.\nThe results could be positive, based on previous studies.\nAn early study at the UK's Monkseaton High School in 2009 found that starting an hour later improved grades in core subjects by 19 percent.\nThe Oxford project is expecting to publish the results in 2018. It's time to wait and see whether scientists will give us an excuse to get up late.", "id": "high10727.txt"}
