I called her last week and found out that she wasn't doing well at work, which would make the following year a little more difficult. After hanging up the phone, I decided to offer to help her, but I couldn't think of what to do. However, opportunities come themselves when you're not even looking for.\nA few days later, some friends and I happened to be eating desserts at a restaurant in her city. As we were looking at the menu, I turned to my friends and asked them if they wanted to join in a game. After explaining the idea, they decided to take 15 minutes to _ . We ordered an extra dessert, wrote a note, added a smile card and were off. However, there was one problem: I had no idea where she was.\nTherefore, it was time to rely on the network. I called up a friend and got him to call her to see what she was doing and found out that she was at work.\nWe drove to her work place and one of my friends became the delivery person.He went in to look for my friend, found her, didn't really answer her questions and walked out, saying he's simply a delivery person.\nHe ran out quickly and I bent down as we drove by to make sure she didn't follow him out. Afterwards, all of us had this huge smile on our faces. We felt as if we had just planned a surprise party or something.\nA simple opportunity turned into a moment that many of us can now share.", "id": "high5534.txt"}
