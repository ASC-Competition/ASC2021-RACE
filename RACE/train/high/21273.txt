The figure refers to viewers on any one of the three channels, therefore excluding duplications . This represents almost 40% of the China TV population aged 4 years or above.\nCommenting on CCTV's incredible record achievement which is based on reach of audience, Alistair Richards said, \"It is fitting that we celebratethis amazing achievement at MIPTV. National networks have the power to move nations and CCTV's Spring Festival Gala is the ultimate example. It reaches nearly half a billion people on the biggest holiday of their year.\"\nCCTV Vice President Luo Ming, who accepted the Guinness World Records certificate on behalf of CCTV, said, \"Chinese New Year is a special time for families in China and our Spring Festival Gala has been the traditional TV entertainment highlight for three decades. Although this is a world record achieved by our viewers, it is also a record won by the staff of CCTV, who makes it possible for our television shows to reach homes right across China.\"\nThe new record will be included in the next edition of the world famous Guinness World Records book.", "id": "high21273.txt"}
