Someday, you'll at least be able to send their odors .\nA Paris lab under the direction of David Edwards, Michigan Technological University alumnus, has created the oPhone, which will allow odors to be sent, by Bluetooth and smart phone attachments, to oPhones across the state, country or ocean, where the person who receive it can enjoy American Beauties or any other kinds of rose. It can be sent by email, tweet, or text.\nEdwards says the idea started with student designers in his class at Harvard, where he is a professor.    Normally, he says, there's a clear end in sight, but with their project no one had a clue  who was going to pay for the research or if there was even a market. With the early major buzz  produced -- Wired Magazine, National Public Radio, and the British press -- Edwards is sure the market will come.\n    \"We create odor profiles ,\" says Blake Armstrong, director of business communications at Vapor Communications, an organization operating out of Le Lab in Paris. \"We put that into the oChip that gives away that smell.\"\n    Edwards said that the original four chips that will come with the first oPhones can be combined  into thousands of different odors -- produced for 20 to 30 seconds.\n    In fact, Le Lab is working with Cafe Coutume, the premier coffee shop in Paris, using oPhones to create nice experiences.\n    \"Imagine you are online and want to know what a particular brand of coffee would smell like,\" Edwards says. \"Or, you are in an actual long line waiting to order. You just tap on the oPhone and get the experience.\"\n    And there are other benefits. \"Fragrance houses, of course, culinary, travel, but also healthcare. \"A patient with brain damage had lost memory, and the oPhone can help bring that memory back.\nImprovements are already planned at the end of year--give phone to audience in 2015. \"The oPhone will finally be smaller. \" according to Armstrong.", "id": "high18169.txt"}
