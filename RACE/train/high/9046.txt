They do this very stubbornly, so the females sometimes try to get away -- or prefer to stay unobserved,\" he added.\nIde and his colleagues brought a model of a male butterfly near the females to test their reactions and found that young females that had yet to mate kept their wings open, but those that had already mated closed them.\nNot only can the persistent attentions of unwanted suitors harm the delicate females, fleeing from them -- with the male often in pursuit -- uses up strength and can even shorten their lives, he added.\n\"Closing their wings makes them less visible, helping them avoid communication with their own species. We figured they were trying to avoid harassment by males,\" Ide said.", "id": "high9046.txt"}
