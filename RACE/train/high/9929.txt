He was disabled and quite short. He used to walk together with me and his hand was on my arm for balance. At this time, people would look at us strangely. I was afraid to look at others but he never cares.\nIt was difficult to _ our steps -- his slow, mine impatient. But each time, he always said, \"You set the pace, I'll follow you.\"\nHe never talked about himself as a disabled man and nor did he envy other people's good fortune or health. What he looked for in others was a \"good heart\" -- a good heart in man.\nNow that I am older, I believe that is a right standard to judge people, even though I still don't know exactly what a \"good heart\" is. But I know the times when I don't have it. Unable to take part in many activities, my father still tried to participate in some way. When I played ball, he \"played\" it too. When I joined the Navy, he \"joined\" too. He often introduced me, saying \"This is my son, but it is also me, and I could have done this if things had been different.\"\nHe has been gone many years, but I am so sorry for my unwillingness to walk with him. I never told him how I regretted it. I think of him often when I complain about small affairs and when I don't have a \"good heart \". At such times, I want to put my hand on his arm and say, \"You set the pace, I'll try to follow you. \"", "id": "high9929.txt"}
