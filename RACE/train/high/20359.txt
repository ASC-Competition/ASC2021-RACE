The camera can then detect metallic and nonmetallic objects hidden under clothing on still or moving objects without showing any body detail.\nWhile similar technology is seen at airports around the world, the T5000 is designed to be used in large, open areas. With a range of 25 meters, the T5000 can screen people in public places, thus avoiding bottle-necks at border crossing or security checkpoints. It also means people can be screened without knowing it.\nThe technology develops from British astronomers' work in studying dying stars. Astronomers use T-ray cameras to see through dust and clouds in space. The company sees uses for its camera at other sites where political or business activities take place.\nFor privacy concerns,Thru Vision Chief Executive Clive Beattie said the image produced by the camera did not show detailed parts of the body. \" It's almost a shining light bulb .\" Beattie said. \"You don' t see the detail that people might be concerned about. \" In London' s busy Piccadilly Circus--which is already filled with closed -circuit surveillance  cameras-- reaction to the new technology was mixed. Some said the camera was going too far and violating privacy,but others said they are willing to put safety before privacy concerns. \" There ' s surveillance everywhere anyway.\" said one commuter. \"I don' t think it' s much of a difference. I don' t care that they can see through me because they can see me anyway.\"\nSome experts said the privacy violation of the camera was not worth the benefit. \" What we should consider is how much we want to lose our privacy in order to obtain a sort of national security,\" said David Murakami Wood,director of the Surveillance Studies network,which deals with surveillance and privacy problems. \" In most cases this isn' t real security--it ' s a sense of safety that has very little real effect. \"", "id": "high20359.txt"}
