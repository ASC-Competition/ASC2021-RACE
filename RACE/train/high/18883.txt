Sweet sixteen? What 's so sweet about this birthday? Perhaps because sixteen marks out coming of age, which is the interim period between childhood and adulthood. It is a very brief and unique stage in our lives. A time when we are becoming an adult, yet still haven't lost our childhood innocence. The best of both words.\nActually Sweet Sixteen applies more often to girl's 16th birthday than to boys. At that age, a girl is on the verge of becoming a woman. Picture a flower bud about to bloom, opening its face to the world for the first time. There's a sense of beauty and sweetness to this transition. Our 16th birthday is the first day we can get our driver's license. It is the official step towards becoming an adult. From this day forward, we no longer need our parents to drive us around, take us everywhere. Instead, we just borrow their car. Maybe that's what makes sixteen so sweet to the boys as they eagerly celebrate this newfound autonomy . Now they can drive without adult supervision! Haa, haa!", "id": "high18883.txt"}
