But, at nearly 500 years of age, time is catching up with the Mona Lisa.\nThe health of the famous picture, painted by Leonardo da Vinci in 1505, is getting worse by the year, according to the Louver Museum  where it is housed.\n\"The thin, wooden panel on which the Mona Lisa is painted in oil has changed shape since experts checked it two years ago,\" the museum said. Visitors have noticed changes but repairing the world's most famous painting is not easy. Experts are not sure about the materials the Italian artist used and their current chemical state.\nNearly 6 million people go to see the Mona Lisa every year, many attracted by the mystery of her smile. \"It is very interesting that when you're not looking at her, she seems to be smiling, and then you look at her and she stops,\" said Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University. \"It's because direct vision  is excellent at picking up details, but less suited to looking at shadows. Da Vinci painted the smile in shadows.\"\nHowever, the actual history of the Mona Lisa is just as mysterious as the smile. Da Vinci himself loved it so much that he always carried it with him, until it was eventually sold to France's King Francis I in 1519.\nIn 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louver by a former employee, who took it out of the museum, hidden under his coat. He said he planned to return it to Italy. The painting was sent back to France two years later. During World War II, French hid the painting in small towns to keep it out of the hands of German forces.", "id": "high7345.txt"}
