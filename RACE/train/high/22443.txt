My friends regard me as a goody-goody  . My parents say I am conservative   and modest when it comes to clothes. I don't wear bikinis, and none of my skirts or shorts end above my knees. That is my choice.\nSo why, why did I decide to buy that skirt? My family and I were in Target, and there it was, waiting - a skirt specifically designed not to cover anything. It was light brown and looked like something one of those anime   schoolgirls would wear.\nI checked my purse. The skirt cost $10. I had the money. I could buy it. I imagined walking into school and my pals' jaws   dropping. Guys would ask me out, and I would be happy. I could buy it - no, I should buy it.\nI showed my mother. She was surprised but said it was my decision. My sister looked on jealously.\nI went into the dressing room to try it on. I was so sure that this skirt would change me, somehow make me not what I am but what I wished to be. I slid my jeans off and put it on.\nNow for the decisive moment. I looked in the mirror. There I was - a girl in a Superman T-shirt and sneakers who didn't know how to make friends with others.\nOf course, the skirt had not changed me. It fit me well; that wasn't the problem. It might make me look good in the eyes of today's world.\nBut it simply was not me. I am not a girl who wears cool clothes to fit in. My glasses fogged up as I started to cry.\nI took the thing off and went back into the comfort and safety of modesty.\nMy mom knocked on the door. \"Emily, are you okay?\"\nI wiped away my tears. \"I'm fine.\" I looked in the mirror again and saw a blond skinny girl with thick glasses and a ponytail  . I saw myself.", "id": "high22443.txt"}
