After getting her PhD in biochemistry, she got a job as a researcher at the National\nInstitutes of Health. She got a green card, bought a house in Maryland and worked her way up\nall the time.\nBut then she moved back to China. A law in America stopped the use of public money for\nresearch on human embryos  . This prevented her from doing the kind of work she\nwanted to do. The Chinese government attracts her to return with $75,000 for a new lab.\nShe could use the lab to do her research. \" Maybe because of the culture, the public in China\nare friendlier to the research,\" said Sheng, 55 , whose family remains in the United States.\nAttracted by support and a scientific environment more open to certain types of experiments,\nChina's long-lost scientists are coming back. Besides, China announced that it would double its\nresearch-and-development spending by 2012, to about $69 billion. The returning scientists are\nvery happy about that. In recent years, more than 275,000 have come back.\nMany of these \"sea turtles\" , as they are known, have returned with degrees in science or\nengineering. They are going to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where 81 percent of the\nmembers are returning scientists. Fifty thousand of the returning scientists are starting their own\ncompanies, according to China's Ministry of Education, pushing the development in science.", "id": "high20433.txt"}
