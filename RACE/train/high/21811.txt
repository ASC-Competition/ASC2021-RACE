I have been through very difficult times and I dare say, without my friends, I would not have made it.\nFriendships need lots of energy and patience to maintain them. Not to mention time. When your friend needs you, and when things are not going too well on your side, it is often so easy to _ their requests. It is especially during these times, that you must find the strength to help your friend. And it is during these times that your friendship will be made stronger.\n And you must always be happy for their successes, even when things are not going too well for you. It might be hard to do this, but it s something that you need to learn.
