As he drove by, he saw rows and rows of pigpens and pigs running in fields. Suddenly, his eyes caught something really strange. It looked like a pig with a wooden leg.\nHe drove up into the arm, where he met the farmer. \" Excuse me, \" the traveler said. \" I was just driving by and looking at all your pigs, and I just had to stop and ask about it. Tell me, is there really a pig out there with a wooden leg?\" The farmer smiled. \" Oh, that would be old Caesar you saw. He's the finest pig I've ever had ---and smart! Well, let me tell you a little about that pig.\"\n\" One night a couple of years ago I got to drinking and I guess I had more than I should have. I fell down and knocked over a lamp. That started a fire in the house and old Caesar smelled the smoke. He came in the back door, got the wife and kid out, roused me up and got me out. There is no question about it ---- that night old Caesar saved all our lives. You know that I'm not going to forget it too easily.\"\n\" Why,\" the traveler said, \" this is amazing! I have never heard of a pig like this before! This is fantastic! But tell me, how did he get that wooden leg?\"\nThe farmer laughed and said, \" Well, when you have a pig so smart, you don't want to eat him all at one time!\"", "id": "high4792.txt"}
