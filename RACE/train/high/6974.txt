The museum hopes to bring the worst of art to the widest possible audience and has even published a book of its most \"important\" works. As part of the visit, we'll be shown some truly awful portraits, landscapes and sculptures.\nThe Washington Banana Museum (Auburn, Washington, USA) contains 4,000 objects related to the history of what the museum describes as \"the world's most perfect fruit\". We'll be given a guided tour around the museum, during which we'll learn all sorts of interesting things, such as the fact that bananas were introduced to the USA in 1878 in the same exhibition as Alexander Graham Bell's telephone, and that the banana is now the US' number-one selling fruit.\nThe Hair Museum (Avanos, Turkey) is located in a cave in Cappadocia, in Central Anatolia. It contains 160,000 samples of people's hair. You'll be offered a chance to add your own hair to the collection. Later in the year, the museum curator selects 10 donors to attend a pottery workshop. If you're one of them, you'll be invited to stay in his guest house.\nThe museum du Slip (Brussels, Belgium) is devoted to underwear. The idea behind the museum is that everyone is equal in their underwear. You'll be fascinated to know that it has collected samples from all sorts of people, including artists, politicians and pop stars.\nThe Museum de Carrosses Funebres (Barcelona, Spain) is a museum of funeral hearses  . It takes a look at how local people have been transported to their funerals since the 19th century. During the tour, we'll be provided with a fascinating insight into how the people of Barcelona viewed death. Among the 1,000 or so exhibits, pride of place goes to a \"flap-coffin\", which is a reusable coffin from the 18th century.", "id": "high6974.txt"}
