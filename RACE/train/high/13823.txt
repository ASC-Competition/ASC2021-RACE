A new study suggests that listening to music in the office improves the speed and accuracy of tasks such as data entry, proofreading and problem solving. In an officebased experiment, 88 per cent of participants were found to produce their most accurate work when listening to music.\nThe study also found that 81 per cent completed their work fastest when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to. For instance, if you're doing your tax returns, then classical music is the most effective as it improves maths skills.\nListening to Jessie J or Justin Bieber could also improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proofreading, dance music, such as David Guetta, had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at all. Dance music also had a positive effect on spellchecking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all.\nThe research, undertaken by Brightonbased Mindlab International, suggests that silent offices may be the least productive. The Music Works experiment revealed a positive correlation between music and productivity. Overall, it showed that when listening to music, nine out of ten people performed better, said Dr David Lewis, chairman of Mindlab International.", "id": "high13823.txt"}
