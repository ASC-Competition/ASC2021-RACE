Scottsdale Rd. , Scottsdale \n(480)991-3866 \nThe Buzz is a favorite among underage college students. The club, within a shopping center, has two levels. The downstairs is for everyone, while the upstairs is only for those over 21 years old. Open only on Friday and Saturday. Though it's intended for the youth, it's a wide age range.  Devil House \n829 S. Rural Rd., Tempe \n(480)517-1188 \nThere really isn't a ton to say about the Devil House. It's located right near the crossing of Rural and University, making it an easy walk on foot. It's a simple bar; not so expensive, not so big and not so concerned with anything other than offering beer drinkers and sports fans a homey place to meet up.  Northern Lounge \n5008 W. Northern Ave., Glendale \n(623)937-0940 \nThis bar is all about action and activity. You're welcome, of course, to sit around and drink. You'll come soon on stage for live music. It's a fun, interactive atmosphere and their karaoke nights have been popular on the west side for quite a while.  \nCasey Moore's \n850 S Ash Ave., Tempe \n(480)968-9935 \nCasey Moore's is really everything a college bar should be: comfortable, fun, reasonably-price and close to campus. The outside is pretty big and has plenty of tables, while inside is darker and equally comfortable and a big bar for sitting and chatting.", "id": "high24068.txt"}
