Yet most people have a story about a broken relationship.\nFor Jane Black, a six-year friendship ended when her friend was rude to one of her children. \"After quite a few drinks at a party in my house, she said something rude to my child. I ended the friendship face to face at the party,\" she says. \"I didn't realize what I was doing at the time, I was simply standing up for my child, but in her eyes any challenge was a betrayal.\"\nWhen Angela Thompson noticed a seven-year friendship disappearing, she let it go. \"I didn't know how to deal with the issue. I didn't sit down for a grown-up conversation; I just walked away quietly.\" The decision caused a reaction among Thompson's other friends. \"The other friends in the circle are the worst people when you are trying to break up with a friend,\" she says. \"They don't want you to stop being friends, because it puts them in a difficult position. You get told to just get it over.\"\nThough we have plenty of measures for handling conflict at work or family fight, we still don't have good ways of ending friendships. Do we sit down and properly break up, or just walk away? Psychologist Serena Cauchy has the following advice.\nDon't blame.\nTalk about your needs and feeling rather than talking like a Dutch uncle.\nDo talk about your needs.\nTalk about why the friendship is not working for you--about how your needs aren't being met.\nDon't gossip.\nNegative talk hurts everyone involved and in some cases can make matters worse.\nDon't be so accessible.\nIf there is a common wish to conclude the friendship, then you can remove it.", "id": "high5754.txt"}
