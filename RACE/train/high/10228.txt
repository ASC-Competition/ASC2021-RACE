In this age of visual and aural hyper-stimulation, the medium of radio is making a great comeback.\n\"We're at the beginning of a golden age of audio,\" said US-based podcaster Alex Blumberg in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald. In the last month alone, 15 percent of US adults listened to a radio podcast  . These statistics, released by Edison Research, show the successful evolution of traditional radio broadcasts to the present day's digital podcast format. The term \"podcast\" was invented in 2004, but the trend only started gaining mainstream popularity in recent years. With the sharp increase in consumer demand for smartphones and tablets, podcast sales have jumped.\nThe appeal of the podcast partly lies in its multiplatform delivery and on-demand capabilities  . You can listen during those extra minutes of the day when you're walking to the shops, waiting in a queue or riding the subway. Similar to television shows, podcasts are generally free to download and most offer new content every week.\nDonna Jackson, 22, Sydney University media graduate, listens to podcasts two or three times a week, via iTune. \"I listen while I'm wandering around the house doing something else. It makes completing a boring task much more enjoyable... And it's an easy way of keeping in touch with what's going on in the rest of the world,\" she said, \"I mainly listen to BBC podcasts, but recently I've also been listening to This American Life and Serial. They have a special skill to really draw you in.\"\nUnlike television and music, the audio format has the potential to create a deep impression on readers. Blumberg says this owes to the podcast's ability \"to create close relationship and emotional connection.\" Sydney University undergraduate Hazel Proust, majoring in social work and arts, agrees. \"When you're listening, it feels as if the voice of the podcast's storyteller is talking directly to you. It's comforting.\" said Proust.\nIt seems the age-old tradition of verbal storytelling is very much alive and well.", "id": "high10228.txt"}
