It's true.However,not all the friends are helpful to up your chances of living a long,happy life. The following types of friends are just what you need to keep the doctor away.\nA Loyal Best Friend\nSometimes a loyal best friend is the only thing you need to stay calm. Everyone needs a non-judgmental friend who will support them no matter what.This is the kind of friend who knows all of your deepest and darkest secrets, but still loves you all the same.\nAn Honest Confidant\nThere are certain situations in life where we need to hear the harsh truth. It is really hard for you to face it, but that's what the honest confidant is for. Friends are supposed to be honest with each other. If you find someone who is bravely honest with you (in a constructive way), then hold on to this person! People like that are hard to come by these days.\nA Polar Opposite\nIf you only develop friendships with others who follow the same beliefs, customs, and values as you do, chances are you're kept away from the rest of the world. Try to break out of your comfortable zone and befriend people who hold opposing views. You'll learn to accept people who don't see the world exactly the way you see it. \nA Work Pal\nDo you know that with a full--time job, you spend at least 50%of your waking hours at work? Depressing, isn't it? The more isolated you are at work, the more depressed you get. That's why it makes sense to get a work pal to chat with to help you get through the week. You spend 50%of your waking hours at work, and so does your work pal. You'll find it much easier to complain about work with someone than to eat lunch alone every day.\nWith them in your life, you're bound to live a long and happy life!", "id": "high18115.txt"}
