I'm so glad that day is over. I was so worried all summer that my first day at my new school would be terrible. \nI'm really tired, but my first day at school went well and I feel much better now.\nFirst of all, we had to meet outside the school building. I was very nervous because my primary school only had 300 pupils but in the secondary school there are about 1,300. What a difference! The older pupils are really big. I felt so small waiting there in front of the school.\nThe other problem was that I didn't know anyone. My family moved over the summer holidays, because of Dad's new job. So now I have to try to make some new friends. Standing in front of the school this morning, I wanted to be back at my old school with my old friends.\nThe head teacher came out and told us to go into the school hall. Then he called our names out to tell us which class we were in. My class teacher is called Mrs. Black. She took us to our classroom. It's on the 5th floor and ... guess what? ... We aren't allowed to use the lift. I couldn't believe it.\nWhen we were walking up all the stairs I started talking to another boy who didn't know anyone. He said his family had moved from Hong Kong over the summer. He seemed really nice so we sat together when we got to our classroom, out of breath! He said his English was very poor but I thought it was really good.\nWe spent all morning with Mrs. Black looking at our timetables. Everyone in the school has a different timetable--can you believe it? Half of the school is learning Spanish as a second language and the other half learns French. I'm in the Spanish group, which sounds like fun. I'm worried that I'll forget my timetable and go to the wrong room! How will anyone help me if nobody else has the same timetable as me?\nLunchtime was OK. After lunch we started lessons. I had maths, which was complicated and difficult and then history, where we started to learn about ancient Greece. That looks interesting. I have to do some homework tonight to find out how the ancient Greek people lived.\nSo far so good. I'm quite looking forward to tomorrow, even though I've got science. I hate science!\n                                              Jason", "id": "high17111.txt"}
