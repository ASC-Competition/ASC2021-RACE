When her 4yearold granddaughter Ilean Garcia began saying,\"We're going to die,\"she knew she had to act.Pina,39,first sealed the door,and then told all four children to get on the floor. After calling 911,she told the children to start singing and promised them all treats as soon as they reached safety. \"I said,'OK,we're going to lie down and we're all going to play a game,'\" Pina said. \"We all started singing our ABCs and 123s.I was just trying to make it fun.\" Pina patiently waited,and a few minutes later,Riverside County sheriff's deputies   arrived.
