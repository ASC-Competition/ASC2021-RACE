The hotel laundry ruined your favorite shirt. The taxi driver asked for more money. When you're abroad, sometimes things go wrong. Now you can do something about it! Use these tips when you want to express an effective complaint in English.\nNo matter how unfair the situation is, it's best to express your complaint politely. In English, you'll sound more polite if you use indirect language. Here are some examples:\n\"I'm sorry to bother you...\" Starting a complaint like this puts the listener who may have heard many complaints that day at ease. Use this phrase if the situation isn't that serious. For example, \"I'm sorry to bother you, but I wanted a baked potato, not fried.\"\n\"Can you help me with this?\" Everyone would rather be asked to do something than told! So try expressing your complaint as a request for help: \"Can you help me with this? My shirt came back from the laundry without buttons.\"\n\"I'm afraid there may be a misunderstanding.\" This is a polite way of saying, \"Your information is wrong. Please fix it now.\" You'll most likely use this phrase if you made reservations  for a flight, hotel or restaurant, and when you arrive, it's not what you expected. For example, \"I'm afraid there may be a misunderstanding. I requested a non-smoking room.\"\n\"I understand it's not your fault...\" Often when you make a complaint, you deal with a person who was not directly responsible for the problem. But the problem isn't your fault, either! This phrase is helpful when you need swift action. Tell the person you're dealing with that you understand they're not at fault and then directly state the problem: \"I understand it's not your fault, but the airline promised they would deliver my baggage yesterday.\"\n\"Excuse me, but I understood that...\" Using this phrase lets the person know you're well-informed and doubt they might be trying to take advantage of you. Don't say, \"Hey! You're trying to cheat me!\" Instead, start indirectly by stating what you know to be true: \"I understood that the taxi ride to the airport was only 25 dollars.\" Then give them a chance to do the right thing.", "id": "high18732.txt"}
