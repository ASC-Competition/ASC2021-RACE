Or younger people,many just out of school,with fresh skills and ambitions?\nThe answer is obvious.Older people who would like to retire and would do so if they could afford it should get some help.The right step is to reduce,not increase,the retirement age.As a rough cut,why not make it a law to set a three--year window during which the age for receiving full Social Security benefits would drop to 62----providing a voluntary ,one--time,grab-it-now bonus for leaving work? Let them go home! With a secure pension and medical care,they will be happier.Young people who need work will be happier.And there will also be more jobs.With pension security, older people will consume services until the end of their lives.They will become.each and every one,an employer.\nPassage 2:\nToo many people see longer working lives as a worry rather than an opportunity--and not just because they are going to be chained to their desks.Some worry that there will not be enough jobs to go around.This misunderstanding,known to economists as the\"lump of labour fallacy \",was once used to argue that women should stay at home and  leave all the jobs for breadwinning males.Now lump-of-labourites say that keeping the old  at work would deprive the young of employment.The idea that society can become\nbetter-off by paying more of its citizens to be idle is clearly ridiculous.On that reasoning,if the retirement age came down to 25 we would all be as rich as Bill Gates.", "id": "high9177.txt"}
