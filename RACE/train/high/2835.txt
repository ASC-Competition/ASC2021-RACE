Forests once cleared for farming have started to grow back and black bears have returned to them. But the bears are finding that their forest habitat has changed. Instead of thick forests covering thousands of acres, bears now have neighbors nearby. Roads, homes, schools, and shopping centers have been built at the edge of their forest home. And with humans and bears trying to share the same space, problems arise.\nBlack bears usually prefer to avoid people, but their nose may lead them into trouble. Their normal diet includes nuts, insects, and plants. But given the opportunity, they will gladly help themselves to whatever they can find.\nWith the great sense of smell, the bears can _ a tasty treat 2 or 3 miles away. Food left out in a park or backyard is an invitation to dinner. And whileraiding  a cooler, bird feeder  , trash can, car, or even a home, they can do a lot of damage. When that happens, people get angry. If another solution doesn't immediately appear, they often want the bears killed.\nBear Aware, Bear Wise, and Bear Smart are trying to keep that from happening. They want people to respect bears, not fear them, and are suggesting ways to reduce the chances of bears stopping by for a snack. They're convincing   people that by following some simple steps, it's possible to live peacefully with our wild neighbors.", "id": "high2835.txt"}
