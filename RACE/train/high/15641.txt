They have spent five years turning it into a beautiful home with six floors, winning three architectural prizes.\n\"I love the space, and being private,\" Elizabeth says. \"You feel separated from the world. If I am in the kitchen, which is 25 meters above the ground floor, and the doorbell rings, I don't have to answer it because visitors can't see I am in!\"\nThere are 142 steps to the top so if I go up and down five or six times a day, it's very good exercise! But having to carry heavy things to the top is terrible, so I never buy more than two bags of shopping from the supermarket at a time. Except for that, it's a brilliant place to live.\n\"When we first saw the place, I asked my father's advice about buying it, because we couldn't decide. After paying for it, we were a bit worried because it looked awful. But we really loved it, and knew how we wanted it to look.\"\n\"Living here can be difficult--yesterday I climbed a four-meter ladder to clean the windows. But when you stand on the roof you can see all the way out to the sea on a clear day, and that's a wonderful experience. I am really glad we moved. \"", "id": "high15641.txt"}
