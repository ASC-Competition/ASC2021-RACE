This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise, and as a result,we are ageing unnecessarily soon. \nProfessor Taijiu Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern prefix = st1 /Japanappeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a  ly early age, and how the process of ageing could be slowed down.\nWith a team of partners at Tokyo National University,he set about studying the brain volumes  of a thousand people of different ages and various jobs. \nComputer technology enabled the researchers to get exact measurement of the volume  of the front and side sections of the brain,which relate to intellect and feelings,and determine the human character. The back section of the brain,which controls functions like eating or breathing,does not connect with age. One can continue living without intellectual or feeling abilities. \nContraction of front and side parts - as cells die off - was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not obvious in some sixty and seventy year olds. \nMatsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple cure for the contraction normally connected with age using the brain. \nThe findings show in general conditions that contraction of the brain begins soon among people in the country than in the town. Those are at least at risk,says Matsuzawa,who are lawyers,followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing regular work in government offices are, however,as likely to have shrink   as the farm workers,bus drivers and shop assistants. \nMatsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must flow through a circle properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. \"The best way to keep good blood movement is through using the brain,\"he says. \" Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't depend on pocket calculators. \"", "id": "high22801.txt"}
