He had an accident of some kind almost every week.\n  Alan lived with his mother. His mother was always worried about him. Every day she worried that police would turn up to arrest him. This wasn't a foolish worry because they usually called on the Tong household about once a week to deliver a speeding ticket or to serve him notice to appear in court.\n   Most of his accidents were caused by his carelessness. He drove through red lights. He turned right without signaling. He drove at night without proper lights. He overtook other cars on hills and sharp curve. In short there wasn't a traffic regulation Alan had not broken, and he had had so many accidents that it was a miracle he was still alive. But luckily for Alan, he had never hurt anyone in his accidents or even gone to the hospital.\n   Although Alan wasn't popular with the police, he was very popular with his lawyer. Alan's lawyer, Mr.Tsui, had earned a lot of money from Alan's cases and always rubbed his hands expectantly when he saw Alan coming into his office.\n   One day Alan was working in the garage spraying painting his car when his mother walked in. \"What are you doing?\" his mother asked.\n   \"Painting my car,\" Alan replied.\n   \"I can see that,\" his mother said, \"but why are you painting one side of the car red and the other side blue?\" \"Because every time I have to go to court for a traffic offense, there are always two witnesses   . \"What color1 was the car?\" the prosecutor always asks, and the two witnesses always give the same answer. Well, in the future, one witness will say it was blue. Mr. Tsui will then say to the judge, \"Your honor, the witnesses cannot even agree on the color1 of the car involved in the accident.\" And the judge will have to dismiss the case against me.", "id": "high23379.txt"}
