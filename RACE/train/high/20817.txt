I stared down at my sweat-covered, shaking hands.\n    I looked up again at the audience, realizing that these were real people. They were not just my mum and dad, who would say, \"Good job!\" even if I messed up the entire piece.\n    What if I had the wrong music? What if I played the wrong notes?\n    As it turned out, I was never able to answer these questions because the spotlight   was waiting for me. I grasped my hands tightly together, drying off the sweat.\n    Slowly I walked to the mud-brown piano in the center of the room. It contained 88 demanding keys, which were waiting impatiently to be played. I swallowed the golf-ball-sized lump   in my throat and sat down. Slowly, I opened the music. Next, I rested my still shaking hands on the ivory   keys.\n    As my fingers played across the keys, I was becoming more unsure of my preparation for this moment. But the memory of my years of training came flooding back. I knew that I had practiced this piece so many times that I could play it backwards if requested.\n    Although at one point I accidentally played two keys instead of the intended one, I continued to move my fingers automatically  .\n    My eyes burned holes into (were fixed on) the pages in front of me.\n    There was no way that I was going to lose my concentration. To keep this to myself, I leaned forward and focused carefully on the music.\n    When I came to the end of the page, a warning went off inside my head: DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE WHEN YOU TURN THE PAGE!\n    Needless to say, I obeyed myself with all my heart and mind. And, proud of my \"page-turning\" feat  , I finished the rest of the piece without making a single mistake.\n    After the final note died away, a celebration went into action inside my head. I had finished. I had mastered the impossible.", "id": "high20817.txt"}
