The idea developed by some university students will now be put into practice by Scotland Medical Centre. The research is meaningful, for there are 670, 000 people in Britain who have dementia and by 2021 this is expected to rise to one million.\nDementia can make people confuse day and night or forget basic things such as washing or drinking enough water. The dogs would be trained to help to guide them through the day.\nJoyce Gray from Scotland Medical Centre said, \"People in the early stages of dementia are still able to live a  ly normal life, and dogs help them to maintain routine. For example, people with memory loss will tend to forget to take medicine,but if a dog presents them with a bag with pills in it, there's a greater chance of them taking it.\"\nMs. Gray also said dogs were perfectly suited to remind their owners to eat. \"Dogs have an ability to say 'it's my feeding time', so there would be a note in the cupboard next to the dog's food reminding the dog's owner to eat too.\"\nDogs would also encourage their owners to take them out for walks. \"It gives a reason for the owner to go out into the community,\" Ms. Gray said. \"We did a test with an elderly person walking down the high street on his own. Then we gave him a dog on a lead and he did the exact same walk. That time people would come up to him, chatting, smiling or making eye contact. We hope we'd see this with people with dementia too.\"\nThere is one more advantage of using the pets as companions. Since conversations can be increasingly confusing for people with dementia, dogs can give them a sense of silent support and companionship. Ms. Gray said, \"We have found that people may forget familiar faces but not pets. People light up when they see animals. There is a speechless bond between the dog and its owner.\"", "id": "high19969.txt"}
