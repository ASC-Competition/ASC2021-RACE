You can sign up on the website of, say, Virgin Galactic,the most wellknown of the new space tourism companies, or go to an approved travel agency and put down a large deposit. Soon you will be able to buy travel insurance,just as you can for any other vacation.\nUntil now,space tourism has been limited to the ultrawealthy. Just seven people have paid tens of millions of dollars each for a trip to the International Space Station aboard a Russian rocket.\nBut that could change this year, when Virgin Galactic intends to start offering flights just beyond the space barrier on a rocket ship it has built, featuring five minutes of weightlessness during a twoandahalfhour tour. At $ 200,000 a seat, this will open the final frontier to far more people.\nAt least two other specialty airlines have jumped in as well, taking reservations and deposits for future space flights.Allianz, the big insurer, will introduce an insurance product in 2012, lending space tourism the _ of the regular travel industry.\n\"Just to be able to sell space travel as a regular part of your business, really, just how cool is that?\" said Lynda Turley Garrett, president of Alpine Travel of Saratoga, Calif.,who is one of 58 accredited space agents for Virgin Galactic in the United States.\nIn five years,Ms.Garrett has sold three seats. But she expects that to change once passengers start going up and coming down to tell their friends. \"By 2017,it'll be just like scheduling a flight to L.A.,\" Ms.Garrett predicted.", "id": "high5786.txt"}
