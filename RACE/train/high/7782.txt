Enthusiasm will take you further than any amount of experience.\" How right they were!\n\"Nothing great was ever done without enthusiasm,\" wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is the paste  that helps you hang in there when the things get tough. It is the inner voice that tells you, \"I can do it!\" when others shout, \"No, you can't!\" It took years and years for the early work of Barbara McClintock, a geneticist who won the 1983 Nobel Prize in medicine, to be generally accepted.
