Facebook then attempts to make money by selling their data to advertisers that want to send targeted messages.\nMost Facebook users don't realize this is happening. Even if they know what the company is up to, they still have no idea what they're paying for Facebook because people don't really know what their personal data is worth.\nThe biggest problem, however, is that the company keeps changing the rules. Early on, you keep everything private. That was the great thing about facebook--you could create your own little private network. Last year, the company changed its privacy rules so that many things-- your city, your photo, your friends' names--were set, by default  to be shared with everyone on the Internet.\nAccording to Facebook's vice-president Elliot Schrage, the company is simply making changes to improve its service, and if people don't share information, they have a \"less satisfying experience\".\nSome critics think this is more about Facebook looking to make more money. Its original business model, which involved selling ads and putting them at the side of the page, totally failed.  Who wants to look at ads when they're online connecting with their friends?\nThe privacy issue has already landed Facebook in hot water in Washington. In April. Senator Charles Schumer called on Facebook to change its privacy policy. He also urged the Federal Trade Commission to set guidelines for social-networking sites.\"I think the senator rightly communicated that we had not been clear about what the new products were and how people could choose to use them or not to use them,\" Schrage admits.\nI suspect that whatever Facebook has done so far to invade our privacy, it's only the beginning, which is why I'm considering deactivating my account. Facebook is a handy site, but I'm upset by the idea that my information is in the hands of people I don't know. That's too high a price to pay.", "id": "high3727.txt"}
