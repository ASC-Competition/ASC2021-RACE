These are their top choices.\nKenyon College\nGambier, Ohio, US\nMike Evans, a principal at Norfolk, Va., design firm Hanbury Evans Wright Vlattas + Company, says to be beautiful a campus must have a \"signature campus space as a carrier of the campus brand.\" At Kenyon College, that space is \"Middle Path,\" a 10-foot-wide footpath that serves as the Gothic hilltop campus' central artery. More than just a trail, it's a village green for the tight-knit campus community. Sergei Lobanov-Rostovsky, who teaches 17th-century poetry at Kenyon, says the college, both isolated and pastoral, is \"a small place to think big thoughts.\"\nOxford University\nOxford, England\nTeaching within Oxford's stone walls dates as far back as the 11th century, and the school is considered a paradigm  for all college campuses. With its labyrinth of quads, cloisters, and archways, it evokes elegance and tradition at every turn. \"Its monastic roots and the spectacular quality of its buildings make it an architectural wonderland,\" says David Mayernik, associate professor at Notre Dame's School of Architecture.\nPrinceton University\nPrinceton, N.J., US\nPrinceton's style is pure Collegiate Gothic ; most of it executed in gray stone covered in, yes, ivy. As imposing as these old stone structures are, the campus keeps life on a \"human scale\" by preserving green spaces and walkability.Sinuous footpaths, archways, plazas - all are designed to inspire spontaneous discussion and learning.\nScripps College\nClaremont, Calif., US\nThe total plan of this women's college, founded in the 1920's, has always called for artistic connection between buildings and landscape. Together, architect Gordon Kaufmann, in collaboration with landscape architect Edward Huntsman-Trout, created a distinctively Southern Californian blend of Mission Revival-inspired architecture and landscape, which is lovely, evocative and intact. An expert in deciduous trees, Trout planted rows of liquid amber trees to give the students \"a sense of autumn\" come fall. He also peppered the campus with tulip trees, sycamores, almond and orange trees, as well as rare shrubs.\nStanford University\nPalo Alto, Calif., US\nNew additions like the Science and Engineering Quad manage to gracefully blend modern and technological elements with the timeless, elegant aesthetics of the campus' early California Mission Revival architecture. The campus also scores big points for its dramatic entrance via Palm Drive, its romantic Spanish red-tile roofs and myriad patches of green.\nTsinghua University\nBeijing, China\nForbe's panel of architects says natural setting plays a big part in assessing a campus' beauty. In that regard, this campus is blessed: Founded in 1925, Tsinghua sits on the former site of the Qing Dynasty's royal gardens. Many of Beijing's most notable historical sites, like the Summer Palace, are close by. The campus is peppered with artificial ponds where stone benches and floating lotus blossoms inspire reflection.", "id": "high6412.txt"}
