Here's a guide on e-mail etiquette to help you avoid being annoying.\n       Experts say there are three types of e-mails with different rules--close friends, office and public e-mails.The close friends e- mail\n       You can send your lover, your closest friends and your siblings(brothers and sisters)anything from jokes to\"you gotta see this!\".But bear in mind that not everyone shares your sense of humour and you may expose them to viruses.The office e-mail\n       Don't add to people's workload. Keep e-mails short and to the point.\n       *Make the subject line factual and brief.\n       *Write in clear, concise sentences.\n       *Provide your name and phone number at the end.The Public e-mail\n       Occasionally we have to send an e-mail to a group of people. If possible, write your public e-mails with a who, what, when, where structure. For example:\n       Who:All members of the soccer team\n       What:Team photo\n       When:Saturday, March 25, at noon\n       Where:Playing field 2.\n       Finally, before you hit\"Send\", check the following.\n       *Is the e-mail a\"flame\"? Never send an e-mail in anger. It could stay around forever and haunt your professional and personal life.\n       *Check the \"To\"field.
