It is an invitation-only conference aimed at finding new ways to deal with old problems.\nTraffic jam is a problem that Bruggemann hopes to solve.\"Traffic is really bad in most countries and we thought there must be some way of doing something about it.\"Last week, his team, winning the prize for its\"nunav\"traffic management system, received a Microsoft Imagine Cup Grant of $100,000.\"Everyone that's using our system sends his present position as well as the destination to our servers every 30 seconds. And with that information our central system can reroute all of the cars in a way that everyone gets his individual best possible route.\"\nBruggemann says early research with the system has been promising.\"We found out that it could be possible to save up to 20 percent of the fuel consumption. Even more interesting, it can save up to 50 percent of the time you spend in traffic so you could get to your destination twice as fast.\"\nTeam Cypher256 from Uganda also was invited to the Social Innovation Summit. They developed a device ,called WinSenga, aimed at improving health care for pregnant women in Africa. It measures the early baby's heart sounds to help test the heart rate, age and position of the baby in the mother. The device is similar in operation to an ultrasound test, but is far less costly and very practical in Africa.\nThis is the third year for the Social Innovation Summit. The event is held twice a year, once in New York and once in California. The first one in 2012 was held in May.  The United Nations'Office for Partnerships helped to organize the event.", "id": "high23113.txt"}
