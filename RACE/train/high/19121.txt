We make sure they are unforgettable!\nShadow Ridge Summer Camps offer so many exciting things for campers to do. Unlike other camp programs that include horses as a small part of their program, at Shadow Ridge horses are the program! We are 100% horse from stable   management, nature walks, and track rides to bedroom furnishings.\nHorses help us achieve many of our aims. Girls can learn to develop responsibility, self-confidence and personal connections in their lives while having fun. Using horses as a wonderful tool for education, our camps offer an interesting place for growth and learning.\nImagine each girl having her own horse to spend time with and a best friend to love and take care of. Each camper is responsible for a horse for a week. Our riding program provides a lot of riding and lesson time. Campers will learn how to take care of the horse and the track  , as well as how to ride. Days are filled with horse-related activities to strengthen the connection between each girl and horse, as the girls learn to work safely around the horses.\nAt Shadow Ridge we try to create a loving, caring family atmosphere for our campers. We have \"The Bunkhouse\" (4 girls), \"the Wrangle Roost\" (4 girls), and \"The Hideout\" (2 girls) in our comfortable 177-year-old farm house. All meals are home cooked, offering delicious and healthy food for the hungry rider.\nOur excellent activities create personalized memories of your child's vacation. Each child will receive a camp T-shirt and a photo album (usually 300 - 500 pictures) of their stay at camp.\nOur camps are offered during June, July and August 2007, for small groups of girls aged 13 -16 years, not only from Canada but also other parts of the world.\nWe will send you full program description at your request.", "id": "high19121.txt"}
