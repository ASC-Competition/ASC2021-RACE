The word caught the attention of the dictionary's editing team after BBC's recent program on influential Chinese words. \"If its influence continues, it is very likely to appear on our updated list of words,\" said Julie Kleeman, project manager with the editing team.\nIn Chinese tu means uncouth   and hao means rich. It has traditionally been referred to rich people who _ in China's countryside. The word became more popular in September with the launch of Apple's new gold-colored iPhone, which is loved by China's rich people. The color became known as \"tuhao gold.\" The word is now also used by the online community to refer to people who have the cash but lack the class to go with it. Kleeman also mentioned two other Chinese words -- dama and hukou -- which may also make it into the dictionary.\nPeople can have an intuitive   grasp of the meanings if they see pinyin, Kleeman said, adding that people avoid using an English word to keep the original meaning.\n\"We have nearly 120 Chinese-linked words now in Oxford English Dictionary,\" she said. Some of them are: Guanxi, which means \"connection\"; Taikonaut, a mix of taikong, meaning outer space, and astronaut.\nThe new words will be first uploaded on the official website before the dictionaries arrive. The online version is also renewed every three months. \"It at least broke our old rules. It used to take 10 years to include a new word but now we keep the pace with the time,\" according to a statement from ex-chief-editor John Simpson.", "id": "high6314.txt"}
