My next class, Spanish, scared me. As the second bell rang in the hallway, I ran to the door of the classroom.  \nAt the door, a hand reached out and shook mine firmly. I looked up. A man smiled and introduced himself as Profe, which means teacher or professor in Spanish. Right away, his warm smile and welcoming words eased my fears. I enjoyed his classes a great deal because I learned more than just Spanish.    \nI admit I only speak a little Spanish. But I try to live out the life lessons I learned from Profe every day. \n\"Everyone is worth your time. \" \nProfe stood outside his classroom door every day before and after class. During lunch,  his room was always filled with students. He would stay after school to listen to and chat with students. He taught me that every person is special.  \n\"Don't fear the difficulties.\" \nOne time, I ran into his class crying. My friends had  _ me, and I wasn't even sure why they always left me alone. Profe told me, \"Linda, life gives you ashes . But learning its lessons will turn those ashes to jewels. The hard stuff will help you become a better person.\" I learned to look at my troubles differently because I know I'll grow in difficult times.  \nA year ago. I visited my old high school hoping to see Profe. But he had retired. My high school helped me contact him. Now we stay in touch through e-mail. The author William Arthur Ward wrote: \"The ordinary teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher shows.  The great teacher inspires. \" Thank you, Profe, for inspiring me.", "id": "high23375.txt"}
