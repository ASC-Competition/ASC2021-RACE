But it really doesn't have to be that way,\" said Anaclerio. Last summer, Anaclerio and her friend Jill Carlisle, a Northbrook mother of a 2-year -old, founded a home party-planning business called \"A Party in a Basket.\" Their goal is to help parents and children share in the fun part of party planning, like choosing the subject or making a cake, while they take care of everything.\nDrawing on their experiences as mothers, they have created 10 ready-to-use, home party packages. Everything a family needs to plan a party, except the cake and ice cream, is delivered to the home in a large basket.\n\"Our parties are aimed for children 2 to 10, \" Anaclerio said, \"and they're very interactive   and creative in that they build a sense of drama based on a subject. For example, at the Soda Shoppe party the guests become waiters and waitresses and build wonderful ice cream creations.\"\nThe standard $ 200 package for eight children includes a basket filled with invitations, gifts, games and prizes, paper goods, a party planner and the like.
