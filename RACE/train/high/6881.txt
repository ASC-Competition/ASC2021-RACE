Rhotic essentially means an accent where the letter \"r\" is pronounced strongly after a vowel  . Rhotic accents are strong in both the US and Scotland, but seem to have disappeared from British English and its _ , such as Australian English and New Zealand English.\nThe major American accent -- the typical accent of the mid-western US -- is rhotic, and British English is, as a rule, non-rhotic. Specifically, US speakers pronounce every \"r\", wherever they appear in a word. Most British speakers (and you will note that there are some British Isle accents that are strongly rhotic, like US) do not pronounce every \"r\". Americans stress the \"r\" at the end of words such as \"teacher\" or \"neighbour\", but in many non-rhotic British accents it is more of a \"schwa\" (an unstressed sound) so it comes out as, \"teacha\" (unstressed) or \"neighba\".\nThis main difference also differs across the country of origin. For example, the US has a clear difference in the accents between people of the north and south, not to mention less clear differences across the states. Similarly, British people have a different accent according to their locality. The \"cockney  \" accent is greatly different to the middle and upper class accents.\nAnother common difference appears to be that Americans pronounce words such as \"herbal\" without the \"h\". Syllables   may be stressed differently, too. \"Oregano\" in the US tends to be pronounced \"o-reg-a-no\" while in British English it is more likely to be \"o-reg-AH-no\".", "id": "high6881.txt"}
