But since culture develops differently in many places, some festivals are, to us, very strange. Let's take a look at some unique festivals around the world.\nCheese Rolling Festival (England)\nThe festival started in the 15thcentury in May. When a round cheese is rolled, competitors run down the hill and try to catch it before it reaches the bottom. As the cheese can reach speeds of up to 112 km/h, it's rare that someone catches the cheese. First to the bottom wins the cheese. But running down a very steep  hill behind a cheese can be dangerous. Eight people were injured in 1992.\nRoswell UFO festival (New Mexico, US)\nThe Roswell UFO festival celebrates the anniversary  of the \"Roswell Incident\", when a UFO was said to have crashed  nearby. Every year in July, experts, authors, researches and lecturers come to discuss the incident. The celebration also includes an alien parade, an alien costume contest, and an alien hot air balloon ride.\nHemingway Days (Florida, US)\nThis festival has normal stuff (,) like short-story readings and exhibits about the author. But the highlight   of the festival is definitely   the Hemingway look alike contest.\nImagine walking into a bar and being greeted by 20 middle-aged men who all look alike: stocky with thick white beards. The festival takes place in mid-July every year.", "id": "high3387.txt"}
