But as everything he needed was given to him without asking, Jonny became a _ . He was so spoiled by everyone that he couldn't stand any hardship.\nOne day Johnny heard a mother saying to her son \"Come on, my boy, get up and stop crying. You are behaving like Johnny Jones.\" That made Johnny feel very ashamed. But he was sure that he would prefer to be known as a good boy rather than a fool. Worried, he spoke to his father about all this, though he was afraid that maybe he would be laughed at for having such worries. His father, far from laughing at Johnny, told him that a teacher had taught him a secret trick to turn him into the toughest boy off all. \"Eat a candy less, study a minute more, and count to five before crying.\" Johnny asked, \"Just that? \" \"Yes, just that,\" said his father, \"It's very simple, but I warn you that it won't be easy.\"\nJohnny was happy like a bird, ready to follow the advice. He went to see his mother, and she noticed how happy he was when she offered him candies. \"One candy less\", thought Johnny, so he only took one. That afternoon he had another chance to put it into practice by studying one minute more. The result was that he missed the first minute of his favorite program! But having achieved this gave him a great feeling of satisfaction. The same happened when he ran up against the corner of the kitchen table. He only managed to count to four before crying, but that was left deeply in his mother's memory.\nOver the following days Johnny kept using the motto in his life as his father told him. And the more he put this into practice ,the easier it got. Before long he realized that he could also do things that would seem impossible before.", "id": "high1979.txt"}
