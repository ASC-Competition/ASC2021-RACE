He was also a millionaire. He had visited every country in the world. He had crossed Antarctica, flown across the Atlantic by balloon, and climbed Mount Everest. Last year he decided to walk across Death Valley, the hottest place on Earth. He walked for days over the hot desert sand. One night he found the camp where he had been the night before. Gray had walked in a circle. He was lost.\n    Two days later he had drunk all his water. He couldn't walk. He crawled to the top of a sand dune , and there he saw a man. The man was wearing smart, clean trousers, a white shirt and a tie. Gray crawled over to him.\n    \"Water...water...\"he said.\n    \"I'm terribly sorry, old boy,\"replied the man,\"but I haven't got any water with me.\"\n    \"Help me!\"shouted Gray,\"I'm a rich man...a millionaire...I'll give you anything.\"\n    \"That's very nice of you, old boy,\"said the man.\"Look, I can't give you any water, but would you like to buy my tie?\"\n    \"A tie? Of course not!\" screamed Gray, and crawled away. He  _ led slowly up the next sand dune. His mouth was full of sand. His lips were cracked and dry. He couldn't breathe. He reached the top of the dune and there he saw a huge good hotel. Girls were swimming in the large swimming pool. Beautiful fountains were all around the hotel.\n    \"Is it a mirage ?\"he thought.\"Am I dying?\"He stood up and staggered down the dune.\n    A waiter in a shining white uniform came out of the door.\n    \"Water...water...a bath! Food!\" screamed Gray.\n    \"I'm sorry, but you can't come into his hotel,\"said the waiter.\n    \"Why not? I've got plenty of money...I'm a millionaire.\"\n    \"Ah,\"replied the waiter,\"but you aren't wearing a tie!\"", "id": "high20756.txt"}
