The typed notes read, \"Don't leave it. You might be the one who steps in it the next time you walk this way.\"\nWhile welcoming the purpose of the message, local government officers have _ Pooperman for producing even more rubbish.\nThey say they would prefer it if people told them when there was a problem rather than adding to the rubbish problem. The city of Lincoln government's environmental officer, Tony Garner, said, \"The public can help instead by observing dog owners to make sure they clean up after their pets, perhaps asking them to remove the waste if they try to leave it.\"\n\"If this doesn't work we can take action -- people can tell us who the owner is, give us a description of the owner and the dog, or simply tell us when and where they allow their dog to produce the waste.\"\n\"We can then focus our patrols  and take action against irresponsible owners.\"\nSue Grace, a dog owner from Birchwood, Lincs, said, \"I always clean up after my dog. It's very irresponsible if you don't.\"\n\"There's nothing worse than stepping in dog waste or dragging your long lead through it, but I don't know that putting notes on it is the answer.\"\n\"It's good that the local government is fighting against dog waste, though it might take one or two prosecutions  to make any difference.\"", "id": "high9942.txt"}
