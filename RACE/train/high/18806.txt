For many kids growing up today,there are fewer and fewer opportunities to practice risk taking.Risk taking is an important skill every kid needs to learn,how to do something that they are a little seared of doing because they haven't done it before.Part of the reason for \"Overprotection\" is certainly the parental fear. This is certainly evident in terms of the physical environment.\n    I claim that much of the parental concern isn't driven by.fear of injury--it's more about concern with success.\n    \"Play\" may be in fact less dangerous than our structured sports--yet we focus more on the risk because we don't see the benefit.And this broader concern with success is not limited to the playground or sports field.\"Overprotection\" certainly happens in the social and academic fields as well,as phrases like \"helicopter parent\" have become mainstream.There is plenty of social and academic risk taking that can also be prevented because of the perception of risk.", "id": "high18806.txt"}
