The group says it is the first program in the country to use dogs to help develop literacy in children, with the introduction of Reading Education Assistance Dogs (READ).\nThe Salt Lake City Public Library is sold on the idea. \"Literacy specialists admit that children who read below the level of their fellow pupils are often afraid of reading aloud in a group, often have lower self-respect, and regard reading as a headache,\" said Lisa Myron, manager of the children's department.\nLast November the two groups started \"Dog Day Afternoon\" in the children's department of the main library. About 25 children attended each of the four Saturday-afternoon classes, reading for half an hour. Those who attended three of the four classes received a \"pawgraphed\" book at the last class.\nThe program was so successful that the library plans to repeat it in April, according to Dana Thumpowsky, public relations manager.", "id": "high2560.txt"}
