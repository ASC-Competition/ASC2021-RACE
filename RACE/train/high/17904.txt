The area' s city councilwoman  was leading a discussion about how the quality of life was decreasing. The neighborhood faced many problems.\n    Mark looked at the charts taped to the walls. There are charts for parking problems, crime, and for problems in vacant buildings. People were supposed to suggest solutions to the councilwoman.\nIt was too much for Mark. \"The problems are too big,\" he thought. He turned to the man next to him and said, \"I think this is a waste of my time. Nothing I could do would make a difference here.\"\n    Mark thought some more on his way to the bus stop. \"People should just take care of themselves, \"he decided. \"That' s enough to do. I can' t take on all the problems of the world.\"\n    As he neared the bus stop, Mark saw a woman carrying a grocery bag and a baby. She was trying to unlock her car, but she didn't have a free hand. As Mark got closer, her other child, a little boy, suddenly _ into the street.

Then he picked up the groceries while the woman smiled in relief. \"Thanks! \"she said. \"You've got great timing!\"\n    \"Just being neighborly,\" Mark said. As he rode home, he glanced at the walls of the bus.  On one of them was \"Small acts of kindness add up.  \"Mark smiled and thought, \"Maybe that's a good place to start.\"", "id": "high17904.txt"}
