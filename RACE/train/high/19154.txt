They tell me that all their friends have it already and they can't live without it. Our house is full of Game Boys, Play Station CDs and a million other \"latest things\".\nBut, the one \"latest things\" we have refused to buy is a mobile phone. Our twelve-year-old son wants one, and we've said \"no\". He says he'll only use it for texting and he really needs it for emergencies.\nWe don't want him to have a mobile phone, because it may be bad for children's health. Unfortunately, when I say, \"As your father, I don't want you to have a mobile phone, because you might get a brain tumour ,\" he tells me that he doesn't mind.\n Why do twelve-year-old boys only want things that are bad for them? We've already told him that he can't listen to rap music--the words are disgusting . And I've said no to beer with his meals.

He shows me a website full of them and tells me it only fires plastic pellets  . Finally, I say yes. I can't believe I've said no to phones and yes to guns.\nIn October our son becomes a teenager, and I pray that research will find that mobile phones are safe...even better, that young people may become less moody--and more interested in personal hygiene .\nUntil  _ , I'm saying no.", "id": "high19154.txt"}
