Last year, I came across an article in a magazine describing living statues in the streets of some Australian cities. The article was vividly written, except that there was not even a single picture; one could only imagine what a scene it would have been! All the harder, then, to believe that I ran into the \"wonder\" in prefix = st1 /Barcelonathis year. The performers - the living statues - were street artists at Las Ramblas.\nLas Ramblas is the most famous street in Barcelona. Especially in summer, thousands of tourists go to the seaside by passing through this street, making it a center of shops and bazaars. Not only can you find tourists there, but also thieves, cheats, cops...among whom the living statue artists are the most special group.\nThey were covered with greasepaint in different color1s, wearing season - disproportional  clothes, standing on a pedestal for several hours without making even a single move. Are they real or _ , the guests were wondering...and then suddenly the statues came to life, just for a few seconds to shift positions. But the movement of the statues seemed like someone just had breathed life into them. They really do look like statues, and that's how they got their name.\nUsually there is a jar or a hat in front of them. They would change to another pose whenever some tourist puts a coin in the hat. You may take photos after giving a Euro, or even less, but be careful not to touch the statues, unless you want yourself to be covered in paint. It's a really special experience, don't you think?", "id": "high22941.txt"}
