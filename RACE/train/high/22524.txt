Most of their work is done with the students. But the staff sees a lot of parents, too. \n\"Parent meetings form a clear monthly pattern,\" says Mildred Foreman, Guidance Director. \"This pattern stays much the same from year to year. The busy months are October, March and May.\" \nSeptember starts rather slowly. Few parents come in. Most of them want to discuss the schedules. October brings many behaviour problems. Some parents are called in. Others come by themselves. Things quiet down in November. December is a quiet month. \"It's the holiday,\" Ms. Foreman says. \"People want to come in, I know, but they decide to wait until after New Year's Day.\" \nReport cards go home just before Christmas holidays. Bad marks bring parents in as school reopens. This happens again in March, another report card month. May is always the year's busiest month. That's when parents realize that their children might be held back  . They come in to see if anything can be done before things are decided in June.", "id": "high22524.txt"}
