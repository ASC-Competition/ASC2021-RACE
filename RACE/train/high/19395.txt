The second patient was in Orlando, Florida while the first reported case was in Indiana.\nTom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the disease has mainly been transmitted  by close personal contact, such as directly caring for a very ill person.\nThe virus is formally called MERS-CoV because it's part of the corona virus  family that includes the common cold and severe SARS. SARS was  ly easy to stop a decade ago, because it was being transmitted by caged animals in Chinese markets. MERS-CoV was first identified in people in 2012, but has been spreading rapidly since March, 2015. The vast majority of those cases occurred in Saudi Arabia.\nThe patient in Orlando felt ill on the first flight but not ill enough to notify a doctor. Early on May 9, he apparently became concerned that he was still feeling ill, and he went to the emergency room at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. He identified himself as recently having been in Saudi Arabia, so he was quickly isolated to avoid infecting  other patients.\nWayne Marasco, an expert at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, said his biggest concern about MERS-CoV is how little we know about it. It's still not clear, in some instances, where the virus comes from, how it is transmitted or who is most subject.", "id": "high19395.txt"}
