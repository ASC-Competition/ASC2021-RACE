The first way is to get _ on the specific things you want. There is a limitation to this type of approach (,) though. If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life.\nThe other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless  ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits.\nThe first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost $1045, which included airfare and even the $130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier   covered Mount Chimborazo.\nI cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost $158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only $256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and  could only take carry-on luggage.\nNever did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana.\nBeing an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it. If the guide that took me up Chimborazo hadn't dropped his price from $200 to $130, I would have spent $2 for a bus and gone hiking on EI Altar, another great Andean mountain. That would have left me with enough money for several other minor adventures.", "id": "high639.txt"}
