Failure can also create fame,just like William Hung,21,a native of Hong Kong.\nHung recently has made an agreement with USbased entertainment firms Koch Records and Fuse Music Network. They'll publish a record,titled TheTrueIdolon April 6.\nThe idol is a civil engineering student at the University of California at Berkeley. He did a version of Ricky Martin's SheBangson the television showAmericanIdol3,on January 27.The Fox TV singing contest searches for pop stars among ordinary people. In the case of Hung,however,his act was so bad that the judges cut him off in midact.\nHung's response?\"I already did my best,so I have no regrets at all.\" That's good,because any common person would have found plenty to regret:the offkey singing,the blue Hawaiian shirt worn with pants pulled up too high,the terrible dancing and the hips jerking   to a beat that did not belong to the song,maybe not even to this planet.

A lot were saying I was very courageous and that I was great on the show,but some didn't have much respect for me and some were kind of mean.\"\nNow he says he's not so sure whether to distance himself from the glamour   or to accept it.Returning to normal hasn't been easy.", "id": "high22100.txt"}
