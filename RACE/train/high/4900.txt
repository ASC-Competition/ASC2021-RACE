This is a lesson that some large American corporations have learned the hard way.\nWhat's in the name?\nSometimes the problem is the name. When General Motors introduced its Chevy Nova into Latin America, it overlooked the fact that Nova in Spanish means \"It doesn't go\". Sure enough, the Chevy Nova never went anywhere in Latin America.\nTranslation problems\nSometimes it is the slogan that doesn't work. No company knows this better than Pepsi-Cola, with its \"Come alive with Pepsi!\" campaign. The campaign was so successful in the United States , Pepsi translated its slogan literally for its international campaign. As it turned out , the translations weren't quite right. Pepsi was begging Germans to \"Come out of the grave \" and telling the Chinese that \"Pepsi brings your ancestors  back from the grave.\"\nA picture's worth a thousand words\nOther times, the problem involves packaging . A picture of a smiling baby has helped sell countless jars of Gerber baby food. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same packaging as in the US, with the smiling baby on the label. Later they learned that in African countries, the picture on the jar shows what the jar has in it, for many people there can't read.\nTwist of fate\nEven the culture and religious factors and pure coincidence can be involved. Thorn McAn shoes have a Thorn McAn \"signature\" inside. To people in Bangladesh, which is a Muslim country, this signature looked like Arabic script for the word Allah. In that country, feet are considered unclean, and Muslims felt the company was offending God's name by having people walk on it.", "id": "high4900.txt"}
