The new Spider-Man movie is about to start and you've got the snacks: soda and popcorn. Food is part of what makes the movies fun.\nJust as the lights go out, you catch a slight smell of ... tuna fish?! You turn your head, searching for the source. Then you spot him: A couple rows back, some guy is enjoying a tuna fish sandwich. How'd he get that in here? You wonder.

Why pay $ 5 for a bag of M&Ms when you can get them for a dollar at the corner store?\nEarlier this year, a Michigan man decided to fight for his right to snack. Joshua Thompson is using his local theater after it banned outside food. He argues the ban breaks a Michigan law that prevents businesses from charging extremely high prices. However, most legal experts believe Thompson has little chance of winning his case, though he does have a point: 85 cents out of a dollar of treats a movie theater sells is pure profit .\nThe truth is that movie theaters are more in the snack business than the movie business.

Breaking those rules can have unpleasant consequences too. Some theaters will kick you out if they catch you. Even without the threat of punishment, we should follow rules all the time------out of respect.\nHere's a good idea: Eat before the movie.", "id": "high7116.txt"}
