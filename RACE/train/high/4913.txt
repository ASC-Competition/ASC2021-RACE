It seems to be that, within reason, the more sleep the better for boys,\" Skidmore said in a statement Thursday.\n\"It was unexpected that we did not find the same result in girls, who may actually be more aware of their diet and more in tune with a healthier lifestyle.\"\nThe researchers ruled out the effects of food choice and number of screens, such as televisions, games and consoles, which the teenagers had in their bedrooms.", "id": "high4913.txt"}
