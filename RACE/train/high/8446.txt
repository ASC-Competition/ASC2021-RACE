Ricochet's owner Judy Fridono said, \"I was working with her at balance and coordination  . Her balance is so good that she can help to stabilize the board for the kids. And it makes them feel good to know that Ricochet is there with them, keeping them company.\"\nAfter becoming an expert, two-year-old Ricochet helps the disabled children build up the confidence to get on the board themselves. Dressed in a yellow jacket, Ricochet helps to counter-balance the board and acts as a reassuring presence.\nMs. Fridono knows what an impact her beloved dog can have. She herself was severely disabled since her teens. Having Ricochet around lifts her spirits, and inspires her to conquer her pain to get on the board. \"Ricochet has taught me to focus on what I can do, rather than what I can't,\" she said.\nOne of those who have benefited from Ricochet's skills is six-year-old Ian McFarland. In 2008 a car crash left him with brain damage. Although he had loved surfing before the accident, he was too nervous to go back into the water. His fear turned to excitement, when he was told he could try a tandem   surf session with Ricochet. Their session was a success and by the end of it, Ian was smiling from ear to ear. As well as helping with treatments, Ricochet also raised PS5,000 to help continue Ian's recovery.\nOver the last 10 months, Ricochet's excellent performances on the sea have raised more than PS30,000 for a number of charity causes.", "id": "high8446.txt"}
