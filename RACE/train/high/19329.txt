The comparison doesn't sit well with the British student, who's currently in Year 8 at Colchester County high school, a selective girl's grammar school in Essex, England.\n\"I don't think I can be compared to such great intellectuals such as Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. They've achieved so much. I don't think it's right,\" Lydia told CNN.\nLydia sat the test in her summer holidays, after raising the idea with her parents and pestering  them for the best part of a year. It turns out the test wasn't that hard after all.\n\"I was really nervous before the test and I thought it was going to be really hard. But as I started the test, I thought it was a bit easier than I thought it was going to be,\" she said.\nLydia's  not quite sure what she wants to do when she leaves school, although she's  leaning toward something \"based around Maths, because it's one of my favorite subjects. \" \"All I,m going to do is work as hard as I can, and see where that gets me,\" she said.\nTo explain Lydia's  mark's  level, the top adult score in the Cattell III B test, which primarily tests verbal  reasoning, is 161. A top 2% score  which allows entry to Mensa, the club for those with high IQs  would be 148 or over. Lydia scored 162, placing her in the top 1% of the population.", "id": "high19329.txt"}
