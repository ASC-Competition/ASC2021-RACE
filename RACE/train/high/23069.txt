The women who consumed a lot of baked fish like salmon received stronger benefits than those who consumed mostly tuna, grouper or white fish. The consumption of baked fish also appeared to provide protection against high blood pressure cardiovascular disease . It also found that those women who consumed more baked fish tended to have a lower body mass index , exercise more and consume more fruits and vegetables in comparison to those who consumed fried fish.\n    Researchers note that past research has discovered that the fatty acids in fish probably decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease by decreasing inflammation  and improving blood pressure along with heart and blood vessel functioning. This study does show the link between fish consumption and heart failure risk but it was not designed to show cause and effect.\n    This study also showed that just by consuming one serving of fried fish a week was linked to a 49% greater risk of heart failure. It also found that the consumption of fried fish was linked to a lower fiber intake and a higher calorie intake. Dr Lloyd-Jones, associate professor with North-western's Feinberg School of Medicine, states frequent consumption of baked fish appears to be part of a suitable pattern that is greatly beneficial for numerous things. This advocates that fish is a very good source of lean protein that we should be increasing as a part of our diet.\nRecommendations from the American Heart Association suggest consuming a minimum of two 3.5 ounce servings of fish especially fatty each week.", "id": "high23069.txt"}
