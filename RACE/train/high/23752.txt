In most cultures, names matter a great deal.\nAmericans choose names for their children with care. Parents usually think about the impression a name gives, not its meaning. Most Americans would consider a \"Jennifer\" more attractive than a \"Bertha\", for example. The last name, or, surname, must also be considered when choosing a first and middle name. A name like Lester Chester Hester would sound poetic, but odd. Parents would avoid names that remind them of people they don't like. On the other hand, people might name their children after a respected elderly   or even a famous person. The popularity of certain names can change with each new generation. Names that were once common, like Fanny or Elmer, sound old-fashioned today. But other names---like John and David, Mary and Sarah---have stood the test of time and continue to be favorites.\nPeople in America don't always call their friends and  s by their given names. Instead, they often use nicknames. Sometimes nicknames are short forms of a longer name. For instance, a girl named Elizabeth may be called Lisa, Beth or Betsy. As children grow up, they may decide for themselves which nickname they wish to be called. Some people just go by the initials of their first and middle names, like B.J. or R.C. And of course, people may call their children or their sweethearts other special nicknames. Often they have a \"sweet\" flavor, like Honey or Sugar.\nWhat's in a name? A word of significance. So if you're choosing an English name for yourself, take care to choose a good one. A made-up name could sound strange to native English speakers. And a translation of your Chinese name may not make an appropriate name, either. But a good name can leave a positive and lasting impression. As an American politician once said, \"In real life, unlike in Shakespeare, the sweetness of the rose depends upon the name it bears.\"", "id": "high23752.txt"}
