Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\" \nFive of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list.\nDams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture. Fish populations, the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide, are also being threatened.\nThe report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people's livelihoods.\n\"Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,\" Pittock adds. \"Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary.\"\nIn addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given the resources to make them work, says WWF. \n\"The freshwater crisis is bigger than the ten rivers listed in this report but it mirrors the extent to which unabated development is  _ nature's ability to meet our growing demands,\" says Pittock. \"We must change our mindset now or pay the price in the not so distant future.\"(373)", "id": "high17145.txt"}
