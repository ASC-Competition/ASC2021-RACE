One evening he could not finish an end for a story. He sat in his study , but he had no ideas. So he decided to go to the cinema.\nWhen he came back, he found that he had had a visitor. Someone had broken into his house. The visitor had had a drink, smoked several of his cigarettes and had read his story. The visitor left him a note. \"I have read your story and I don't think it is very good. Please read my suggestions and you can finish it. By the way, I am a thief. I'm not going to steal anything tonight. But if you become a successful writer, I will return.\"\nJohn read the thief's suggestions. Then he sat down and wrote the rest of the story. He is still not a successful writer, and he is waiting for his \"visitor\" to return. Before he goes out in the evening, he always leaves a half-finished story in his study.", "id": "high1620.txt"}
