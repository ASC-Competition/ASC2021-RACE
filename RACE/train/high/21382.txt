Are they crazy about Britney Spears? Do they love the Backstreet Boys? Or do they dance to Eminem?\nWell, nearly 6,000 teens have taken part in a Teens & Music study, conducted by USA Weekend Magazine last autumn. And the results show what type of music is hot and what is not.\nIt comes as no surprise that hip-hop   and rap   are the most popular types of music among American teenagers. They began in the mid-1970s, with young black kids in New York, taking music onto the streets. Hip-hop and rap are well-known for the breakdancing   that goes with them.\nThe word \"rap\" comes from a 1960s slang   word for conversation. It is a rapid, slangy rhyme   that is spoken rather than sung.\nEminem is among the most popular rappers ever to hit the US. His first album \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" topped the American music chart   in May 2000. Although about a third of teens in the US showed their support for him, almost as many said that his music was so offensive that they couldn't listen to it.\nCompared with Eminem, actor-rapper Will Smith is more of a star for the kids. He was awarded the Wannabe Award, on April 12 at Nickelodeon's 16th Annual Kids' Choice Awards. It is an award given to a celebrity whom kids most want to be.\nPop music, such as Brittney Spears and the Backstreet Boys has always suited the tastes of the general public. It continues to enjoy support among teens and is second most popular after rap.\nThird is rock -- music with exciting dance beats   and simple lyrics that speak loudly of social problems. The melodies   are led by electric guitars. Rock became popular in the US in the early 1950s. American singer Elvis Presley and British group the Beatles became world-famous rock artists.\nThe study also showed that jazz is least loved by American teens. It developed in the latter part of the 19th century from a mixture of African work songs and hymns  . Jazz tends to be the type of music that people enjoy more as they get older.", "id": "high21382.txt"}
