However, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something.\n\"Forget about self-esteem,\" says one of the psychologists involved in the new research. \"It's not the most important thing.\"\nThis idea may sound a bit strange to you because studies also show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. In short, to feel good does you good.\nBut, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and evil people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said, \"There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.\"\nAll types of people have problems. \"People with high self-esteem can have big egos  that can make them less likeable to their peers,\" said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University. \"People with high self-esteem tend to   think more of themselves,\" Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help.\nResearchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail at something, try to learn from the experience. The best therapy , as they suggest, is to recognize your faults, accept yourself, understand your weaknesses and then do something about them.", "id": "high18802.txt"}
