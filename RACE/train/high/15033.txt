The day before she took her last breath I decided to ask her.\nFirst I wanted to make sure she could comprehend what I was saying. I told her I loved her, and she raised her eyebrows in acknowledgment. Then I shared a funny story about a conversation my sister and I had. The corners of her mouth turned up in a smile. I could tell that she was taking in every word. And then I went for it.\n\"Mom, can I ask you a serious question?\" She turned her head and opened her eyes fully. I could tell she wanted to grasp every word that came out of my mouth.\n\"Mom, do you see any of our dead relatives in the room? Do you see your dad?\" she shook her head.\nDo you see your mom?\" She shook her head again.\n\"Do you see dad?\" Her response was quite different this time. She began nodding her head.\n\"Is he here in this room right now?\" She nodded. \"Can he see me?\" She nodded again. Then she tried to communicate with words, but she couldn't get the words out.
