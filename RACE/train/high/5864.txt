They must learn to play every instrument; they must learn music history and music theory; they must learn instrument repair and teaching methods; they must learn conducting and so much more.At the same time, much of our culture and tradition is absorbed in music.\nMusic plays a very important role in our education.\nMusic helps with math and science. Students learn to count, and how to multiply and divide.Students also use science to help them discover what sounds good together and what doesn't.Students also need science to understand something called the \"overtone series\", which is about how music is produced by vibration and why.\nStudents learn a lot about languages through music.Many songs are written in other languages, including ancient ones.Students must learn to translate these works to understand what they are singing about. A song is likely to be a famous short work set to music; so students are exposed to that very often while singing.\nStudents learn a huge amount of cooperation  of body parts through music, so parts of the body can work better together.Students must use motor skills in order to play an instrument.Singers and wind players must learn breath control and be in good shape to play.\nStudents learn about art. Some famous pieces were written about important pieces of art, and students learn about the artists and styles as they're playing the music.\nMusic education also brings higher thinking to our children.It allows them to think about complex patterns.Students have to be aware of what every other musician does at every time.In that way, it develops cooperation, as well.They tend to develop more ability for learning.\nAs one can see, music is very important to education.", "id": "high5864.txt"}
