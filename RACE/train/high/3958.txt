He worked hard for many years.His friend Laboulaye died before the statue was completed.At last,in 1885,the statue was sent to the United States.It had to be shipped in sections and then put together for its weight and size.\nEver since then, 1886,the Statue of Liberty has stood as a symbol of freedom to millions of immigrants entering New York Harbor.", "id": "high3958.txt"}
