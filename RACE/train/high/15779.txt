He turned round and saw Walter Graham's car sinking into 8 feet of water of the inground swimming pool a little distance away from his yard. Kohout immediately called to Graham's wife, Evelyn, to phone 911. Then he ran back to his house to get Terence Reif and Glenn Fajardo to help, who were at work inside the house. \"There was no time for second thoughts,\" said Reif, a farmer's son. \"The only thing to do is to get in the pool.\"\nThe car doors were locked. Graham, 73, was unconscious, and his\nwas rapidly filling with water. Reif struggled to break the driver's side window with a hammer but had trouble getting it done underwater.\nFinally, some four minutes after the car had fallen into the pool, the glass was broken. By then, Graham was floating at the top of the flooded passenger compartment.\nThe three men pulled Graham out through the broken glass. He wasn't breathing and his heart stopped beating, so they performed mouth-to-mouth\n. The rescue team arrived in no time. Doctors supplied him with advanced life support on the way to the hospital.\n\"These people were getting to Graham through the glass,\" said Dr. Jeff. \"All three acted without regard for their own safety.\" Added Evelyn Graham, \"they were truly angels, watching over us\".", "id": "high15779.txt"}
