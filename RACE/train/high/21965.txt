They're almost always fun and interesting,and professors like them because students learn so much in just a few short months.\n    No one denies the value of classroom learning,but it can only take students so far.Slides and textbooks may do a good j ob of carrying facts and dates,but creativity and originality of thought cannot be taught.They can only be got through firsthand experience.", "id": "high21965.txt"}
