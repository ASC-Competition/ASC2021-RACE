It was one of those busy days...management meetings, sale calls, planning my travels, booking hotels, and the list was endless. By the end of the day, I was not only tired but was getting angry with myself and everyone around me. It was at this time that Paul invited me to his house for a \"chill out ( ).\"\nAlthough tired, I was all excited to chat up with Paul and share and learn through his rich experience in marketing. As we entered through the main door to his house, Paul started singing a song : I have a dream, to help me through in everything...and so on. I was in no mood to listen to his song; I wanted to hear about how he dealt with difficult sale calls!\nAs I told him about just that, I was totally surprised at what I saw next. Two young girls, aged between 17 and 20, walked over to Paul and hugged him. They couldn't walk steadily, and neither could they talk properly. Their faces were full of smiles and they also sang a song: No Mummy's kisses only Daddy's smiles. Nobody wants us. Daddy hugs us tonight.\nCurious to know, I asked Paul who these girls were. I knew that Paul lived in that house but I had never seen these girls. Paul explained:\n\"I also have a dream, a dream to make these girls happy. They are my daughters and they were born as 'special children'\". And he further added, \"They don't have a mother. My wife died when they were very young\", and that he is both mother and father to these beautiful daughters.\nI was moved to tears. In the office, no one knew what Paul was going through in his personal life. He never looked for any pity from his friends. In fact, he always helped us and encouraged us to move forward in life.\nI finished my tea and made my way out, when Paul said to me, \"All of us have dreams.\"", "id": "high21996.txt"}
