The doctor turned quickly and looked out the tall hospital window. The baby had been born without ears.\nTime proved that the baby's hearing was perfect. When he rushed home from school one day and threw himself into his mother's arms, she sighed, knowing that his life was to be full of heart- breaks for his imperfect appearance.\nHe grew up, handsome for his misfortune and popular with his fellow students. He might have been class monitor,but for that. He developed a gift, a talent for literature and music.\nTwo years went by. One day, his father said to the son, \"You're going to the hospital, son.

Real treasure lies not in what can be seen,but in what cannot be seen. Real love lies not in what is done and known, but in what is done and not known.", "id": "high8877.txt"}
