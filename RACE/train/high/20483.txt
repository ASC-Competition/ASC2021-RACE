But up on that lighthouse, with its broad spiral running up and around it like a black and white barber's pole, I saw my life twist into the air.\n    As I climbed the winding stairs, I counted the steps, 268 in all, stopping on 77, Dooriya's very number of days on this planet.At the top, I held Dooriya up to the Atlantic, its cold air raising the thin soft hair on her head.With her eyes closed and her arms spread out, it looked like she was bathing in the warmth of the sun.", "id": "high20483.txt"}
