Although you most likely need some money, you stand on ceremony and won't ask for it yourself. Now then, we agree on thirty rubles a month...\"\n\" Forty.\"\n\" No, thirty. I made a note of it. I always pay the governess thirty. Now then, you've been here two months, so...\"\n\" Two months and five days.\"\n\" Exactly two months. I made a specific note of it. That means you have sixty rubles coming to you. Subtract nine Sundays... you know you didn't work with Kolya on Sundays, you only took walks. And three holidays...\"\nJulia Vassilyevna flushed a deep red and picked at the flounce of her dress, but--- not a word.\n\" Three holidays, therefore take off twelve rubles. Four days Kolya was sick and there were no lessons, as you were occupied only with Vanya. Three days you had a toothache and my wife gave you permission not to work after lunch. Twelve and seven---nineteen. Subtract...that leaves...hmm...forty-one rubles. Correct?\"\nJulia Vassilyena's left eye reddened and filled with moisture. Her chin trembled; she coughed nervously and blew her nose, but---not a word.\n\" Around New Year's you broke a teacup and saucer: take off two rubles. The cup cost more, it was an heirloom, but---let it go. When didn't I take a loss? Then, due to your neglect, Kolya climbed a tree and tore his jacket: take off ten. Also due to your heedlessness the maid stole Vanya's shoes. You ought to watch everything! You get paid for it. So, that means five more rubles off. The tenth of January I gave you ten rubles...\"\n\" You didn't \" whispered Julia Vassilyevna.\n\" But I made a note of it.\"\n\" Well...all right.\"\n\" Take twenty-seven from forty-one ---that leaves fourteen.\"\nBoth eyes filled with tears. Perspiration appeared on the thin, pretty little nose. Poor girl!\n\" Only once was I given any money,\" she said in a trembling voice, \" and that was by your wife. Three rubles, nothing more.\"\n\" Really? You see now, and I didn't make a note of it! Take three from fourteen... leaves eleven. Here's your money, my dear. Three , three, three, one and one. Here it is!\"\nI handed her eleven rubles. She took them and with trembling fingers stuffed them into her pocket.\n\" Merci,\" she whispered.\nI jumped up and started pacing the room. I was overcome with anger.\n\" For what, this ---'merci'?\" I asked.\n\" For the money.\"\n\" But you know I've cheated you, God's sake---robbed you! I have actually stolen from you! Why this 'merci'?\"\n\" In my other places they didn't give me anything at all.\"\n\" They didn't give you anything? No wonder! I played a little joke on you, a cruel lesson, just to teach you ... I'm going to give you the entire eighty rubles! Here they are in an envelope all ready for you... Is it really possible to be so spineless? Why don't you protest? Why be silent? Is it possible in this world to be without teeth and claws--- to be such a nincompoop?\"\nShe smiled crookedly and I read in her expression: \" It is possible.\"\nI asked her pardon for the cruel lesson and , to her great surprise, gave her the eighty rubles. She murmured her litter \"merci\" several times and went out. I looked after her and thought: \"How easy it is to crush the weak in this world!\"", "id": "high15197.txt"}
