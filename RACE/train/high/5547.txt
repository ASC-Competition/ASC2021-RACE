Venusian scientists managed to land a satellite on the planet Earth, and it has been sending back signals as well as photographs ever since.\nThe satellite was directed into an area known as Manhattan, named after the great Venusian astronomer Professor. Manhattan, who first discovered it with his telescope 20000 light years ago.\nBecause of excellent weather conditions and extremely strong signals, Venusian scientists were able to get valuable information as to feasibility   of a manned flying saucer landing on Earth. A press conference was held at the Venus Institute of Technology.\n\"We have come to the conclusion, based on last week's satellite landing,\" Prof. Zog said, \"that there is no life on Earth.\"\n\"How do you know this?\" the science reporter of the Venus Evening Star asked.\n\"For one thing, Earth's surface in the area of Manhattan is made up of solid concrete and nothing can grow there. For another, the atmosphere is filled with carbon monoxide   and other deadly gases and nobody could possibly breathe this air and survive.\"\n\"What does this mean as far as our flying saucer program is concerned?\"\n\"We shall have to take our own oxygen with us, which means a much heavier flying saucer than originally planned.\"\n\"Are there any other dangers that you discovered in your studies?\"\n\"Take a look at this photo. You see this dark black cloud hovering   over the surface of Earth? We don't know what it is made of, but it could give us a lot of trouble and we shall have further tests before we send a Venus Being there.\"\n\"Over here you will notice what seems to be a river, but the satellite findings indicates it is polluted and the water is unfit to drink. This means we shall have to carry our own water, which will add even greater weight to the saucer.\"\n\"If all you say is true, won't this set back the flying saucer program several years?\"\n\"Yes, but we shall continue as soon as the Grubstart gives us the added funds .\" Profession.
