The poor will bear the burden of it. The frontline experience of many of us working in international development indicates that communities are having to fight against more extreme weather conditions.\"\nClimate change will play havoc   with agriculture and water supplies and will increase diseases. \"By 2025 the proportion of the world's population living in countries of great water stress will almost double, to 6 billion people. Tropical and sub-tropical areas will be hardest hit -- those countries already suffering from food shortage\".\nPoor countries mostly do not need high-tech solutions, but would most benefit from education, research and being shown how to farm better. The report says unchecked global warming, more than wars or political confusion, will displace millions of people and destabilize   many countries.", "id": "high16132.txt"}
