In fact,if you're not careful,you can even hurt yourself,by using the wrong word in your writing.\nRecently a friend sent me a copy of an email she received from the customer service department of her credit card company,after she contacted them with a question about her account. She was happy with their positive response. But as I read the email,one line jumped out at me:\"In lieu of good customer service...\"\nDid they really mean they were offering her a few extra reward points instead of good customer service?I doubt it. More likely,what the customer service department meant to say was,\"Because good customer service is important to us...\" followed by the details of what they were doing to make sure she remained a happy customer.\nSo why didn't the writer say that?I can only guess that perhaps the writer liked the phrase \"in lieu of\",thought it sounded more interesting than saying \"because\",and so used it--without bothering to check the true meaning.\nHave you ever done that?Try to impress others with a big word,only to find out you've used the word incorrectly?It's just the opposite effect,isn't it?You may impress people all right,but it's not the impression you were going for.\nWhen you write,remember to choose your words carefully. People may still disagree with what you say,but they won't be able to dismiss you because you made careless mistakes in how you said it.", "id": "high8380.txt"}
