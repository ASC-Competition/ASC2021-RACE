For years I have had noisy neighbours. Ever since I moved into this flat, I've had to put up with noise during the night. I decided I'd had enough and I've been looking for a new flat since the beginning of the year. I haven't found anything till now. Every week I go to the estate agent's office, but it's the same story. \"I might have something by the end of the week\" he says, or, \"Wait till next week. I think I might have a few flats by then.\" I've seen a few flats during my search, but I don't like any of them. One flat I saw has been empty for two years. \"It's got a busy road on one side and a railway on the other!\" I said loudly, \"I want peace and quiet.\" Last week I visited the agent again. \"I won't leave till you show me something,\" I said. \"I've got just the flat for you.\" I went to see it and I was frightened. \"But it's next to a cemetery!\" I cried. \"But you won't have noisy neighbours,\" my agent said. \"It's exactly right for peace and quiet!\"", "id": "high12444.txt"}
