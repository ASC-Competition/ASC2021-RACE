And because of this we have forgotten just how important gratitude is and how essential it is in leading fulfilled   lives.\nJust for a minute, think of all the things you are grateful for, such as loving friends, good health, great holidays as well as everyday items such as a comfortable home, TV, and clean water. The list, in fact, could go on and on.\nNow focus on events that have made you angry -- it's raining, the car won't start, and a colleague   makes you annoyed. You start to feel unhappy, and that is something that certainly does not make you feel good!\nIn fact, we have the ability to choose how we feel -- it's just our perception   of how things are. But for most of us, it just doesn't seem easy.\nLet me give you an example: it's a rainy day, and immediately most people will start to complain, telling everyone who will listen what a miserable day it is, with the result that they end up feeling miserable themselves. But look at it another way and despite wet clothes and hair, both will dry perfectly well and no lasting harm has been done. And in addition to this, because of rain, we not only live in a green and beautiful landscape, we are also able to grow a lot of fruit and vegetables.\nThere really is no obvious reason for feeling miserable -- in fact there is a great deal to be grateful for. It all depends on what we think about things.\nRealize what a difference having gratitude can make to your life. That's why gratitude is so special -- use it to feel good!", "id": "high16188.txt"}
