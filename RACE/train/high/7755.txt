Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer.\nTelevision advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease.\nInitial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment.\n\"We believe it works by getting into the tumor  cells and causing them to self-destruct. But the exact mechanism by which it works is not totally clear. It's not useful for people who have a primary melanoma. The treatment of primary melanoma is surgical excision ,\"he said. \"It's useful to inject tumors for people who have recurrences; when the primary treatment has failed and when recurrence in the area, or at more distant sites has occurred.\"\nAbout 90 percent of Australians who develop melanoma survive thanks to early diagnosis and treatment. If left untreated, however, the disease can be fatal.\nConvincing younger people in Australia about the dangers of overexposure to the sun is a battle campaigners are constantly waging.\nVeronica Manock, a 21-year-old student, had two major operations to remove a cancerous tumor from her leg.\n\"I've had a lot of friends who just said 'I thought it was just, you know, I'll get a mole  cut out and that's it', whereas I don't think people realize how much danger they're putting themselves into and how easy it is to stop something like this happening to you just from doing little things,\"said Marock.\nOther researchers in Australia are investigating genetic treatments to skin cancer. There is a pressing need for such research to produce effective treatments. Australians, the majority of whom are fair-skinned , are four times more likely to develop a melanoma than people in Canada, the United States or Great Britain.", "id": "high7755.txt"}
