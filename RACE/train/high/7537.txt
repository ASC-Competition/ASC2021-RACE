After all, this is the 1990s and the idea of children working is just unthinkable. That is, until you are told that they are all pupils of stage schools, and that the \"work\" they go off to is to go on the stage in a theatre.\nStage schools often act as agencies to supply children for stage and television work. More worthy of the name \"stage school\" are those few places where children attend full time, with a training for the theatre and a general education.\nA visit to such schools will leave you in no doubt that the children enjoy themselves.
