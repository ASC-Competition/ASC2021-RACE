But her career path reached a crossroad when her second child was born,and she left her job in February 2007. Hoffman is one of many people who have left the work force to take a break,but she has a position as a consultant.She has described this type of career detour  ----- which is more common for women than for men--as \"off- ramping.\" Typically it occurs when the balancing act of parenting and work becomes too tough.\nA study by the center found that more than 90 percent of women who off-ramp want to on-ramp back into the work force eventually.But making the transition back to work is rarely easy,and it is even harder in this economic climate of layoffs and hiring freezes.\nConsidering some of the obstacles faced by on- rampers , a three-day program called \"Greater Returns:Restarting Your Career\" was held at Columbia University. The goal of the three days was to have them walk away with a big shot of confidence.\nAccording to one school of thought, women looking to make a comeback might even have an advantage in the current economy,especially if they are looking for part-time or consultant positions that do not offer benefits. And a majority of on-rampers are women with extensive working experiences that could give them a slight advantage over less-experienced competition.\n\"You absolutely cannot be defensive about why you off-ramped,\" Ms Hoffman says, \" defensive\" would have put her into a hard situation if the Greater Returns program had had not taught her how to describe the years she spent at home.\"I now feel confident talking to an employer and saying,' Yes,I have been out of the work force,but here is where I can make significant contributions.'\"", "id": "high2333.txt"}
