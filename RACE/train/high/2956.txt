Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years.\nA drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter  has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant.\nTwenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing  a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21.\nReformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \"responsible attitudes\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink.\nThough new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \"obviously drunk\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy.\nAs the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition  of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \"noble experiment\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution.", "id": "high2956.txt"}
