She is being recognized today for her global activism on education for girls. Winning this award is a huge honor, especially for such a young person.\nMalala's journey to the Nobel Prize has not been easy. She grew up in a dangerous district of Pakistan called the Swat Valley. This area was taken over by the Taliban. The Taliban ruled the district with an iron fist. They were especially cruel to women, not allowing them to go shopping, have jobs, or go to school.\nIn 2009, Malala began speaking out publicly for every girl's right to an education. She blogged about how the Taliban didn't want her to go to school. She also continued to attend her local school, despite the danger involved.\nThen, in 2012, the Taliban tried to kill Malala to silence her. Two Taliban gunmen shot her and two other students while they were on a school bus. Malala was flown to the United Kingdom for immediate medical treatment.\nMalala eventually recovered from her injuries.  She now lives in Birmingham, England, and continues to work hard to support girls' and women's rights around the world.\n\"The terrorists thought that they would change my aims and stop my ambitions,\" she said, \"but nothing changed in my life except this. Weakness, fear, and hopelessness died. Strength, power, and courage were born.\"\nThe 17-year-old girl from Pakistan is sharing the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize with a children's activist Kailash Satyarthi, who is from India Satyarthi leads many campaigns dedicated to removing child labor.", "id": "high13578.txt"}
