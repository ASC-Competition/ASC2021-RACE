Every morning, her ten-year-old boy puts up one finger with his eyes still closed, begging for one more minute to sleep.\nWhy is he so sleepy? Because, like thousands of student \"early birds\" in China, he has to get up before 6 a.m. every morning.\nSchool students usually need eight to ten hours' sleep a night. But in Shanghai, it's reported that 90% of the students do not get enough sleep. And studies show that without a good night's sleep, students seem to be weaker than they should be. Many become near-sighted as a result.\nLi Ming, a student at Qinghua High School, said that he usually goes to bed after 11 p.m. But when he has exams coming up, he can stay up as late as midnight. This \"night bird\" lifestyle has made many students nod off in class. Li Ming said that it is during afternoon classes that he feel most sleepy. \"My parents are usually happy to see me studying so late,\" he said. \"They think I work very hard and they make me cups of coffee.\"\nHowever, not all parents are happy about this. \"My daughter gets up so early. She looks tired and it really hurts me.\" said one of the parents. Why don't so many students get enough sleep? Now many members of society began to think about it.", "id": "high5412.txt"}
