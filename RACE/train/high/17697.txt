The center was set up to help immigrant families. She happened to meet adults in an EFL (English as a foreign language) class. \"When I saw them struggling hard, I wondered how people in poor countries could learn English,\" Ellie said.\nSo she started a Website, \"Repeat After Us\", where people can listen to English and practice their accents. Volunteers have helped Ellie record more than 6,600 texts, including Abraham Lincoln's \"Gettysburg Address\". \nHard work _ There were so many times that Ellie was discouraged, but she stuck to it. The Website crashed early on, and all the recordings were lost. But volunteers worked together vigorously to start over, and the visitors returned to the site.     \n   \"Just follow your idea and know that the world is so kind. Even if you do have trouble, people will help you,\" Ellie said.\n   \"I was really excited the first month, when we had 49 visitors,\" she said. Now, more than 480,000 people from all over the world have visited the site. \"I get e-mails fromChina,Egypt,India, andBrazil. They say, 'Thank you so much for this resource, we've been waiting for it for so long!'\" Ellie loves knowing she is helping so many people.\nGloria Barron Prize winners like Ellie are enthusiastic about the work they do. And they encourage others to join in if they see a need. Anybody can be negative, but it takes somebody brave to be positive. Are you the brave one?", "id": "high17697.txt"}
