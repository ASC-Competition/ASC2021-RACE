Simple.I wanted to see if the effect it had on me was a keeper.After reading the last word of the e-book, I totally agreed with the subtitle which promised to forever change the way we thought about money.I had so many thoughts running around my mind that I had to install  a stoplight to stop some while others made their way into the picture, then I yielded  them as a few ones arrived in town.\n.\nIt has been a week and the effect is the same.I truly do look at money differently and have even done a few things differently this week.This is an e-book you'll want to read, I promise.I often recommend books to my daughter, and this is one that I didn't just \"suggest\"---I left it open at the bottom of the computer and told each one, \"Read it, you'll love it.\"\nI would never point someone in a direction I wouldn't go myself.I urge you to visit the author's website,\n, and to download the e-book.You won't regret it.", "id": "high15960.txt"}
