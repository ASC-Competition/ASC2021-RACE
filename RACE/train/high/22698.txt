However, after returning home from being abroad for a long period, many people can suffer from the problem of reverse   culture shock. Reverse culture shock is a condition that happens when you return home and find things have changed greatly from how you have remembered them while you are away. It develops feelings of anxiety, hostility   and boredom.\n         One of the biggest change people encounter   when returning home after spending a great deal of time abroad is that their relationships with friends and family are not as familiar as they once used to be.\n         While reverse culture shock is a very common condition, there are actually many ways you can deal with and lessen the effects of this condition.\n         Posting a regular blog, or updating your status   on Facebook or Twitter, can really help to keep your friendships with people back at home. The best thing about posting regular updates is that your friends and family always know what you are getting up to, so they won't be surprised by the changes they see in you when you do finally return home. You could even ask close family and friends to keep you updated on life at home so you are not left feeling shocked by changes that might happen while you are away.\n        If you are left feeling a bit upset that none of your friends want to hear all about your amazing travel stories when you get home, then why not try sharing the world with them by writing online travel reviews. For those who are considering travelling abroad, your experiences could prove very useful, and may even encourage them to do some of the things you are lucky enough to have experienced while you were away.", "id": "high22698.txt"}
