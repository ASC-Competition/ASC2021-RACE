Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. The message becomes clear: \"R U awake?\"\nBrandon' s use of technology doesn' t stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles ( ) in his room. With so many choices, it' s no surprise that when he isn' t at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices\nBrandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, kids aged 8 to18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found.\nThe jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. Today, nearly seven out of ten kids have cell phones. Just five years ago, it was four out of ten.\nOften, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \" If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" media expert Cheryl Olson says.\nMost experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \" It' s a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\" You've got to work on it. \"\nMultitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It' s important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply, \" says Rideout.\nWith new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use in check is more important than ever. \" Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \" But parents might have to step in sometimes. \"", "id": "high2180.txt"}
