She would be his wife soon. She was in China, visiting her parents. Her son Bradley hadn't gone with her. Bradley was a junior in high school. He neither liked nor disliked Zach, even though he had known Zach for three years. Zach was still trying to get along well with Bradley.\nWhen Zach arrived, he asked if Bradley wanted to drive his car. Bradley had a driver's license. Bradley said all right. Zach told him not to drive fast, but that he could drive anywhere he wanted. Bradley got on the road. Zach gave Bradley a few driving tips: Don't drive next to big trucks, because you never know when they might crush  you. Don't drive behind trucks filled with things, because you never know when something in the truck will fly out and hit your car.\nOn their way back, Zach suggested that they stop at the golf course. He wanted to show Bradley how to play golf. Bradley wasn't interested. He preferred his video games. But Bradley soon discovered that golf was fun! He hit a lot of balls. Zach told him that he was doing well. The next day Bradley, for the first time ever, called Zach. He had a few blisters  on his hands. Zach said that usually happened. Then Bradley asked if Zach would come next Saturday so they could take a drive and hit golf balls again. Zach said, of course, and felt happy.", "id": "high3260.txt"}
