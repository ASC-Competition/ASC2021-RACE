Daylight Saving Time (DST) refers to the time during the summer when clocks are one hour ahead of standard time.\n\"Daylight saving was created to save energy, and it doesn't really do that.\" Proud said, \"but what's even worse are its negative health effects. It's both outdated and harmful.\" daylight saving has been linked to a surprising number of health issues such as heart attacks, but Proud has a particular interest in the topic because of its disruptive  effects on sleep.\nLast year, German researchers suggested that our body cocks never really adjust t daylight saving, which causes a host of health problems. Till Roenneberg of Ludwig-Maximillians University said that because of DST, \"the majority of the population has severely decreased productivity, decreased quality of life, increasing chance of getting illness, and is just plain tired.\"\nThe week after daylight saving also witnesses a sudden increase in fatal traffic accidents, according to the University of Colorado. It is believed that this is caused both by disrupted sleep schedules and the shift of daylight hours from the morning to the evening.\n\"Daylight saving is an economic tradition. And all economic choices involve achieving a balance. \" said behavioral economist David Gerard. \"Even if we decide to abolish daylight saving, there would be a large number of unhappy people.\"\nSome such people are shift works, students and parents of schoolchildren, all of whom get to enjoy an extra hour of daylight after work or class with DST. Plus, restaurants love the extra evening sales DST allows.\nDaylight saving has also been linked to lower crime rates, due to the \"deterrent effect\" of longer daylight. Basically, more light increase a criminal's chances of being seen by witnesses or police, which discourages criminal activity.\nGerard also point out that an extra hour of daylight has vastly more influence in the American South, where the sun sets earlier, even in the summer, than in the north. That's why residents of southern states may values DST more.", "id": "high19685.txt"}
