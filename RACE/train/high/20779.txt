The report \"paints a discouraging future for America if it were to continue on the  _ path it has been following'':\n    * U.S. K-12 education in mathematics and science ranks 48thworldwide.\n    * 49%of U.S. adults don't know how long it takes for the Earth to circle the sun. \n    Although US school achievement scores have stagnated, harming the economy as employers look elsewhere for competent workers, the report says that other nations have made gains. \n    If the USA's students matched Finland's, for example, analysis suggests the US economy would grow 9%-16%. \"The real point is that we have to have a well-educated workforce to create  opportunities for young people,\" says Charles Vest,head of the National Academy of Engineering, a report sponsor. \"Otherwise, we don't have a chance.\"\n   \"The current economic crisis makes the link between education and employment very clear,'' says Steven Newton of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland. \n    In 2007, however, an analysis led by B. Lindsay Lowell of Georgetown University found that worries about US science education were overblown . It saw three times more science and engineering college graduates than job openings each year. Other reports have found top science and engineering students migrating to better-paying jobs in finance, law and medicine since the  1900s.", "id": "high20779.txt"}
