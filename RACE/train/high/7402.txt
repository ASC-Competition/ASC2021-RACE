When I went to the local government after finishing everything, I was surprised to find that they'd stopped issuing permits for Internet cafes.\"\nHaving an Internet cafe without Internet is much like having a coffee shop without coffee. \"I'm avoiding closing the place, but it's been more than three months with the situation ongoing as it is.\" Obeidallah said. \"Who will bear the losses caused by the permit issue?\"\nThe decision took many cafe owners by surprise. \"I asked to open an Internet cafe, and I was handed a list of all the things that were needed to follow through, such as a sign for the place, filling out forms,\" said Hassan Al-Harbi.\n\"I did all that was asked and rented a place. And after the Haj vacation I went to the local government and they surprised me, saying that there are new rules that forbid the issuing of any more Internet cafe permits and that one can't even renew his permit. I've lost more than SR80,000,\" Al-harbi added.\nAs for the government, officials say a method to deal with it is on the way. But security concerns come before profit .", "id": "high7402.txt"}
