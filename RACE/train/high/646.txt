His wife, Gerrie, was still working in the local school cafeteria  , but work for Dave was scarce (,), and the price of everything was rising. The Fusses were at risk of joining the millions of Americans who have lost their homes in recent years. Then Dave and Gerrie received a timely gift--$7,000,a legacy   from their neighbors Ish and Arlene Hatch, who died in an accident . \" It really made a difference when we were going under financially, \" says Dave.\nBut the Fusses weren't the only folks in Alto and the neighboring town of Lowell to receive unexpected legacy from the Hatches. Dozens of   other families were touched by the Hatches' generosity. In some cases, it was a few thousand dollars ; in others, it was more than $100,000.\nIt surprised nearly everyone that the Hatches had so much money, more than $3 million--they were an elderly couple who lived in an old house on what was left of the family farm .\nChildren of the Great Depression, Ish and Arlene were known for their habit of saving, They thrived on comparison shopping and would routinely go from store to store, checking prices before making a new purchase   .\nThrough the years, the Hatches paid for local children to attend summer camp when their parents couldn't afford it. \"Ish and Arlene never asked if you needed anything,\" says their friend Sand Van Weelden, \"They could see things they could do to make you happier, and they would do them.\nEven more extraordinary was that the Hatches had their farmland distributed (;). It was the Hatches' wish that their legacy--a legacy of kindness as much as one of dollars and cents should enrich the whole community and last for generations to come.\nNeighbors helping neighbors ----that was Ish and Arlene Hatch's story.", "id": "high646.txt"}
