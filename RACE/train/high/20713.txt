C., Canada, told Stephen Covey about plans to participate in local citizens in their fight against youth crime, the leadership consultant   was doubtful. He was sure the city's problems would prove \"too complex\" for ordinary people to make a difference. \n    But Covey forgot about the trim-tabbers-people who solve scaring problems through small acts. By arranging safe and fun places for youths to go, residents have lowered Richmond's under-18 crime rate 32% in the last year. Police in 53 countries are now studying the Richmond model.\n    What impresses Covey is that the people in Richmond chose to do something rather than sit back and complain. And that, he says, is how everyday people can exhibit \"everyday greatness\".\n    A man going through a painful divorce chose to look outside himself and found a meaningful project where he could make a difference.

Combs Elementary School in Raleigh, North Carolina, told parents and teachers on the concept of \"character\" education, stressing that academic achievement can't be separated from principles of responsibility and purpose. In recent tests, 94% of her students performed at or above grade level, compared to 67% eight years ago.\nTo Covey, these everyday people are models because they weren't afraid to take on scaring challenges. No matter how difficult it was, they chose to act.", "id": "high20713.txt"}
