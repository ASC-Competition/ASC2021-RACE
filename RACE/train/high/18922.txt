Eight years ago, audio   engineer Gordon Hempton identified the quietest place in the continental United States. He calls the place \"One Square Inch of Silence.\" He has used his symbolic spot in a northwestern rain forest to campaign against noise pollution. But the self-described \"Sound Tracker\" is now going deaf.\nFor Gordon Hempton, it started with an experience known to many people. \"I was lying in the bed in the springtime about a year ago. The sun was shining. The birds could be singing. They should be singing. But I was hearing none. I knew my life was going to be different.\"\nHempton's eyes get watery as he describes his cruel situation. More than 20 years ago he trademarked his nickname as \"The Sound Tracker.\" Sharp hearing defined his career as an Emmy award winning sound recordist. It also led to his activism against noise pollution. He has circled the globe three times in search of the perfect sounds of nature.\nHempton says his hearing loss is quickly getting worse but he has to finish his project.\n\"I am running a race to finish the Quiet Planet collection.\" That's the title of a planned 19-volume set of nature recordings. The sound tracks could be licensed for use in movies, video games, exhibits, plays and the like. Volunteer assistants now help Hempton review and edit sound files and identify imperfections.\nThe exact cause of his hearing loss is not clear. Doctors say it may be the result of an infection, or a tumor   or a combination of things. Hempton is self-employed. His health care plan does not pay for hearing loss treatment. So, for now, he's directing his attention to completing his \"greatest hits\" album. \"After I get it finished, I have an economic cash flow to get my hearing back. That's the first thing on my to-do list.\" He's hopeful his hearing loss can be recovered.", "id": "high18922.txt"}
