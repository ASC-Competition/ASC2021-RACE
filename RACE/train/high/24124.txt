And it also gets them thinking about Thanksgiving, about their lives, and about their biggest homework of the year--to find a way they can change the world.\" \nLast year, 12-year-old Christian D. taught basic soccer skills to 63 kids with cancer. Christian's classmate Brianna used the money she had raised to buy 56 teddy bears. She donated them to a woman's shelter. Both students say the experience taught them something they'll never forget: When we give something to others, we're really giving thanks. And giving thanks feels good.  \n\"Helping the woman smile, if just for a day, made me feel like I could make a difference,\" Brianna says. \"And it taught me that I should always be thankful for what I have.\"\nBrianna's happiness is something Jeffrey Froh knows about. Froh studies how gratitude affects a person's mind and attitudes. Those who are thankful are more likely to help others. Grateful people and kids in particular are healthier and happier than those who are not.\n\"Grateful kids tend to be happier and more satisfied with their lives,\" Froh says. \"Kids who give thanks are happier with school, their families and their friends. Grateful children also feel less envy toward others, are less likely to be depressed and even do better in school.\" \n\"To experience gratitude,\" says Froh, \"a couple of things have to happen. First you have to notice that there is goodness in your life. Then you have to admit that the reason for that goodness lies partially outside of yourself.\"", "id": "high24124.txt"}
