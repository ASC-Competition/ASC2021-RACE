With its shocking green body, red mouth, long tail and noisy screech , the rose-ringed parakeet   brought a vivid colour to parks in and around London.\nHowever, the parakeets are no longer welcome. The government has suddenly woken up to the fact that there are many more parakeets in and around London making life harder for the local bird population. Government experts put the number of parakeets at around 30,000. They fear that if the number of parakeets keeps rising, these birds will push out local birds like wood-peckers, starlings and nuthatches from trees to build their own nests.\nNot only that. According to an online report by The Independent, the parakeets will then also get control of most of the food available in the parks -- seeds, berries, fruit and nuts. The local bird population will then have a hard time staying alive. An organization called the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has asked the government to investigate   what kind of a threat the parakeet brings to local birds. If the government decides that these birds are indeed a threat to local birds, steps will be taken to control the number of parakeets.\nThe most surprising thing about the case of the rose-ringed parakeet is that no one quite knows how the parakeets came from India and started breeding   in areas around London.", "id": "high2377.txt"}
