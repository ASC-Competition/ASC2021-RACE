It consisted of a control unit with three small units.  I put the control unit in the sitting-room and fastened the other units by the front door, back door and living-room windows. The instructions told us to choose three numbers, so we chose 491, the last three numbers of our telephone number.\nNow I will explain how the alarm works:\n1. There is a power siren in the control unit. It makes a very loud noise.\n2. Each of the small units sends out beams or rays in different directions. If anything moves, it breaks a beam. This sends signal to the control unit. The siren makes a noise which you can hear 50 meters away.\n3. When we go to bed, I press the three buttons numbered 4, 9 and 1. Then we have 30 seconds to get out of the room before the alarm starts to work. That night I slept soundly because I was sure that no burglar could get into our house. However, at about 2:10 a. m. , I woke up and heard the siren.\n\"There must be a burglar in the house?\" Mary said, \"What shall we do?\"\n\"I'll go and see who's there,\" I said, \"Stay here. Don't make a noise. \"\nI went down stairs quietly. When I reached the living-room, I switched on my torch and looked round the room. Then I turned the light on. I switched the siren off and searched the rooms downstairs. There was nothing wrong except that the back door was unlocked. I locked it, re-set the alarm and went back to bed.\nAbout an hour later, the alarm started again. I jumped out of bed, fell over a chair in the dark and bumped into the bedroom door. Mary woke up and started hitting me with a torch. \"Hey! Wait a minute!\" I whispered, \"It's only me. I'm going downstairs to see what's wrong.\"\nI went down into the living-room and listened for a moment. The only sound I could hear was the siren. I tamed on the light and switched the siren off. As I did so, I glanced across at the curtains in front of the windows. I saw a house lizard (a kind of small animals)  disappear behind the curtains.\n\"Oh!\" I said to myself. \"That's our burglar.\"\nWhen the lizard moved, it started the siren. I guessed the alarm had been made in Europe, where there are no house lizards.\nWell, I won't finish this story but if you want an alarm system free of charge, let me know. I'll send you ours. We bought a dog this morning. It knows the difference between a lizard and a burglar .", "id": "high8903.txt"}
