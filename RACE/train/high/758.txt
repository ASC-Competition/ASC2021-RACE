They must be ready for immediate use when fire breaks out. Most portable   kinds operate for less than a minute, so they are useful only on small fires. The law requires  ships, trains, buses and planes to carry extinguishers.\nSince fuel, oxygen and heat must be present in order for fire to exist, one or more of these things must be removed or reduced to put out a fire. If the heat is reduced by cooling the material below a certain temperature, the fire goes out. The cooling method is the most common way to put out a fire. Water is the best cooling material because it is low in cost and easy to get.\nAnother method of extinguishing fire is by cutting off the oxygen. This is usually done by covering the fire with sand, steam or some other things. A blanket may be used to cover a small fire.\nA third method is called separation, which includes removing the fuel, or material easy to burn from a fire, so that it can find no fuel.\nThe method that is used to put out a fire depends on the type of fire. Fires have been grouped in three classes. Fires in wood, paper, cloth and the like are called Class A fires. These materials usually help keep the fire on. Such fires can be stopped most readily by cooling with water.", "id": "high758.txt"}
