But don't deny small talks just yet.\nPsychologists have long said that connecting with others is important to well-being, but just how much conversation we require is under investigation. In one study, researchers overheard  undergraduates for four days, and then cataloged each overheard conversation as either \"small talks\" (\"What do you have done? Popcorn? Yummy!\") or \"substantive\" (\"So did they get divorced soon after?\"). They found that the second type correlated  with happiness --the happiest students had roughly twice as many substantive talks as the unhappiest ones. Small talks, meanwhile, made up only 10 percent of their conversation, versus almost 30 percent of their conversation among the least content students.\nBut don't deny small talks just yet. Scientists believe that small talks could promote bonding. Researchers found that a small talk maintains closeness with loved ones after studying ring-tailed lemurs'  call-and-response conversations, similar to human small talks. Still, joking with strangers could brighten your morning. In a series of experiments, those bus-takers told to chat with others are reported a more pleasant journey than those told to \"enjoy your solitude\" or to do whatever they normally would. Small talks can also help us feel connected to our surroundings. People who smiled at, made eye contact with, and briefly spoke with their Starbucks baristas   reported a greater sense of belonging than those who rushed through the transaction.\nOf course, some of us are better than others at turning small talks into something bigger. All the differences come to what researchers call \"a curious mindset\".\nSo go ahead to talk and inquire. Small talks needn't be idle. And being curious about others' business isn't all bad.", "id": "high14975.txt"}
