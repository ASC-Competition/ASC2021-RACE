Similar changes in behavior have been observed in polar bears and yellow-eyed penguins in areas visited by colorists are producing smaller babies.\nConservationists are now calling for more research into the effect of ecotourism on animals and say the industry must be developed carefully. They also want studies done before new ecotourism projects are started.\n _ said Rochelle Constantine of the University of Auckland in New Zealand", "id": "high5736.txt"}
