King's new ghost story, Riding the Bullet is only available on the Internet. The story - which King wrote while he was recovering from serious injuries which happened to him in a hit - and - run accident near his summer home in Maine last year - produced instant traffic blocks on the Web the moment it became published and availed online at 12:01 a. m. Tuesday.\nKing gave out a statement saying \"he is curious to see what sort of reaction there is and whether or not this is the future of publishing.\" He is not the first author to make his work available wholly online, but he is the first among the top ranks of writers to take that step.\nKing told Time magazine that his experiment with putting his story Riding the Bullet on the Internet has been so successful that he is considering putting a fulllength book online. \"The new way of publishing\", said King, \"could exactly change the way people regard reading.\" The story was put out fully over the Web and it will only be available on the Internet, as an \"e - book\". It was given away for free the first 24 hours. After that readers could download it for $ 2.50. As of Sunday, more than 5,000,000 people had downloaded the piece. \nSimon & Schuster, which is electronically publishing the e - book, says 4,000,000 readers ordered it in the first 24 hours during which it was available. The company is now in talks with other authors about publishing more e - books. Publishers say King's decision to publish the story fully online shows that the e - book format  is here to stay. King himself says the Internet has great promise as a way to share our literature, but he doesn't think \"anything will take the place of the printed word and the book with a cover.\"", "id": "high22911.txt"}
