Do you expect your date to pay for the whole meal?\nMany people say that as long as there's love, money doesn't matter much. But this might change when the relationship gets serious and it is related to the money borrowed from the bank, the family present accounts and debt.\nA survey among 8 million couples in the UK suggested that 44% of married couples don't know exactly what their partner earns. An astonishing 23% actively try to keep their finances  secret from their partners. About 38% of them are open to each other. Another 12% refuses to tell the truth.\nBritish relationship expert Russell says: \"It's very difficult to talk about money. Often there's guilt, there's shame. To start those conversations is difficult. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It's not just a simple case of talking about hard cash.\"\nSo if you are in a couple, it might be a good idea to check if you both are on the same page about money before bills pile up on the kitchen table and love flies out of the window. When moving in together, couples should not only talk about their personal habits but also about their financial ones.\nRussell has a word of advice: \"Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently - there might be a spender or a saver. It's very attractive if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. Do it differently but plan it well.\"\nAnd now, back to that date. Would you be bored with someone who was attractive but expected you to pay the bill by yourself? There's food for thought.", "id": "high19787.txt"}
