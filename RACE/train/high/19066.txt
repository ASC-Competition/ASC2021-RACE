And she doesn't look a day over fifty. \"\n       He has been careful not to use the word \"old\". In a society where youth is so admired, old age is often seen as something sad, something to fight against. Americans prefer not to say \"old\" people. They use the expression \"senior citizens\". They do not talk about \"old people's\" homes, but \"retirement\" homes.\n       In fact, the entertainer is not so wrong. Seventy is not very old these days. People in theprefix = st1 /USare living longer and longer. In1980, 12 percent of Americans were over sixty-five years old. By 2030, 21 percent will be over sixty-five. One reason for this is that families are getting smaller. The average couple now has only 1. 8 children. At the same time, improved medical care means that people are living longer.\n       This change in the age of Americans is going to have serious results. For one thing, medical costs are rising. The government is unable to pay the elderly people's medical bills that have gone up very much. Some old people have to leave hospital \"sicker and quicker\" than they should, before they are really better.\n       More fortunate senior citizens, though, who still have good health, want new laws to be passed to allow them to stay at work. In the past, the retirement age was sixty-five, but that is changing now. Older people are stronger and more energetic than ever before. Many of them refuse to stop working just because they have reached a certain age.\n       There is a change, too, in the way in which elderly people see themselves.  _ are no longer happy to accept the gray hair, bald heads, and boring clothes of their own parents. They like to wear younger-looking clothes and bright makeup . American women spend millions of dollars a year on operations to lift their faces and make those ugly wrinkles disappear.  Men are prepared to spend even more on operations to plant new hair on their bald spots. It's worth any money to look younger.", "id": "high19066.txt"}
