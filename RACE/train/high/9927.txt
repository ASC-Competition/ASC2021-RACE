In a hurry to dive into the cool water, he ran out of the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks, and shirt as he went. He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator   was swimming toward the shoe. His mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could.\nHearing her voice, the little boy became worried and made a return to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him.\nFrom the bank. the mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator _ his legs. That began a tug-of-war   between the two. The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother was much too determined to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard her screams, raced from his truck, took aim and shot the alligator.\nAfter weeks and weeks in hospital, the little boy survived. His legs were extremely scarred   by the attack of the animal and on his arms were deep scratches where his mother's fingernails dug into his flesh in her effort to hang on to the son she loved.\nThe newspaper reporter, who interviewed the boy after the injury, asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted his pants legs. And then, with obvious pride, he said to the reporter. \"But look at my arms. I have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my mom wouldn't let go.", "id": "high9927.txt"}
