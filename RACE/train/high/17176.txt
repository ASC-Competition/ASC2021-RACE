This modern faith in medicine is proved by the fact that the annual drug bill of the Health Services is increasing to huge figures and shows no signs at present of stopping to rise. The majority of the patients attending the medical out-patients  departments of our hospitals feel that they have not received enough treatment unless they are able to carry home with them some tangible  curative in the shape of a bottle of medicine, a box of pills, or a small jar of ointment , and the doctor in charge of the department is only too ready to provide them with these requirements. There is no quicker method of treating of patients than by giving them what they are asking for, and since most doctors in the Health Services are overworked and have little time for offering time-consuming and little-appreciated advice on such subjects as diet, right living, and the need for abandoning bad habits etc.\nNor is it only the ignorant and ill-educated person who has such faith in the bottle of medicine. It is said that Thomas Carlyle (a famous Scottish writer), when he heard of the illness of his friend, went off immediately to visit him carrying with him in his pocket what remained of a bottle of medicine formerly used for a slight illness of Mrs. Carlyle's. Carlyle was entirely ignorant of what the bottle in his pocket contained or the nature of the illness from which his friend was suffering, but a medicine that had worked so well in one form of illness would surely be of equal benefit in another, and comforted by the thought of the help he was bringing to his friend, he rushed to Henry Taylor's house. History does not relate whether his friend accepted his medical help, but probably he did.", "id": "high17176.txt"}
