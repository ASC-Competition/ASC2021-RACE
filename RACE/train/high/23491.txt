The new sweetened chocolate drink was so expensive that few could afford,but by the 17th century the drink was common among European noblemen. In England,which was somewhat more equalityfavored than the rest of Europe,chocolate was more widely available. Those who could afford it could enjoy chocolate drinks in the new coffee and chocolate houses of London.\nAs cacao tree became more commonly available,people began experimenting with new ways of using it. Chocolate began to appear in cakes and other foods. But it wasn't until 1828 that the \"modern ear\" of chocolate making and production began.\nThe introduction of cocoa powder not only made creating chocolate drinks much easier,but also made it possible to combine chocolate with sugar and then remix it with cocoa butter to create a solid. Others began to build on Van Houten's success,experimenting to make new chocolate products. In 1849,English chocolate maker Joseph Storrs Fry produced what was the world's first eating chocolate.\nToday,the Swiss are famous for their chocolate,and rightly so. In the late 19th century,they developed a number of processes that contributed greatly to creating the solid chocolate candy that we all enjoy today. Two major developments occurred in 1879.First,Daniel Peter,a Swiss chocolate producer,had the idea of using powdered milk (invented by Swiss Chemist Henri Nestle in 1867) to make a new kind of chocolate,milk chocolate. Second,Rudolph Lindt invented a process called \"conching\",which greatly improved the quality of chocolate candy by making it more mixable.", "id": "high23491.txt"}
