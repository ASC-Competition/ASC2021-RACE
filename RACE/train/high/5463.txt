Your house and possession are valuable and must be properly protected. When you buy a lock, you buy time --- and this is the one thing a burglar can't afford. Most thieves are casual opportunists to whom the best deterrents  are delay and noise which could mean discovery.\nWhen you leave it, lock it!\nFirst of all, fit security locks to all doors and windows and a safety chain on the front door. Secondly, use them! If you have any ladders or tools, don't leave them lying about in the garden, lock them away. \"Safe\" or \"secret\" places for keys and valuables are not reliable - nine times out of ten, they are the first place a thief will look.\nWhen you move house...\nWhen you move into a new home even if it is fitted with security locks, change them. You don't know who else may have keys.\nNever let strangers into your house. An official - looking cap is not enough, ask for proof of identity and look at it carefully - if you are still not satisfied, don't let the person in.\nValuables need special protection\nValuables should really be given special protection - preferably by leaving them with your bank. A small security safe works too, but not to the most determined burglar. It is also important to keep an up - to - date list of valuables and their descriptions. In the case of fine art, paintings, or jewelry, color photographs can sometimes be of assistance to the police if you are unfortunate enough to have them stolen. Enter the details on the back of the pictures. But don't keep such documents in your house, keep them at the hank or with your insurance company.\nGoing on holiday?\nDon't talk about your holidays and future plans loudly in public. Do remember to cancel the milk and newspapers and also to draw curtains back.\nOperate a \"Good Neighbor\" program to ensure that mail is taken in, the house is checked regularly and that lights are put on.\nCall at your local police station and tell them you are going away. Make sure that they know how to contact you in case of trouble.\nDon't leave cash or valuables in the house--take them with you or put them in the bank.", "id": "high5463.txt"}
