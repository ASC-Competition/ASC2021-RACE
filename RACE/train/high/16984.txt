It is also referred to as IP Telephony. It is another way of making phone calls, though the 'phone' part is not always present any more, as you can communicate without a telephone set. VOIP is especially popular with long distance calls. The main reason for which people are so massively turning to VOIP technology is the cost. VOIP is said to be cheap, but most people use it for free. Yes, if you have a computer with a microphone and speakers, and a good Internet connection, you can communicate using VOIP for free.\nThere are basically three ways of using VOIP. One is to have a PC on both communicating sides; another is to have a phone on one side and a PC on the other and the third is to have two phones. \nVOIP is a  ly new technology and it has already achieved wide acceptance and use. There is still a lot to improve and it is expected to have major technological advances in VOIP in the future. It has so far proved to be a good candidate for replacing the POTS (Plain Old Telephone System). It, of course, has drawbacks along with the numerous advantages it brings; and its increasing use worldwide is creating new considerations surrounding its regulations and security.                         \nThe growth of VOIP today can be compared to that of the Internet in the early 90's. The public is getting more and more conscious of the advantages they can get from VOIP at home or in their businesses. Advertising campaigns, which are present everywhere on the net, are contributing a lot towards the popularization of VOIP which not only gives facilities and allows people to save, but also producing huge income for those who dived early into the new phenomenon.", "id": "high16984.txt"}
