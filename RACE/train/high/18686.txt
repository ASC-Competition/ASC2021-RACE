He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work.One day he was walking along the shore.As he looked down at the beach,he saw a human figure moving like a dancer.He smiled to himself at the thought that someone would dance on the beach.So he began to walk faster to catch up.As he got closer, he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing,\nbut instead he was reaching down to the shore,picking up something and very gently throwing it into the ocean.As he got closer, he called out,\"Good morning! What are you doing?\" The young man paused,looked up and replied,\"Throwing starfishes in the ocean.\"\n      \"I guess I should have asked,why are you throwing starfishes in the ocean?\"\n      \"The sun is up and the tide is going out,And if I don't throw them in,they'll die.\"\n      \"But, young man,don't you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfishes all\n along it.You can't possibly make a difference!\"   \n      The young man listened politely.Then he bent down,picked another starfish and threw it  into the sea,and said,\"It made a difference to that one.\"There is something very special in each and every one of us.We have all been gifted with the ability to make a difference.And if we can know that gift,we will gain through the strength of our vision the power to shape the future.\n    We must each find our starfish.And if we throw our starfish wisely and well,the world will be better.", "id": "high18686.txt"}
