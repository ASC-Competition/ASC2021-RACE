A group of timechallenged Canadian women are wishing for a 25hour clock.\nJessie Behan, president of the 25th Hour Coalition  which is a group of Canadian women who have changed to a longer day, said the struggle for women to maintain worklife balance motivated   her to research the body's natural clock.\"Many of my girlfriends are having kids,getting married, and I see the sufferings of dealing all that when you're a working woman,\"she said.\"Women like myself are sick of living their lives by a 24hour clock.\"\nA 2007 study by Charles Czeisler found a switch to longer days could be beneficial, especially for frequent travelers, shift workers, astronauts and those who experience trouble sleeping or waking.\nIn a similar study, Czeisler showed the body's natural clock averages 24 hours and 11 minutes in both young and older people.The current 360degree clock has 720 minutes, giving each minute 0.5 degree.With the new 25hour day, 30 minutes is added to each 12hour period making each minute 0.48 degree.\nWhile still a relatively small movement-the 25th Hour Coalition has 160 Facebook members, Behan is hoping for large changes.\"The goal is to get as many women on board; there's no harm in just trying it out and seeing.If it gets big, maybe the government will decide to standardize it.\"\nA recent online survey by Reader's Digest, which included 150 people in each of the 13 countries, suggests it's not just Canadians looking for longer days.Readers were asked\"what would you do with an extra hour\"if given a choice between sleep, work, exercise and family time.In Spain, half of respondents  said they'd like an extra hour in the day to devote to family time.The same was found for respondents in Brazil, the US and Britain, who chose family time over sleep, which came in at a close second.Only in India did work top the list with 50 percent of respondents claiming they could use an extra hour at the office.", "id": "high7620.txt"}
