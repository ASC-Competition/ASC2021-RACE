It even has a name -- \"Black Friday.\" The name comes from the idea that this is the day when store owners begin to show a profit for the year.\nIn the past, before calculators and computers, workers recorded the profits and losses of American businesses in special books. They used red ink to record losses. They used black ink to record profits. They used the term \"in the red\" to mean losing money. \"In the black\" meant making a profit. So \"Black Friday\" was the day when the store owners moved from being \"in the red\" to \"in the black.\"\nMany people consider \"Black Friday\" to be the busiest shopping day of the year. But that is probably false. Researchers say it may be the day when the largest number of people go to stores. But it is not necessarily the day when shoppers spend the largest amount of money. Some experts say Americans just want to get out of the house the day after Thanksgiving. And many stores reduce some of their prices on \"Black Friday.\" \nHowever, experts say that many people wait until much closer to Christmas, December 25, hoping to find even lower prices. They say the busiest day of the year in terms of the amount of shoppers and sales is usually the Saturday before Christmas.\nA marketing services company carried out a public opinion study about shopping last month. It asked almost one thousand Americans about their gift buying plans. One-third said they plan to go to stores to shop on the day after Thanksgiving.\nThe study found that these shoppers are mainly young people, probably because older people do not want to deal with huge crowds. In fact, business leaders say many older Americans are doing their shopping at home -- on the computer. They say the day most people shop online is the Monday after \"Black Friday.\" They even have a name for it -- \"Cyber Monday.\"", "id": "high23957.txt"}
