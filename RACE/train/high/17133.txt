He notes however, that although patients have such interest, only up to 2% of doctors in the United States offer e-mail services. \nUsing e-mail, doctors can make sure of their advice and point patients to patients information materials and sources on the Internet. It's said that more than 10.000 health-oriented websites already exist now. \nHowever some people worry that widespread use of medical e-mail might set up two kinds of care--one \"haves\" and another for the \"have-nots\". But Pal points out that \"In the near future nearly every library will offer (Internet and e-mail)services in the United States, \" allowing even low-income patients to use such means. Pal also talks about other possible barriers to acceptance of medical e-mail. \n\"Doctors may be unwilling to offer e-mail services for fear of increasing workload and uncertainty about the time they spent,\" he explained, and patients may worry that their medical information might be read by others. \"But these problems can all be solved,\" he adds. \nE-mail may well help us a lot in health care, Pal concludes. \"Patients want to know more than they can get in normal clinics,\" he points out, \"and they might find communication on the information superhighway less fearful than face-to-face dialogue with their doctors.\"", "id": "high17133.txt"}
