This version of the Manual states that:\n    \"Adult chickens must be sent by Express Mail. The containers used must pass the standards in International Safe Transit Association Test Procedure 1A; be strong enough to endure normal handling; and the number of birds must not be more than the container's limit.\"\n    I mailed the chicken in a wooden box got from a colleague who does research with birds, and mailed the egg in standard packaging obtained through an industrial supplier.\n    I posted both the chicken and the egg at 9:40 am, on a Monday morning, from theHarvard Squarepost office, inCambridge,Massachusetts. The staff there told me that this was the first chicken anyone had mailed from there in recent memory, and perhaps ever.\n    The intended destination for both packages was the James A. Farley General Post Office, which is located inManhattanright next to Penn Station.\n    I took the subway from Harvard Square to the Boston train station, and from there boarded a train to New York City, a distance of about 320 kilometres, arriving that afternoon at Penn Station. I immediately went to the post office, to await the arrivals of the chicken and the egg.\n    The James A. Farley General Post Office is open 24 hours a day, so I was able to wait there until both items arrived.\n    That day, Monday, neither the chicken nor the egg arrived. The next day, Tuesday, neither the chicken nor the egg arrived.\n    The chicken arrived at 10:31 am, Wednesday. The staff at the post office told me that this was the first chicken anyone had mailed to the post office in recent memory, and perhaps ever. The egg arrived that same day, at 9:37 pm, 11 hours after the chicken.\n    So, it's now quite clear that the chicken came first, the egg second.", "id": "high24021.txt"}
