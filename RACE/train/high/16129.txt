The exam will be held next Thursday, the last day of the exam week. Remember to bring two or three pens in case they run out of ink. Unlike the midterm exam, this test will not include multiple-choice  questions, it will contain entirely of essays . You will have to answer three of the five essay questions. The exam will be comprehensive , which means you will have to go over all of the subject matters we learnt in class this term. I would suggest you review your midterm exam as well as textbooks and your class notes. The research project will count as 20% and the midterm exam 30%. I will be in my office almost all day next Tuesday. If you run into any problems, please drop in. Good luck to you and I will see you on Tuesday.", "id": "high16129.txt"}
