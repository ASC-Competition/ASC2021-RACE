Some people spendall their lives trying to forget bad experiences. Violence and traffic accidents can leave people with terrible physical and emotional scars. Often they relive these experiences in nightmares.\nNow American researchers think they are close to developing a pill, which will help people forget bad memories.

The drug stops the body releasing chemicals that fix memories in the brain. So far the research has suggested that only the emotional effects of memories may be reduced, not that the memories are erased.\nThe research has caused a great deal of argument.

They also help us all avoid the mistakes of the past.\n\"All of us can think of bad events in our lives that were horrible at the time but make us who we are. I'm not sure we want to wipe those memories out,\" said Rebecca Dresser, a medical ethicist", "id": "high16970.txt"}
