When no one is around, I practise singing songs like crazy. \"\nXiaomei's 3G cellphone almost made her a super star among her classmates. 3G was first introduced into Japan in 2001.  After a slow start,  it's now widely used there.  High school students top the list of user groups, according to a major service provider in Japan. \n     After years of effort, China is finally catching up. In January, China issued a 3G license to three operators--China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom. In 2009, the operators announced plans to expand the use of 3G cellphones.\nWhat is 3G?\n3G wireless networks give users faster Internet connections. The Internet connection speed of 3G can be up to 15 to 20 times faster.  This allows music and games to be downloaded more easily. E-mail can also be accessed  faster.  It has made watching movies and video-conferencing possible on a mobile phone. \nHow do I use 3G?\n   First, you must have a 3G cellphone. This year, products made by different cellphone companies will gradually  appear in the marketplace. \nChina Mobile and China Telecom users can continue using their old phone number and SIM card.  China Unicom, however, has not yet decided on this matter. \nHow much does it cost?\n   The three operators have said that 3G fees will be similar,  or slightly lower than today's 2G cellphones. \n   According to a 3G student package,  calls within the China Mobile network will cost 0.13 yuan per minute,  while the fees go up to 0.23yuan per minute for calls between China Mobile and other networks.", "id": "high21807.txt"}
