The old man's beard was glazed by winter's frost while he waited for a ride across the river. The wait seemed endless. His body became numb and stiff from the frigid north wind.\nIt was long before he heard the faint, steady rhythm of hooves   along the frozen path. Anxiously watching several horsemen coming up, he let the first one pass by without any effort to get his attention, then another passed by, and another. Finally, the last rider drew near where the old man sat like a snow statue when old man caught his eyes and said, \"Sir, would you mind giving an old man a ride to the other side?\"\nStopping his horse, the rider replied, \"Sure! Jump aboard.\" Seeing the old man unable to lift his half-frozen body from the ground, the horseman got down to help him. The horseman took him not just across the river, but to his destination just a few miles away.\nAs they approached the tiny but cozy cottage, the horseman's curiosity caused him to inquire, \"Sir, I noticed you let several other riders pass by without making an effort to secure a ride. Then I came up and you immediately asked me for a ride. I am curious why, on such a bitter night, you would wait and ask the last rider. What if I had refused and left you here?\"\nThe old man looked the rider straight in the eyes and replied, \"I reckon I know people pretty good. I looked into the eyes of the other riders and immediately found no concern for my situation. It would have been useless even to ask them for a ride. But when I looked into your eyes, your gentle spirit would welcome the opportunity to give me assistance in my time of need.\"\nThose heart-warming comments touched the horseman deeply. \"I'm so grateful for what you have said,\" he told the old man. \"May I never get too busy in my own affairs that I fail to respond to the needs of others with kindness and compassion.\"\nWith that, Thomas Jefferson turned his horse around and made his way back to the White House.", "id": "high8949.txt"}
