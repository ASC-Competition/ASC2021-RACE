The council says  the tax will raise as much as PS100 million over ten years--one fifth of the cost of a new transport system for the city.\nAnother transport spokesman Theresa Villiers said the tax  would have a devastating impact on businesses struggling to  cope with the economic decline.\nBut Richard Hebditch of the Campaign for Better Transport  said the tax would raise money to invest in better transport.\"We put forward the idea of workplace parking taxes as a fairer way to raise money to invest in the future local transport services.We are pleased that the people of Nottingham will be the first to benefit.\"", "id": "high7553.txt"}
