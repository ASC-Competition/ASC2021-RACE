While trying to control the ship and avoid sinking, he started feeling annoyed. The water became bigger; the noise of the water hitting the boat, like a feather carried by the wind, almost led him to hopelessness. But he did not give up and tried harder every time the waves hit the boat. In his desperate attempts to stay strong and keep the boat steady, he was unable to hear one of his crew officers yelling at him.\n\"Captain, Captain!\" kept yelling the officer. He held on to one of the deck's bars in order not to fall off the boat, \"Captain, Captain!\" insisted the officer.\nThis time, while the officer was trying to approach him, a huge wave almost made the boat turn over and he fell and rolled on the deck till he luckily found another bar to hold on to. After several attempts, the officer finally was able to reach his fighting and tired captain, who had started to yell out his frustration and thoughts to the angry waves.\n\"If I am a good and hard-working man, why does this happen to me? And why can't I get out of this one? I have been sailing the open ocean for years to fish the best catch and get support for my family!! Why, why, why?!!!\"\nAt that moment, his crew officer was able to catch the captain's shoulder and make him turn so that the captain could hear him.\n\"Captain, Captain!\" yelled again the officer.\nThe captain looked at him angrily because the officer distracted him from his difficult task.\n\"What do you need, officer? Don't you see I am trying to control the ship and find our way back?\" complained the captain.\nHis officer kept holding on to the captain and pointed at the opposite direction, towards the stern  . \n\"Captain!\" he replied. \"The lighthouse is right over there, on the other side. We are going in the wrong direction!!\"", "id": "high18042.txt"}
