We met at an Apple product announcement. She was helpful, smart, and even funny, talking of jokes and making me laugh. What more could a man ask for?\nSince then, we have had some major communication issues. She frequently misunderstands what I'm saying. Sometimes she is just unavailable. Often, she responds with the same repetitive statement. Her name is Siri. \nAt first, Siri, the voice-activated digital assistant on Apple Iphones, seemed a little too good to be true. Siri cheated me into a relationship promising to help me set up appointments, to gently wake me in the morning for work, and to give me the ability to text someone while I was driving. \nIt didn't work out that way. \"There's something wrong, and I can't answer your questions right now. Please try again in a little while,\" Siri will say when I ask something, or: \"I'm really sorry about this, but I can't take any requests right now. Please try again in a little while.\" She is always polite. But I'm starting to suspect that \"I'm really sorry\" is just something Siri says to shut me up.\nApple introduced Siri as a beta test, meaning it was still a work in progress. That was unusual for Apple. It wanted a head start. But it doesn't seem ready to change anything yet. Many people I have spoken to have switched Siri off and turned to the iPhone's voice dictation service, which is more reliable because it doesn't use Siri's artificial intelligence software. \nOver time, things have really gone bad between Siri and me. We hardly speak anymore. Although she doesn't know this, I've started seeing someone else. Her name is Google Voice Search (GVS). GVS, available in the latest operating software, is a much better listener. It's  ly smarter. If I ask GVS a question, like, \"Who is Tim Cook?\", it responds with an answer \" He's the chief executive of Apple\". If I ask Siri the same question, the response is: \"I don't see Tim Cook in your contacts.\"", "id": "high17445.txt"}
