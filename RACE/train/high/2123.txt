From \"Easy Street\" (1917) to \"Modern Times\" (1936), he made many of the funniest and most popular films of his time. He was best known for his character, the naive and lovable Little Tramp. The Little Tramp, a well meaning man in a raggedy suit with cane, always found himself wobbling into awkward situations and strangely wobbling away. More than any other figure, it is this kind-hearted character that we associate with the time before the talkies (sound films).\nBorn in London in 1889, Chaplin first visited America with a theater company in 1907. Appearing as \"Billy\" in the play \"Sherlock Holmes\", the young Chaplin toured the country twice. On his second tour, he met Mack Sennett and was signed to Keystone Studios to act in films. In 1914 Chaplin made his first one-reeler, \"Making a Living\". That same year he made thirty-four more short films, including \"Caught in a Cabaret\", \"Caught in the Rain\", \"The Face on the Bar-Room Floor\", and \"His Trysting Place\". These early silent shorts allowed very little time for anything but physical comedy, and Chaplin was a master at it.\nThough Chaplin is of the silent movie era, we see his achievements carried through in the films of today. With the appearance of the feature-length talkies, the need for more subtle acting became apparent. To maintain the audience's attention throughout a six-reel film, an actor needed to move beyond constant comedy. Chaplin had demanded this depth long before anyone else. His strictness and concern for the processes of acting and directing made his films great and led the way to a new, more sophisticated, cinema.", "id": "high2123.txt"}
