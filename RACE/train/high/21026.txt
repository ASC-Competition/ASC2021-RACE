In fact, the scientific opinion is that it cannot be differentiated in any way from food normally bred animals. The issue is animal welfare,\" EU Health and Consumer Commissioner John Dalli told reporters.\nFood derived from the offspring of clones presents no such animal welfare issues, and banning its sale and import would be impossible because the origin is untraceable, Dalli said.\n\"Such a prohibition would lead to a ban of imports of any food of animal origin (meat, milk and processed products)from third countries allowing the cloning technique,\" the report said.\n\"We're not going to regulate for the world,\" Dalli added.\nBut animal welfare groups criticized the Commission's decision, saying it had bowed to pressure from third countries.\n\"We do not accept the Commission's position that it would be impossible to enforce a ban that includes the offspring of cloned animals, as (other) meat traceability systems are already in place,\" said Sonja Van Tichelen, director of the Eurogroup for Animals.", "id": "high21026.txt"}
