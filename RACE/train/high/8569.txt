Halloween was referred to as All Hallows Eve and dates back to over 2000 years ago.\nThe American tradition of \"trick-or-treating\" probably dates back to the early All Souls' Day marches in England. During the festivities, poor citizens would beg for food and families would give them pastries called \"soul cakes\" in return for their promise to pray for the family's dead relatives.\nThe act of giving out soul cakes was encouraged by the church as a way to replace the ancient practice of leaving food and wine for homeless ghosts. The practice, which was referred to as \"going a-souling\" was finally taken up by children who would visit the houses in their neighborhood and be given sweets, food, and money.\nThe tradition of dressing in costume  for Halloween has both European and Celtic roots.
