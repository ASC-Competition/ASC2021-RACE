But being at home didn't keep them safe, since few buildings remained standing once they were hit by wind as violent as 376 kilometers per hour, according to NBC News.\n\"This is at the top end of any tropical system that we've seen on our planet,\" said Bryan Norcross, a weather scientist working for NBC. And so far, Haiyan has caused more than 3,600 deaths and left millions of people homeless.\n.But where did Haiyan get its destructive power?\nAccording to Brian McNoldy, a tropical weather expert at the University of Miami, US, Haiyan was so strong because \"it had everything working for it\"\n\"All typhoons feed off the warm ocean waters,\" Colin Price, a weather researcher at Tel Aviv University in Israel, told National Geographic. Tropical storms are like giant engines ,powered by the heat transferred from the ocean waters to the air above. However, because of climate change, the oceans have been warming up in recent decades. \"Warmer oceans will result in more intense storms,\" Price said.\nAlso, Haiyan started near the equator ,where it was able to pick up more heat before heading to the Philippines. Moreover, the route it traveled was mostly along open ocean, which means no land prevented it from gathering steam .\nIn addition, there happened to be very little \"wind shear in the area this time. Wind shear is a sudden change in wind speed or direction, which can tear apart developing storms. This is like when you stir  a glass of water with a chopstick: a swirl will form, 'but if you move the chopstick in the opposite direction, the swirl will quickly disappear.\"\n\"When all those things _ in a certain way, you're going to get something like'Haiyan'.\"Jim Kossin, a scientist with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told National Geographic.", "id": "high5519.txt"}
