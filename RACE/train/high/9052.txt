Nadia would not reply to anything Kate said. Kate was in charge of showing Nadia around on her first day at Buck Minister Grade School. Kate could not figure out why the school had put Nadia in a class where she could not understand what people were saying.\n\"Why did they do this?\" Kate wondered aloud. \"I mean, you can't learn if you can't understand the teacher.\"\nNadia's voice was a whisper (speaking in a very low voice). \"I understand English. I will learn.\" Nadia's English was perfect.\nKate was _ . She couldn't understand why Nadia did not like to speak. Then she realized that moving to a new country probably wasn't the easiest thing to do. There were hundreds of unfamiliar and unusual things to learn - all at the same time.\n\"There're a lot of new things to learn, huh?\" said Kate.\nNadia nodded rapidly. In a quiet voice she replied, \"Many things people say, I do not understand. I have been speaking English and Romanian all my life, but I do not know what some children are saying. For example, yesterday a boy asked if I could help him find the USB port on a thin black box he was carrying. Isn't a port a place for ships? It made no sense to me.\"\n\"Don't worry.\" said Kate. \"You'll figure everything out in time. You see, that thin black box was a computer. A USB port is a place where you can connect other machines to a computer.\"\nNadia and Kate were quiet after that. They took notes while the teacher gave a maths lesson. To Kate's surprise, Nadia put up her hand and offered to answer the questions at the blackboard.\nNadia handled every question the teacher gave her. Some of the questions were really difficult, and no one understood what was going on except Nadia and the teacher. When the teacher said that Nadia answered everything correctly, the whole class clapped their hands.\nNadia was smiling when she sat back down next to Kate. \"Some things,\" she said in a normal voice, \"are the same all over the world.\"", "id": "high9052.txt"}
