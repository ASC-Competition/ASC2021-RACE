Think of the times when you were attracted to a super novel or the times when you were playing your guitar or piano. But at other times your mind races from one thing to another. Here are some tips.\nRest from time to time. Remember to take short breaks. Lectures are usually 50 minutes long, and that's about the length of time most people can direct their attention to one task. But that's just an average. Your concentration time might be shorter (20-35 minutes) or longer (perhaps 90 minutes).When you take a break, you get more oxygen to your brain! When we sit for long periods, blood tends to be pooled in our lower body and legs. Get up and walk around the room for a couple of minutes. As a result, more oxygen is carried to the brain and you can concentrate better.\n _ If you study one subject for a long time, you may find it hard to concentrate. Many students improve their concentration by changing one subject to another every one to two hours. In this way you can pay more attention to something that's different.\nReward yourself. Give yourself a reward when you've completed a task. The task might be small, such as staying with a difficult paper until you've finished. But giving yourself a reward can help you be more interested in doing other tasks.\nIncrease your activity level. Your concentration wanders more easily if you just read an article straight through. Instead, take the heading for each part and turn it into a question. For this part, that would be, \"How can I increase my activity level while studying?\" Then study that part to answer that question. Do this routinely. The questions give us a focus for each part and increase our involvement .", "id": "high6744.txt"}
