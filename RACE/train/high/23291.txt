The problem with cell phones seems to be they are allowing for ever more spillover between work and home.\nThis may be especially true for working women, the study found.Among men, consistent use of mobile phones seemed not to allow more work issues to creep  into family time.But for women,  the spillover tended to go in both directions - being \"connected\" means that work cuts into home time, and family issues come into work life.\nCell phones seem to be opening more lines for stressful exchange among family members.But there may be ways to control the spillover,  according to Chesley.
