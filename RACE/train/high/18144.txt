But there are a few people who will get into their cars and go straight for the center of the storm. These people are willing to risk being killed by floods or 100-kilometer-an-hour winds for the excitement of watching the storm close up.\n  \"Storm chasing \" is becoming an increasing popular hobby, especially in the Midwest of the United States, where there are frequent storms between March and July. A storm chaser begins the day by checking the Internet for the latest weather report, and then drives up to 1000 kilometers to where the storm will be and waits for it to develop.\n  Although anyone can do it, storm chasing is extremely dangerous. The power of a big storm can throw a cow into the air or destroy a whole house in seconds. Storm chasers are also often hurt in accidents caused by driving in a heavy rain. If you are a beginner, it is much safer to join a group for storm-chasing vacations during the storm season.\n  Even then, storm chasing is not all adventure and excitement. \"Storm chasing is 95% driving,\" says Daniel Lynch, who spends most of his summer storm-chasing. \"Sometimes you can sit around for hours waiting for something to happen, and all you get is blue sky and a few light showers.\"\n  However, for storm chasers, it is all worth it. \"When you get close to a storm, it is the most exciting sight you will ever see in your life,\" says Jasper Morley. \"Every storm is an example of the power of nature. It is the greatest show on earth.\"", "id": "high18144.txt"}
