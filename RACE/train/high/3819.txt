They did not have many friends there, but they soon met a lot of interesting people, and after a few weeks, they often went to dinner or to parties at other people's houses.\nThen Mrs. Harris said to her husband, \"We've been to a lot of other people's houses, and now we must invite them to our house, mustn't we?\"\n\"Yes, certainly,\" answered her husband, \"A big party will be the easiest thing, won't it? Then we can start to invite people to dinner in small numbers next month.\"\nSo Mrs. Harris said, \"Yes, I'll invite all our friends here to a big party on 5th December.\"\n\"How many will that be?\" Mr. Harris asked. \"Don't invite too many.\"\nMrs. Harris was beginning to write the invitations when her husband saw that she was writing, \"Party. 6.30 to 8.30 p.m.\"\n\"That isn't very nice, is it?\" he said. \"You're telling our guests that they must go at 8.30.\" So Mrs. Harris just wrote \"Party. 6.30 p.m.\"\nA lot of guests came, and they all had a good time, so they did not go home at 8.30. In fact they were still there at mid-night when the door bell rang and a policeman arrived. He said, \"You must stop making a noise, because someone has complained.\"\nMr. Harris said he did not want to quarrel with the policeman, so everyone went home. They were sorry to have to go.\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Harris were alone again, she said to him. \"That was a surprise, wasn't it? Who complained about the noise?\"\n\"I did,\" Mr Harris answered in a tired voice.", "id": "high3819.txt"}
