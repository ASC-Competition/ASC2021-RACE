They thought they would adopt a baby girl. After waiting one and a half years, the social worker asked them to consider adopting a six-year-old boy named Jerry.\nAfter the adoption papers were signed, Amy asked if Jerry had a good friend at the orphanage. Jerry said his best friend was Zack. That was the first time that Amy heard about Zack.\nThen Jerry went to his new home with Amy and Mark, where he lived happily and adjusted very well. However, Jerry kept talking about his best friend that he had left behind at the orphanage. So Amy became determined to try and find out more about Zack.\nShe came across a database specifically for families who had adopted children from the orphanage where she met Jerry. The database allowed parents to enter their child's name and his or her adoption information. As Amy looked through the database, she found what appeared to be a possible match of her son's best friend. After sending a new e-mails back and forth, Amy was sure to have the right Zack. He had adopted by Rae and Bruce Hostetler two weeks before. To her surprise, the two families were living in the same city. Then she decided to give these two friends a special reunion  \nOn a sunny Sunday, the two boys finally met each other again. When Jerry asked Zack, \"Do you remember me?\" Zack quickly answered, \"Yes! Let's go and play!\" That led to hours of laughter and play. Rae and Amy were excited to see how well their sons got along, and what an amazing bond  they had. Thanks to both families, that special bond between Zack and Jerry can continue for the rest of their lives.", "id": "high15638.txt"}
