With head tilted, and shoulders bent forward he leaned on his trusty stick with each unhurried step. His torn cloth jacket, patched trousers, worn out shoes, and warm personality made him stand out from the usual Saturday morning breakfast crowd. He stopped, turned with his whole body, and winked at a little girl seated by the door. She flashed a big smile right back at him.\nA young waitress named Mary watched him walk toward a table by the window. She ran over to him, and said, \"Here, Sir. Let me give you a hand with that chair.\" She pulled the chair away from the table. Steadying him with one arm, she helped him move in front of the chair, and get comfortably seated. Then she moved the table up close to him, and leaned his stick against the table where he could reach it.\nIn a soft, clear voice he said, \"Thank you, Miss. And bless you for your kind gestures.\"\n\"You're welcome, Sir.\" She replied. \"And my name is Mary. I'll be back in a moment, and if you need anything at all in the mean time, just wave at me!\"\nAfter he had finished a hearty meal, Mary brought him the change from his ticket. He left it on the table. She helped him and walked with him to the front door. Holding the door open for him, she said, \"Come back and see us, Sir!\" He turned and nodded a thank-you. \"You are very kind.\" he said softly, smiling.\nWhen Mary went to clean his table, she almost fainted. Under his plate she found a business card, and a note scribbled on a napkin. Under the napkin was a one-hundred-dollar bill.\nThe note on the napkin read, \"Dear Mary, I respect you very much, and you respect yourself too. It shows by the way you treat others. You have found the secret of happiness. Your kind gestures will shine through those who meet you.\"\nThe man she had waited on was the owner of the restaurant where she worked. This was the first time that she, or any of his employees had ever seen him in person.", "id": "high1593.txt"}
