My good friend is Diana. She is a rich and proud girl. She often thinks that she is too good for anyone, so nobody wants to be her friend.\nOne day after school, I was waiting for Diana when Vivien came up to me. She gave me a biscuit. I accepted it. We talked and joked, and from then on, I began to spend more time with Vivien than with Diana. I felt a little uneasy.\nAfter a few days, I went to see Diana with some snacks when Vinien came and sat with me. She offered me a sandwich. She also offered one to Diana, but Diana refused it. She walked away. I was angry with Diana for being so rude .\n\"Never mind.\" Vivien said, \"I'm used to it.\"\nAfter school, I tried to catch up with Diana. While walking home, I tried to correct her attitude , but she didn't listen to me. She said, \"Go and join your dear Vivien. I know you make a new friend and forget the old one.\"\nFor the next few weeks, we didn't talk to each other. Then one day, Diana came to Vivien and me, saying, \"I'm really sorry about what I did. Would you please forgive me?\" Vivien and I looked at each other and smiled. From then on, Diana, Vivien and I have been best friends.", "id": "high8427.txt"}
