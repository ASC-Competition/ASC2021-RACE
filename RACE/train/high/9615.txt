Among them, cardiovascular disease has bothered more people than any other kind of chronic disease.\nAccording to the WHO(World Health Organization), salt consumption , one of the key causes of high blood pressure that can lead to cardiovascular disease, is much higher in China than in other countries.\nDouglas Bettcher, the director of the WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative, says, \"The average Chinese person consumes about 12 to 14 grams (of salt) per day, while the suggestion of the WHO is consumption of less than 5 grams per day. High salt consumption is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and high pressure in China.\nChanging the way that food is prepared could reduce salt consumption in China.\nAnother major risk factor in China is smoking. Dr Michael O'Leary, a representative of the WHO, says, \"We know already that one million deaths in China are related to smoking, This is an enormous number. It means that we are seeing nearly 3000 deaths a day in China, or two deaths every minute, related to smoking.\nAccording to O'Leary, about 26 percent of men who die from smoking-related diseases in China die before the age of 60. People who can still contribute a great deal, in other words, are dying too young.\nChina has tried to ban smoking , but more efforts are needed.\nMore than half of chronic diseases are preventable by changing lifestyles and reducing risks. The four key risk factors are: smoking, diets high in fats, salt and sugar, environments that prevent physical activities, and alcohol consumption. These are the areas on which efforts to make changes need to concentrate.", "id": "high9615.txt"}
