China Eastern Airlines, already an Airbus customer, is said to be targeted, while executives made it plain that they wanted to fight for the Japanese market, which had traditionally been controlled by Boeing.\nOver the next 20 years, Airbus hopes to sell 750 of the new planes into a market worth PS185billion (US$330bn).The company already has129 firm orders for the A380, with 52 options.", "id": "high7688.txt"}
