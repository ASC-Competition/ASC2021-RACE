One evening, a few weeks before Christmas, they showed The Christmas Storyand had a raffle  with a girl's bike as the prize. It was attractive with color1ed streamers , flowers' butterflies, a fascinating bell, all designed to delight a five-year-old girl. But I, who was fifty, won it! This led to a bit of a puzzle as 1 didn't have kids or grandchildren to give it to. I wanted the bike to go to someone who didn't have the opportunity to own such a wonderful thing. I contacted the shelter (where I occasionally volunteered in the kitchen) and while there was a big need for a sweet bike, there was also the potential for it to create conflict.\nI sought else where until I found out about a couple in our church who had been going through hard times in their marriage because of drugs and alcohol. They walked to our church (they didn't have a car) from a parking lot a mile away and they had a sweet little five-year-old daughter.\nOn Christmas Eve I went to their parking lot. They had already left on foot to go to the candle lighting service. Their landlord was on the parking lot and when he heard that 1 wanted to leave the bike anonymously   he offered to open up their trailer  .There I saw a lone tree, so I put the bike behind it.\nIt was a great moment for me and, I hope, a little bit of Christmas magic for the family and that little girl.", "id": "high18183.txt"}
