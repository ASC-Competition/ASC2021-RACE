Or at least in the eyes of Joey, the star of War Horse (<< >> ). The film has come out in cinemas on February 28, 2012 on the Chinese mainland.\nThe story starts on a farm in Devon, southwest England. The Narracott family--Dad, Mum, and their teenage son Albert - rent the farm. When Dad buys a beautiful horse, Albert falls in love with him. He trains him and names him Joey. They become as close as it is possible for a human and an animal to be.\nBut World War I breaks out. Dad has to sell the horse to an English Army officer to pay the rent. Joey and Albert can no longer be together. Albert promises Joey that they'll find each other again one day. Then Albert goes on a journey to search for his friend.\nBut the four years of war are about Joey's journey. He starts as the mount   of the English officer. Then he becomes a German workhorse. He is given to a French teenager and her grandpa. He has to face the tanks on the front line. The story ends in a sunset scene on the battlefield. Albert has become a soldier. The two are reunited.\nBattle scenes are part of the story , but the movie's Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg said that War Horse is not a war movie.\n\"I consider it to be a love between a horse and a young man... It's about the connectivity   that an animal can bring to human characters,\" Spielberg said.\nRoger Moore of the Chicago Tribune said Spielberg manages in the film to \"measure a man by how he acts toward animals\".\nIn one scene, a British soldier and a German soldier join hands to _ Joey.\n\" Men on opposing   sides of war find their shared humanity in their love of animals in War Horse, I appreciated this work.\" Moore concluded.", "id": "high6665.txt"}
