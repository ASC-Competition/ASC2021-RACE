He held up the example of Kipp (Knowledge Is Power Program) schools in the US, which are often based in the poorest communities and open from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, plus Saturdays. \nBut it would be up to schools to decide to offer longer hours, Gove added.\nParents said Saturday classes could become a \"badge of dishonor\" if pupils were forced to go while teachers raised concerns about their workload.\nMargaret Morrissey, of Parents Outloud, said, \"I think the suggestion the government made about one-to-one teaching for these kids would be a more preferable way of improving these children's performance. I'm just not sure whether taking away a child at weekends is actually going to make them cleverer in the week.\"\nThe ATL's general secretary, Mary Bousted, said, \"If we want Saturday schools, then we need more teachers doing the extra hours, not the same teachers working longer.\"", "id": "high21658.txt"}
