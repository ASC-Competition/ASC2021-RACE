A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. He seized me by the chin .\n\"Tell us your name!\" said the man. \"Quick!\"\n\"Pip, sir.\"\n\"Show us where you live,\" said the man. \"Point out the place!\"\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. \n\"You young dog,\" said the man, licking his lips, \"what fat cheeks you ha' got. Darn me if I couldn't eat em, and if I han't half a mind to't!\"\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying.\n\"Now then lookee here!\" said the man. \"Where's your mother?\"\n\"There, sir!\" said I.\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\n\"There, sir!\" I timidly explained, pointed to the tombstone. \"That's my mother.\"\n\"Oh!\" said he, coming back. \"And is that your father alonger your mother?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said I; \"him too; late of this parish .\"", "id": "high23194.txt"}
