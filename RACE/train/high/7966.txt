As usual, I rushed home from work at midday to check on the house. Nothing was _ . By the time I left work at 5p.m., however, the road into our village was flooded. Our house had never been flooded but, as I opened the front door, a wave of waters greeted me. Thank God! The kids weren't with me, because the house was 5 feet deep in water. We lost everything downstairs. And the plaster had to be torn off the wall's ceilings pulled down.\nAt first we tried to push on through. We didn't want to move the children out of home. So we camped upstairs. We put a sheet of plastic across the floor to protect us from the damp. But after three months, we felt very sick, so we move to a wooden house in a park. The house was small, but at first we were all just delighted to be in a new place. Unfortunately, things took longer than expected and we were there for 10 months. The life there was inconvenient. What surprised me most was how much I missed being part of a community . We had lived in a friendly village with good neighbors, and I'd never thought how much I'd miss that.\nAlthough our situation was very bad, it's difficult to feel too sorry for yourself when you look at what's happening elsewhere. I watched a news report about floods in Northern India and thought. \"We didn't have a straw hut that was for Christmas. But I can't wait--I'm going to throw a party for our friends in the village to say thanks for their support. This year, I won't need any gifts--living away from home for months has made me realize how little we actually need or miss all our possessions. Although we are replacing things, there's really no rush--we have our home back. And that's the main thing.", "id": "high7966.txt"}
