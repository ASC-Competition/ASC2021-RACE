A job-hunt with a clear target will surely help you achieve better results than an aimless one.\nSchedule plenty of interviews.\nUse every possible method to get interviews-answering ads, using search firms , getting in touch with companies directly , surfing the Web, and networking( ). Even if a job is not perfect for you, every interview can become one of your positive experiences.\nFollow up\nEven if someone does not hire you ,write them a thank -you note for the interview. Then, some weeks later, send another brief  letter to explain that you still have not found the perfect position and that you will be available to interview again if the original position you applied for--or any other position , for that matter -is open. Do this with every position you interview for, and you may just catch a break!\nMake it your full-time job\nYou can't find a job by looking sporadically( ) . You have to make time for it. If you're unemployed and looking , devote as much time as you would to a full -time job. If you have a job while you're looking, figure out an organized schedule to maximize your searching time.\nNetwork vertically( )\nIn the search stage of your job hunt , talk to people who are on a level above you in your desired industry. They'll have an accurate and deep understanding that people at your level won't have , and will be in a good position to hire you or recommend you to be hired .\nKeep your spirits up\nLooking for a job is one of the toughest things you will ever have to do, keep up your confidence , continue your efforts, and think positively, and eventually you will get a job you want.", "id": "high15681.txt"}
