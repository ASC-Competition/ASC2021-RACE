However, other aspects of memory -- such as general knowledge -- show no signs.\nTests on rats have previously shown that with burgeoning waistlines come poorer performances in memory tests, but the evidence in humans has been mixed.\nFifty people with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging from 18 (healthy) to 51 (very obese) took part in a memory test -- a bit like doing a treasure hunt on your own. They had to \"hide\" objects at different times and on different scenes displayed on a computer screen. They were later asked to recall what they had hidden, when and where. The results showed obese people's scores were 15% lower than thinner people.\nDr. Lucy Cheke, from the University of Cambridge, told the BBC News website, \"The suggestion we're making is that a higher BMI is having some reduction on the vividness of memory, but they're not drawing blanks and having amnesia  . As a matter of fact, if they have a less strong memory of a recent meal, with a less strong impact in the mind, then they may have less ability to regulate how much they eat later on.\" Hunger hormones  play a huge role in how much we eat, but it has already been recognized that our minds have a key role too. \nDr. Cheke concluded, \"It is too early to talk in terms of advice, but we are certainly beginning to observe how obesity causes itself to continue.\"", "id": "high19435.txt"}
