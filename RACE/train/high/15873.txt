Of the 228 readers who answered it ,108 would clone, 111 would not and nine weighed each side without offering an opinion .\nClearly, from readers' response, this is an issue that reaches deeply into both the joy and eventual  sadness of owning a pet. It speaks, as well, to people's widely differing expectations over the developing scientific procedure  \nMost of the readers who favored the idea strongly believed it would produce at least a close copy of the original; many felt the process would actually return an exact copy. Those on the other side, however, held little hope that clone could truly recreate a pet; many simply did not wish to go against the natural law of life and death.\nBoth sides expressed equal love for their animals. More of them owned \"the best dog/cat in the world\". They thought of their pets as their \"best friend\" or \"a member of the family\". They told moving stories of pets' heroism, intelligence and selfless devotion.\nNo wonder the loss is so disturbing---and the cloning so attractive. \"People become very close to their animals, and the loss can be just as hard to bear as when a friend or family member dies,\" says Gary Kowalski, author of goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a Pet. \"For me, cloning feels like an attempt to turn death away...It's understandable. Death is always painful. It's difficult to deal with. It's hard to accept.\"\nBut would cloning reduce the blow? This question seems to be at the heart of this problem.", "id": "high15873.txt"}
