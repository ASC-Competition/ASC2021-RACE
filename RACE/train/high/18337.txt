On January  12,2013, Seattle residents set the Guinness World Record for the biggest snowball fight More than5,800 people showed up to throw snowballs at one another at the Seattle Centre.   \n    It didn't snow in Seattle on that day, but there was snow in a small comer of the city-enough to  make a lot of kids' dreams come true. Trucks carried 34 loads of snow from Snoqualmie Pass, an hour  away in Washington's Cascade mountain range to the Seattle Center It took 162,000 pounds of the white  stuff to build the winter wonderland.\n    The goal! To break the Guinness World Record for the biggest snowball fight The event was also a fundraiser for the Boys and Girls Clubs. Seattle businessman Neil Bergquist took three  months to organize the playful battle. He wanted to raise money for kids by remembering what it was like  to feel like a kid'\n    Although Seattle residents aren't used to snow, they succeeded in getting enough people to come out  and play About 6,000 tickets were sold online. Participants were given bar-coded wristbands  when they arrived The wristbands were scanned as participants entered and left the location, so Guinness  counted the number at all times. There were 130 judges for the official minute-and-a-half snowball fight  Anyone not throwing snowball wasn't counted in the total\n      To raise money for the Clubs, companies paid for space to build snow fonts (     ). A Guinness official confirmed the count of 5,834 people. Seattle beat the previous world record of about 5,400 at a 2010 snowball fight in South Korea\n      \"We had much fun  set a Guinness record, raised some money for kids, and everyone had a chance to act like a 'kid for a day,\" said Bergquist", "id": "high18337.txt"}
