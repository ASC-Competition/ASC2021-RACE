That means it's a slow time for jewelers, and a good time for you to make a purchase. Whether you're out shopping for gold, or silver, here fife a few things you need to know:\nWhat determines price?\nThe purity of the metal is one of the elements that determines the price. Gold purity is indicated with a stamp of 10K, 14K, 18K, or 24K. And different countries have their own standards. For example, for a piece to be considered gold in the US, it must be at least 10K. In Britain and Canada: 9K. In Italy and France: l 8K. Anything over l 8K is really too soft for everyday wear. That's why jewelry stores in the US sell mostly 14K.\nHow much can you expect to pay?\nThat depends on the weight of the metal and the gemstone . So keep that in mind, especially when buying online. To keep yourself from _ , ask yourself the following:\n*How long has the company been around?\n*What is its return policy?\n* Is the jewelry featured on the website visible from all directions?\n* Is the company transparent with the gram weights and the size of the gemstones?\nYellow gold? White? Rose?\nYes, it's confusing, and while this is largely a personal decision, there fife a few things to keep in mind. For starters. white or rose gold costs about l 0% more than yellow gold. If you want the \"look for less\", consider gold. plated jewelry. \"Gold plated\" and \"gold overlay\" mean the same thing and guarantee a thicker layer of finish than \"vermeil\" which is a flash finish that is thinner and less consistent, but more affordable. Buy vermeil finished pieces you want for a season or two just to follow the fashion. For pieces you want to wear for a lifetime, solid gold is best.\nWhat about sterling silver ?\nSterling silver has been. an alternative for white gold during the difficult economy, and while it used to be more popular with just the younger these days it has much more mass appeal. So much so that retailers are now offering fine gemstones with silver--something you used to see only with gold.\nKeep in mind that in the US. the sterling silver standard is 92.5% real silver. Don't buy it if there isn't a \"925\" stamp on it. And keep in mind that the lower price you're paying for silver means more maintenance. To keep silver jewelry from becoming less shiny, consider keeping a piece of chalk in your jewelry box.", "id": "high3967.txt"}
