Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun.\nStep 1: Gear up!\nEven before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear .\nStep 2: Buckle up!\nStrap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight.\nStep 3: Fall down!\nYou probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt?\nPractice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much.\nStep 4: Stop!\nMake sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate.\nThe brake stop:\nRoll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop.\nThe T stop:\nRoll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop.\nAnother way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass.\nStep 5: Roll around!\nFind a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \"No skating\" signs to make sure you can skate there.", "id": "high1562.txt"}
