It has thousands of years of tradition and culture. Different types of people live in India. In the old days the educational institutions   were called \"ashramam\" and teachers were \"gurus\". A guru was a respected person in society. \nNow we are living in the technological world. Big changes are occurring in people's living. The influence of television, telephone, radio, computer, Internet and mobile phones is very strong in everyday life. But even today, teachers are role models for students. Teaching is still a respectable job. But there are great changes in the education system.\nOne of the most obvious changes is that the influence of Western culture has increased. We are paying too much attention to doing business, just like the Western world. Teachers are likely to to be influenced by this too, but it is not good. Teachers are nation builders. The development of any country depends upon its education system. All types of development are possible through education.\nAnother change has happened in the curriculum  . The curriculum connects the teacher and the student. While education is about learning, curriculum means the situations in which one learns.

But at the moment, it is hard to say whether the curriculum is playing such a role.", "id": "high22235.txt"}
