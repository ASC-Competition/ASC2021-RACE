The place is so small that it can't be found in the map of the county of Shanglin. However, the place has strongly interested experts  both at home and abroad.\nThere are altogether 81 families in the village with more than 540 people. Among them as many as 156 villagers have a university education. Take this year's college entrance examination for example. Six out of nine students from the village who took the examination were taken into universities.\nGoing to school has been a great thing for the whole village. To encourage children to study hard and become useful people, the village has set up a special group made up of four old villagers. Every day, the four villagers go round the village. If they find any child who is not going to school, the child's parents will be punished .\nWhen university students come back to the village for the Spring Festival,the old villagers of the special group always ask them to make up test papers and let the children take the special \"Village Test\". Those who are taken into university can receive money from the village's education fund. The whole village also helps the poor families send their children to school.", "id": "high1879.txt"}
