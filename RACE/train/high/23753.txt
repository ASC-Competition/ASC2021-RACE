David Cameron, the present Prime Minister, said she had been a \"great Briton\" while US President Obama called her a \"great champion of freedom and liberty\". Her funeral is expected to be held next week. Thatcher, Britain's first female premier, was in power from 1979 to 1990 and won three successive general elections. She died \"peacefully\" after suffering a stroke on April 8th 2013. She will not have a state funeral but will be accorded the same status as Princess Diana and the Queen Mother. The Union Jack above Number 10 Downing Street has been lowered to half-mast to pay tributes.\n\"In an era in which politicians are all too often greeted with indifference, it is easy to forget that Britain was once led by a woman who inspired passion.\" says Nick Robinson, a well-known BBC political editor. \nAfter cutting short a trip to Europe to return to London, Cameron described Thatcher as \"the patriot prime minister\" and \"greatest peacetime\" leader. While acknowledging that she had \"divided opinion\", Cameron said she had \"taken a country that was on its knees and made it stand tall again.\" \"Thatcher loved this country and served it with all she had,\" he added. Her other successors in No 10--- Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown --- paid tribute to her strength of character and political purpose while Labour leader Ed Miliband said Thatcher had been a \"unique figure\" who \"reshaped the politics of a whole generation.\"\nBut critics and her opponents questioned the economic and social impact of her policies, ex-Labour leader Lord Kinnock saying her economic policies had been a \"disaster for Britain\" at the time. Among international reaction, Obama said \"America has lost a true friend\" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would \"never forget her part in overcoming the division of Europe\".\nNick Robinson said Thatcher, who had suffered poor health for several years, would always be a divisive politician but one who inspired \"passion\" among her critics and supporters.\nShe was in power when the UK won a war following Argentina's invasion of the Falkland Islands in 1982,but during her later years in office, she was increasingly at odds with other senior figures in the Conservative Party.", "id": "high23753.txt"}
