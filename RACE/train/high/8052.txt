On seeing those in rags on the corner, I only wanted the light to turn green fast enough so that I wouldn't have to keep pretending not to see them.\nThen, one day, as I was holding the hand of my best friend Jane who was young but dying of breast cancer, she told me that she made every moment count by slowing down and by seeing everything .

I can be a slow learner.\nI started by seeing everything, and focused on their presence. One day I saw a Vietnam veteran . I asked him what would make his day.\n\"A hot cup of coffee,\" he told me.\nI bought him a cup of coffee, a stack of pancakes, some eggs, and so on. After our meal together, I asked him if there was anything else that would make his life a bit easier.\n\"A new pair of socks, \"he said.\nSocks, really?

Now I always have an extra pair with me in my car. They are always my best pair, just waiting to be given away.", "id": "high8052.txt"}
