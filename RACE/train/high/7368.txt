Few people could avoid getting caught up in his feelings.\nThis is the appeal of country music, which speaks to the basic emotions of human life. Throughout the 20th century, it has grown into one of the most original and lasting American musical forms.\nCountry music's roots are in the songs of the American South, brought over by early immigrants  from England. Those songs expressed the hardships of rural life and deep religious beliefs. In the 1920s, country music came into being as its first recordings were made. Early stars like Jimmy Rodger, known as \"The Father of Country Music\", and the Carter Family established its strong traditions - good song-writing, singing and playing.\nMuch of this music was written for and brought to the American public through the cowboy films of the 1930s and 1940s. It was widely popular then and many singers turned up on stage wearing Western fringe and cowboy hats.\nIn the 1950s, the country music recording industry was set up in Nashville and moved away from its rough roots. But singers like John Denver, with his hit track \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\", insisted on the originality and emotions of \"real\" country music.\nYounger artists in the 1990s turned to older country styles and mixed t3vhem with elements of rock 'n' roll. Steve Earle, with his song \"The Devil's Right Hand\", is typical of this so-called \"another country music\".\nCountry music continues to speak to Americans of all ages and backgrounds. And it gives the nation an identity .\nUnlike pop music, country music was American, and only American. During its development, it continued to emphasize that \"American\" element and sounded completely different from its English ancestors. It may even be said that its sound and story tell the history of the United States.", "id": "high7368.txt"}
