They said housing units require space, construction materials and fuel to heat and cool, regardless of the number of inhabitants.\nFor example, in the United States in 2005, divorced households consumed an extra 73 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and 627 billion gallons of water. An additional 38 million extra rooms required heating and lighting that same year due to divorced households.\nThat costs $6.9 billion in extra utility costs per year, Liu said, plus an added $ 3.6 billion for water, in addition to other costs such as land use.\n\"A married household actually uses resources more efficiently than a divorced household,\" Liu said. He said that in cohabitating  household, people will watch the same television, share the air conditioning and heat and use the same refrigerator. All things use energy at a regularly stable rate, regardless of the number of users.\nLiu said he was not condemning divorce, \"Some people really need to get divorced.\" He said cohabitation--whether by a family or friends--was simply a more environmentally friendly option. Additonally, the researchers noted that trends other than divorce are also changing family living structures, such as the end of multiple generations of a family sharing a home and people remaining single longer.\n\"People's first reaction to this research is surprise, and then it seems simple.\" Liu said in a press release. \"But a lot of things become simple after research is done. Our challenges were to connect the dots and quantify  their relationships. People have been talking about how to protect the environment and fight against climate change, but divorce is a factor that people don't notice and it needs to be considered\".\nHe said the increasing energy demands caused by divorce should be considered by governments when they are creating environmental policies.\nThe research was published in this week's online edition of the", "id": "high16089.txt"}
