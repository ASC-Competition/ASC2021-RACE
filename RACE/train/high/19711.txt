As far as I can tell, he's the first American President to have one.\nThat's because the term\"sense of humor\" really wasn't in common usage until the eighteen-sixties and seventies. In the eighteen-forties and fifties, it was called\"the sense of the ridiculous,\" and didn't have the positive connotations that\"sense of humor\" has today. Back then, what was ridiculous was what invited ridicule . Funniness and cruelty went hand in hand. Of course, they still do a lot of arm-in-arm walking in our day as well.\nLincoln's humor was very different because, for one thing, it was actually \"humor\"as what the word meant in his time. We don't make the distinction between \"wit \"and \"humor\"anymore; but in the nineteenth century people did. Wit was unpleasant and offensive while humor was pleasant and sympathetic. It's the difference we note now when we distinguish between \"laughing with\" and \"laughing at\". Lincoln was much more about \"laughing with\" than \"laughing at\". And when \"laughing at, \" it was often himself he was teasing.\nIn the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates, when Douglas accused Lincoln of being two-faced, Lincoln replied, referencing his plain looking, \"Honestly, if I were two-faced, would I be showing you this one?\"And, in a way, Lincoln's face itself tells us much about his sense of humor. \nYou can comb through thousands of photographs of politicians, soldiers, and the like from Lincoln's time and not find a single smile. \nTrue, the long exposures required for photographs of that time made smiling difficult. Yet Lincoln alone, as far as I can tell, overcame that difficulty.\nInterestingly, while having a sense of humor, or at least the appearance of one provided by comedy writers has become a necessary characteristic for an American President in our time, in the nineteenth century, too much humor was considered problem. And that was the case for Lincoln. A journalist covering the Lincoln-Douglas debates commented that \"I could not take a real personal liking to the man, owing to an inborn weakness. . .that he was extremely fond of jokes, anecdotes and stories.\"", "id": "high19711.txt"}
