Based on two questionnaires , he found there was no link between Facebook use and people with larger groups of friends.\nDr. Roberts, whose work will be presented at the British Psychological Society conference in Harrogate, said, \"The bottom lime conclusion is that our relationships are not dependent on the quantity of communication. They depend on quality, and even Skype  is better at increasing the quality of our communication than time on Facebook.\" Even talking on the phone or texting does not make people feel as good as sharing a smile, the research says.
