Our task was to deliver as many boxes of food as possible to those in need in Camden, New Jersey. There were no Christmas carolers   walking these streets that were lined with boarded-up   houses and broken windows. Mothers kept their children close as they hurried down the streets.  It was mid-afternoon, but even the bright sun couldn't warm this place.\nRed tickets in the windows marked which houses we were to visit. Our white truck stopped in front of one townhouse and our group knocked on the door. In our arms were boxes filled with ham, bread and other essentials to make the perfect Christmas dinner. Four small faces glanced through the curtains and one exhausted mom answered the door. She seemed embarrassed to be caught in her nightgown with undone hair. She was in her mid-20s, but her rough skin and tired eyes added years.\n\"Sacred Heart food delivery service,\" I smiled. \"Where can we put this for you?\"\nShe pointed and as we entered the house, I noticed the conditions they lived in. The children climbed around, wearing only diapers  . There were no carpets, only cold concrete beneath our feet. There was no Christmas tree or decorations. My heart sank. It was so cold, and I found it hard to believe that this was reality for this family. We set the boxes down and the mother grabbed my hand.\n\"You don't know how much of a blessing this is to me and my family,\" she said, crying. _ I opened my arms and gave her a hug.\n\"Happy holidays!\" I replied before I headed out the door. I realized how warm I felt inside.\nThis was unlike anything I had ever experienced. We cannot help what family we are born into, but we can help each other.", "id": "high20305.txt"}
