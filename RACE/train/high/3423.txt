One of his students who often practiced handwriting with old sheets of newspaper complained that he made very little progress though he had learned it with the calligrapher for a long time. His teacher said to him, \"Try to use the best paper. Maybe you'll write better.\"\nThe student did as he was told. It really worked. He made headway not long afterwards and felt curious. He asked his teacher about the reason. The calligrapher answered,\"When you used old newspaper to practice handwriting, you would think you were writing a draft. It didn't matter if you wrote badly as old newspaper was plenty in supply. In that case you wouldn't pay much attention to it. Now you use the best paper and you'll treasure it. Each time you write you feel strongly about the rarity of chances and you'll devote to it with all your heart and soul; you'll do the handwriting much more attentively than practicing. Of course you've made rapid progress.\"\nIndeed, we spend our ordinary days just as they are worthless \"old newspaper\".We don't care if we scrawl and waste it, thinking that it will come endlessly--the \"old newspaper\" is inexhaustible. In such a mood we may each day pass by opportunities but fail to catch any of them.\nLife is not a military exercise but an actual war in which real weapons are used. In everyday life there's no chance for us to draft. That's because what we call \"draft\" actually is the answer sheet we write that cannot be changed.\nEvery day of our life is something new. Let us take every day as a sheet of the best paper.", "id": "high3423.txt"}
