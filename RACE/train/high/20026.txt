I'm Lucy the ladybird and while I'm very much of a lady, I'm not actually a bird but a glowing red bettle with decorative black spots.\nI'm a friendly little bug, to be honest, and simply like to be close with my pals as long as they handle me very gently. I don't bite humans but I do sink my teeth into aphids   which, unlike me, are very harmful to all the plants. I milk the aphids just like people do with cows and I milk them dry of all the sap   they have got from your poor plants. I'm a real gardeners' friend and love helping out around the place by pollinating   flowers, tidying up plants' fallen leaves and helping to turn them into nice rich fertilizer to feed everything both above and below the soil, and naturally, being so attractive to look at, we are perfect living garden decorations. \nOne thing I can not tolerate is all that poisonous pollution from vehicles, garbage burning and other environmentally unfriendly acts that occur in the cities every single minute of the day and night. Pollution of any kind really chokes me to death, so these days, I only live in clean countryside areas, particularly cool ones where it rains and everything grows fresh and green from spring right through to autumn. In winter, when the weather is too cold for me to bear, then I find a nice place to sleep until the snow has gone and I can come back out to play.\nOh! I almost forgot to tell you that although I am not a bird I do have wings and can fly for short distances. So if you pick me up and let me run up and down your hands and arms, then please don't frighten me by screaming if I suddenly decide to take off!", "id": "high20026.txt"}
