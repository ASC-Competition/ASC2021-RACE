They walk in the sea in the middle of the dark Antarctic water. They choose their wives in the dark.They can only hear them--not see them.Then the female penguins lay their eggs and go away for about two months.The males take care of the eggs.If the eggs get cold,there will be no chicks.There is no food.The snow falls heavily and the wind blows strongly--sometimes at 150 kilometers an hour.The penguins do not move.When the females return from the sea,they will not remember their husbands.It does not matter.Only one thing matters--the eggs.Male penguins never fight--unless a penguin leaves a chick for a minute.They then fight because they all want it.They are strange and wonderful birds.", "id": "high802.txt"}
