S. researchers said.\nParents may want to limit what their babies see on television, based on the study, said Donna Mumme, assistant professor of psychology at Tuffs University in Boston, who led the research. \"Children as young as 12 months are making decisions based on the emotional reactions of adults around them,\" Mumme said in a statement. \"It turns out they can also use emotional information they pick up from television.\" Mumme's team already knew that babies watch other children and adults for information about the world. A mother urging her baby to eat some \"yummy\" soup or a brother crying in fear when a dog approaches can influence a baby's reaction.\nMumme's team tested babies to determine if television has the same influence, showing actors reacting on a videotape to objects such as red letter holder, a blue ball, and a yellow lubber. Babies aged 10 months or 12 months were later given the same objects to play with. Ten-month-olds did not seem to be influenced by the videos, but the 1-year-olds were. When the actors acted naturally or positively to an object, the babies happily played with them. But if the actor had seemed afraid or disgusted, the babies would avoid the object.", "id": "high8359.txt"}
