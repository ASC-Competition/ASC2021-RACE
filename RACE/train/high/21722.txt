She shouts out, \"Hi daddy!\" and runs toward the little kitchen. She's always running. I've never seen anyone with as much energy as her, except maybe her mom.\n\"You'd better not make a mess in there, or your mother will be angry!\" I call to her. She stops rattling  for just a second and says, \"OK, daddy. No problem.\" She's a good girl.\nI look at the side table where there's that beautiful black and white photo of her mom that we took last year. Or was it longer? My daughter is always leaving a seasonal flower in front of it. I don't know why. Maybe because the color1s are nice against the photo and the black frame. She's a sweet kid.\nFinally, she comes out to talk to me and I put down the paper. \n\"Listen daddy, I can't stay a while with you tonight because Steve and I are going to a show downtown. I've made some good soup for you and it's all ready on the stove.\"\n\"Now you listen to me, young lady,\" I say, \"you and Steve go and enjoy yourselves. I'm sure your mom will be home soon and we'll eat together.\"\nShe looks doubtful. I pat her head.\n\"Listen\", she says, \"you can call Samantha if you need anything. Do you remember Samantha?\"\nI nod. Samantha is a good neighbor. She lives below us in the ground floor apartment. My wife and her were always chattering away on the phone or having tea.\n\"Daddy?\" She's studying my face. \"Samantha's number is on the fridge and by the phone. OK?\"\n\"OK,\" I say, \"now go on out and have some fun, love.\"\nThe office has really tired me out today. I should make some dinner but I'll have a sleep in this chair for now.", "id": "high21722.txt"}
