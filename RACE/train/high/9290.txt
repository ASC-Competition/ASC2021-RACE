The ad ban includes sugary drinks that account for more than 90% of unhealthy ads. An ad for Coca-Cola, for example, will be removed from a scoreboard   at a high school football game. However, ads for Diet Coke and Dasani water, owned by the same company, are allowed to display .\nThe new rules are part of the First Lady's \"Let's Move\" campaign to fight childhood obesity  . Her goal is to get kids to eat healthier food. The marketing limits came after new USDA regulations that put a limit on the calorie, fat and sugar in most school food items. \"The idea is simple -- our classrooms should be healthy places,\" the First Lady Michelle Obama said. \"Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home, their work shouldn't be destroyed by unhealthy messages in schools.\" However, the healthier food rules are criticized by people who think the government should not control what kids eat and by some students who don't like the healthier foods.\nIt is reported that food companies spend $149 million a year on marketing foods to kids, and many big companies are supporting the new rules. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have started to advertise healthier products. For schools, junk food ads like the Coca-Cola scoreboard will be taken down.\n\"The new limits ensure  that schools remain safe places where kids can learn and eat healthy food,\" Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsak said. The rules will help guide schools on ways to create standards   for foods and physical activities. They will require parents and the community to be involved in the campaign.", "id": "high9290.txt"}
