However, no matter how frequently we renew our phone books, some names always remain. These names remind us of the good times we spent together with our friends. Though we may not see them every  day, they will always stay in our hearts.\nTom was often called \"Big Head\" at school because of his extraordinarily large head. He was one of my close friends at primary school. But since graduation, we have been studying in different cities and haven't seen each other for a long time.\nSeveral days ago, I received an e-mail saying that my former classmates from primary school were holding a party to get together and chat about past memories. I was so excited because [ would get to see Tom again. What would he look like now? Would we still feel as close to each other as we had done back then? I was a little frightened about what I would find.\nWhen I arrived at the party, I did manage to recognize Tom. However, he was much taller than he had been before. What's more, his head was no longer big.\n\"Hi, Buddy. Do you recognize me?\" Tom walked towards me.\n\"Of course. How could I ever forget our ' Big Head' ,\" I said jokingly, \"But where has your big head gone?\"\n\"Haha, maybe it didn't keep up with the steps of time and stayed in the past,\" Tom patted his own head and answered with a laugh.\nAll my _ suddenly disappeared. I realized that time had changed us outwardly, but our friendship hadn't changed at all. I chatted happily with Tom about our shared experiences in primary school.\nThen I looked around the small room and saw different faces, both familiar and unfamiliar, but none of them the faces of strangers. The whole party was filled with a warm atmosphere. Everyone was lost in the sweet memories of childhood. They forgot all their present-day stresses and pressures.\n\"Hey, what are you thinking about? Come and get some pizza!\" A call from a friend woke me up from my thoughts. I hurried towards the table. \"Wait! That biggest piece is mine!\"", "id": "high2832.txt"}
