I thought, well, he's an old guy!\nFor the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before scanning the items. Sure, his words were the usual, \"How's it going?\" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation.\nI thought it was odd. I has grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, \"I just found out I have six months to live,\" and someone would reply, \"Have a great day!\"\nBut that wasn't the end.\nHe gave them the change, walked around the counter, and extended his right hand in an act of friendship. He looked the customers in the eyes. \"I sure want to thank you for shopping here today,\" he told them. \"You have a great day. Bye-bye.\"\nThe looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some sheepish grins. All had been touched by his simple gesture--and in a place they never expected. They would gather their things and walk out, smiling.\nOf course, he did the same to me and I got to know his name--Marty.\nWho was that guy? It was as if Sam Walton had come back from the dead and invaded this old guy's body.\nI had never walked away from that shop feeling like that.", "id": "high4631.txt"}
