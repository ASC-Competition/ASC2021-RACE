There was a public park there. It was a very popular place, and I have tons of precious   memories from times spent there.\nOur teachers often took us to that park for a spring or fall picnic. When I learned martial arts  --Tae Kwon Do, my master usually took us there to train us. There was a hill there which was not high, so I could reach the peak   within forty minutes even though I was very young. From the peak, I could see a lot of places if it was a sunny day.\nThere was a huge rock on the top called Eagle Rock because the shape of the rock looked like the head of an eagle. We spent lots of fun days there. We played hide-and-seek within the limited area, and we sometimes caught frogs and fish in the pond. When we felt thirsty, we enjoyed drinking cold spring water.\nWhen I was a ten-year-old boy, I usually went to the park with my father to exercise early in the morning. It was quite dark, so I sometimes felt afraid, but after I got used to going there, I enjoyed breathing the fresh air and hearing the birds sing.\nRecently, I went back to the park to remember my good times there. When I arrived at the entrance, I was surprised because it didn't seem to be the same as I remembered it. Everything has changed in the thirteen years since I last saw it, but the good memories soon came back. I could almost imagine a boy playing there with a slight smile and shaking hands with me.", "id": "high5234.txt"}
