Buddhist priests were expected to eat only vegetables, and tofu, made from the soybean, was a very important food in their diet.When Buddhism was introduced from China, tofu was also brought to Japan.\nTofu developed in different ways in China and Japan.While the Chinese often changed the\ntaste of tofu by mixing it with strongly - flavored vegetables or meat, the Japanese preferred to eat it using only a simple sauce. Even now, traditional Japanese cooking preserves the original delicacy of tofu, though the way it is served may change from season to season. In summer, for example, it is simply served cold, while in winter it is often eaten as part of a hot dish.\nThe soybean was introduced to the West in the 18th century, but little interest was taken in it. Only scientists recognized its high food value.During the Second World War, when meat was in short supply, the US government encouraged the American people to eat soybean products.However, they never became very popular and, after the war, interest in them dropped off as the supply of meat became plentiful again.\nIn recent years, people in the West have become increasingly aware of the dangers of eating too much animal fat, and as a result, they have turned more and more to soybean products. This is mainly because the soybean provides almost the same food value as meat, and in addition it is a lot more healthful. Much of the margarine   ,salad oil and cooking oil in daily use is now produced from soybean oil.Tofu, a representative soybean product and originally one of the main foods in the diet of Chinese priests, is considered to be one of the healthiest foods available to man.", "id": "high18310.txt"}
