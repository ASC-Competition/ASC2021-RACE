It isn't that our friends are all very busy, it is just that When we haven't got a television. People think that we are very strange. \"But what do you do in the evening?\",they are always asking. The answer is very simple. Both my wife and I have hobbies. We certainly don't spend our evenings staring at the walls. My wife enjoys cooking and painting and often attends evening classes in foreign languages. This is particularly useful as we often go abroad for our holidays.
