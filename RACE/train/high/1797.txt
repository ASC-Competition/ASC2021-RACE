London Mayor Boris Johnston launched the scheme and said London had been \"filled with thousands of gleaming machines that will transform the look and feel of our streets and become as common place on our roads as black cabs and red buses\".\nHowever,there have been a few problems since the scheme was launched last Friday.On the first day some people found they couldn't dock their bike properly and their usage of the bike had not registered.Transport for London did admit they had been expecting a few \"teething problems\" and have said they wouldn't charge for the first day as a\"gesture of goodwill\".Some other people have criticized the lack of docking stations and locks for the bikes as well as the price it costs to hire the bicycles.\nDespite the comments,the green-thinking London Mayor still seems very positive about things,saying,\"My campaign for the capital to become the greatest big cycling city in the world has taken a gigantic pedal-powered push forwards.\"", "id": "high1797.txt"}
