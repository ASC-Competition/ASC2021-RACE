They have come to treat me as one of their own. But my boyfriend and I are attempting to save much more money for the life we want to build, including marriage, a house and kids. Much as I love my \"babies,\" I'm looking forward to beginning a challenging career in a big company. Should I tell the family that I am looking for a new job? I don't want to find one that requires me to begin work immediately, leaving them without child care, but I also don't want them to assume that I'm leaving right away.\nUp-in-the-Air Au Pair\nDEAR AU PAIR: Whatever your arrangement, it is reasonable for them to expect you to be honest and _ They see that you are making changes in your life, and surely they will also understand your desire to advance in a career. Tell them frankly and they should be happy to employ you as long as you are available.\nAmy\nDEAR AMY: I am a freshman in a high school. Last summer my best friend was diagnosed with skin cancer. It isn't very serious, but she seems to be becoming more and more depressed. How can I help her be happy again?\nBest Friend\nDEAR FRIEND: Your best role is to prop up and encourage your friend when she seems down, and to be supportive and kind to her. You're doing a great job with that, and your friend is lucky to have you in her life.\nAmy", "id": "high4191.txt"}
