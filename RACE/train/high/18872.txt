Some kids have no hair at all due to illness. Locks of Love is an organization that helps kids deal with their hair loss by providing real hair wigs   from donors.\nJessica Moon, a photo editor, donates   her hair whenever she cuts it, waiting each time for it to grow the necessary 10 inches. \n\"I don't miss my hair at all,\" Moon said. \"And it grows really quickly.\"\nAt Locks of Love, the focus is on helping kids who have gone bald   and feel embarrassed to go out in public to go on with the activities they normally enjoy. Lauren Kukkamaa, who works for the organization, believes that it is important for kids to live out their lives as normally as possible. \n\"Many times, a lot of children feel embarrassed by their baldness, \" she said. \"They have low self-confidence, so they may want to stop playing sports or going to summer camps. When they get the hair wigs, they feel confident to start doing these things again.\" \n\"For a donor, I think it's a very personal donation,\" said Kukkamaa. \"You're giving of yourself. If you're looking for a way to get involved and give back, I think it's a great opportunity for someone.\" \nMoon, who first donated her hair when she was 15 after she found out her father had cancer, said donating is a good way to make a difference.\n\"The best part is that it's helpful for someone and it does make a difference for patients who need the hair,\" she said.", "id": "high18872.txt"}
