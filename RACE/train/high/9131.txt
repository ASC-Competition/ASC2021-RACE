Should I tell her I didn't cry when someone posted my picture and commented , \"I'm sorry, but aren't authors who write books marketed to young women supposed to be pretty?\"\nDoes she need to know, now, that life isn't fair ? I feel her eyes on me, waiting for an answer I don't have.Words are my tools.Stories are my job.It's possible she'll remember what I say forever, and I have no idea what to say.\nSo I tell her the only thing I can come up with that is absolutely true.I say to my daughter, \"I love you, and there is nothing you could ever do to make me not love you.But I'm disappointed in you right now.There are plenty of reasons for not liking someone.What she looks like isn't one of them.\"\nLucy nods, tears on her cheeks.\"I won't say that again,\" she tells me, and I pull her close, pressing my nose against her hair.As we sit there together,  I pray for her to be smart and strong.I pray for her to find friends, work she loves, a partner who loves her.And still, always, I pray that she will never struggle as I've struggled, that weight will never be her cross to bear.She may not be able to use the word in our home, but I can use in my head.I pray that she will never get fat.", "id": "high9131.txt"}
