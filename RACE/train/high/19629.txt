The scientists found that the two other cells---place and grid cells--developed within the first month.Place cells are thought to help us form a map in our mind.while gird cells help us navigate new and unfamiliar places.The two cells work together, and that's where the trouble might be.\nPeople who took part in a 2013 study played a video game that required them to travel quickly between different places.Monitoring their brains.the scientists.According to researcher Michael Kahana, differences in how gird cells work may help explain why some people have a better sense of direction than others.", "id": "high19629.txt"}
