Ironically they are named for a 19thcentury scientist who invented powerful explosives that came to be used as weapons of war.\nAlfred Nobel, a Swedish-born chemist who died in 1896, was known by some as \"The Mad Scientist,\" and by others as \"The Merchant of Death.\" He was really pacifist, who at one time believed that his explosives could end warfare. Later, he realized that he was wrong.\n\"High explosives will not stop men from war,\" he wrote. \"Nobody will benefit from my inventions except manufacturers of war materials, some generals, and diplomats.\"\nNobel was born in Sweden in 1833. His father was an architect and inventor who moved to Russia. With only one year formal schooling, Nobel became a chemist and inventor by the age of 16.\nHe was also excellent in languages, speaking English, Russian, German, and French in addition to Swedish. He wrote poetry. His study of explosives began with manufacturing liquid nitroglycerin for use in mining and construction. But in 1864, the factory blew up, killing his youngest brother and four others. He then discovered that liquid nitroglycerin could be dried and handled safely to be a mixture, which can explode.\nHe called the mixture dynamite, after the Greek word dynamis, meaning \"power.\" He then perfected a more powerful form of dynamite that made him a multimillionaire. When he died, his fortune was about $9 million.\nNobel never married, and he left his fortune to what has since become known as the Nobel Prizes. The money is invested and the interest is given out every year as prizes for the most important work in six fields: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. Nobel Prize winners receive money, a gold medal, and a diploma.\nPrizes were first awarded in 1901, and the list of Nobel laureates  contains many well-known names: Albert Einstein in Physics, Marie Curie in Chemistry, Toni Morrison and William Faulkner in Literature, Martin Luther King, Jr., for Peace.", "id": "high22882.txt"}
