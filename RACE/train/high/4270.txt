It stood out among big and old coats. It had beautiful tailoring and an unbelievable price: $28. I looked at my son and we both said nothing, but John's eyes shone. Dark, woolen topcoats were popular with teenage boys, but they could cost several hundred dollars new. This coat was even better. John tried it on and turned from side to side, eyeing himself in the mirror. The fit was perfect.\nJohn wore the coat to school the next day and came home with a big _ \"Did the kids like your coat?\" I asked. \"They loved it,\" he said.\nOver the next few weeks, John changed. He was polite, less argumentative, more thoughtful, and on the whole much happier. \"Good dinner, mom,\" he would say every evening. Without a word of objection he would carry in wood for the stove. One day when I suggested that he might start on his homework before dinner, John, who always put things off, said: \"You're right. I guess I will.\" When I mentioned this incident to one of his teachers, she joked that the coat must have changed him.\nJohn and I both know we should never mistake a person's clothes for the real person within them. But there is something to be said for wearing a standard of excellence for the world to see, for practicing standards of excellence in thought, speech, and behavior, and for matching what is on the inside to what is on the outside.", "id": "high4270.txt"}
