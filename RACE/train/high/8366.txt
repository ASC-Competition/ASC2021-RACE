I was 10, and I had been unkind to someone. He said, \"There is no point in being unkind to anyone at any time. You never know who you're going to meet later in life. And by the way, you don't change anything by being unkind. Usually you don't get anywhere.\"\n\"Remember you can do anything you want to do. Don't let anyone say, 'You're not smart enough, it's too hard, it's a foolish idea, no one has done that before, girls don't do that.' \"My mom gave me that advice in 1973. And it allowed me to never worry what others were saying about my job direction.\n\"Always do the best job you can do at whatever you're given, even if you think it's boring.\" Jerry Parkinson, my boss at P&G, told me this in 1979. Here I was fresh out of Harvard Business School(HBS), and I was told to decide how big the hole in the Ivory shampoo bottle should be: 3/8 of an inch or 1/8 of an inch.

But later I realized any job you're given is an opportunity to prove yourself.\n\"Don't be greedy . If you're constantly in the neighborhood of good things, good things will happen to you.\" Tom Tierney, who was my boss at Bain in 1981 and is now on the eBay board, told me this. It's true that you get ahead by praising other people.\nFinally, in 1998, I was in New York watching the ticker  as eBay went public. My husband is a surgeon .I called him and told him the great news. And he said, \"That's nice. But Meg, remember that it's not brain surgery.\"", "id": "high8366.txt"}
