So she made many friends. She even thought she was the most popular animal in the world. \n       One day the rabbit heard hounds   baying   not far from her. Usually, she hurried away at the first sound of a baying dog. But this time she didn't want to run for her life as before. \"I have so many friends, and they could help me,\" she thought. She decided to ask one of them to carry her to safety. \n       The rabbit asked the horse, \"Please, dear friend, will you carry me away from the hounds?\"\n       The horse answered, \"I wish I could help you, but I have work to do for my owner.\" Then the rabbit asked the cow for help. The cow answered, \"I wish I could help you, but it's almost milking time.\"\n      The goat had something important to do, too. So were the sheep and the pig. Every animal the rabbit asked for help seemed to be  _ . Even the calf   had no time for her. Each of her friends said, \"I wish I could help you.\" But all of them had some excuse that prevented them from helping her. \n       Sadly, the rabbit said to herself, \"I have so many friends in the world, but why don't they help me when I'm in danger?\" \n       By this time, the hounds were getting closer. The rabbit didn't have any time to think. She was forced to run for her life. She quickly took off and, luckily, escaped just in time.", "id": "high21196.txt"}
