So state officials have asked hunters to lend a hand.\nThe pythons are originally from Asia. Brought to the US as pets or zoo animals, some were released or broke free into the wild and found Florida's warm weather to be perfect for a new settlement. It is estimated that tens of thousands now live in the everglades and the state's marshy wetlands.\nThese supersize snakes are invasive species. \"The problem is with animals,\" says Carli Segelson, spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. \" The pythons eat native birds, reptiles, and small mammals, many of which are threatened species. \" Since the python moved in,  several native species,  such as bobcats and rabbits,  have   largely disappeared from Florida's wetlands:' So the Florida government has invited hunters to   assist in solving this severe environmental problem.  People will be allowed to hunt pythons  around their breeding grounds for one month, starting on January 12.\nOfficials are even offering cash prizes to whoever kills the most pythons and to whoever  kills the longest Burmese pythons. They are hoping the contest will significantly reduce the  population of this dangerous invader.\n\"Our goal is to help get rid of the pythons from the wild, educate the public about the  snakes' impact on the Florida ecosystem, and inform them of what impacts non-native pets can  have if allowed into the wild, \" Segelson said.  Experts say it's unlikely the snakes will ever be  removed from the wild in Florida. But they hope to bring the python problem under control and  prevent the snakes from doing more harm.", "id": "high18649.txt"}
