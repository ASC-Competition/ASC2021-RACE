Yet more than a fifth admitted that they used ages as an important standard .\nAlthough the survey found widespread agreement that older workers were better than younger colleagues when it came to reliability , commitment , loyalty and customer service , these qualities were not necessarily considered to be worthy of advancement .\nA large number of persons believed that workers between 30 and 39 had the best promotion chances , with only 2 percent giving example of 50 year-olds or above.\nThere was evidence that people were considered old at different ages in different jobs . A young man working in IT said he was considered too old by the age of 28.\nIn fact there was no evidence to suggest that older workers were less valuable to companies than younger workers , in fact the opposite was often true because older workers often brought experience .\nThe findings also suggested that the Government's ideas on age in the workforce may also be out of step with reality.", "id": "high17681.txt"}
