These drivers just drove slowly, taking their own sweet time, as if they had nothing to do and no place in particular to go. Thus, the expression, \" _ \", was born. Consequently, a Sunday driver wasn't necessarily someone who was driving on a Sunday. A person could be a Sunday driver any day of the week. _ .\nThe expression probably came about because there was a time when people would often decide to go for a relaxing drive on Sunday afternoons. A Sunday drive was a common occurrence years ago and especially on a nice warm sunny day. There were no stores open on Sunday because of the \"blue laws\", so you needed to be sure and fill up the gas tank and make any other needed purchases before Sunday arrived.\nSome of the states had strict blue laws that even prohibited some activities on Sunday. However, there is still a lot to be said for the slow, gentle life that once existed. It was a time when very few people worked on Sunday except for those professions vital to our well-being such as those in the medical profession. It was a day \"set apart\" that was used to rest, visit with neighbors and friends, or maybe go to grandma's house for supper. Today there are many who return to work and children who go back to school overly tired on Monday due to a lack of rest. Perhaps there would be less stress related illnesses if we really kept Sunday as a day of rest.", "id": "high4719.txt"}
