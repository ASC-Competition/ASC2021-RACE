Men rule the world, but their mothers and wives rule them.\nMost American women wish to make their husbands and sons successful, but some of them want more for themselves. They want good jobs. When they work they want to be better paid. They want to be as successful as men.\nThe American women's liberation movement was started by women who didn't want to stand behind successful men. They wanted to stand beside men, with the same chance for success. They refused to work side by side with men who do the same work for a higher pay.\nA liberated woman must be proud of being a woman and have confidence in herself. If somebody says to her, \"You have come a long way, baby.\" she will smile and answer, \"Not nearly as far as I'm going to go, baby!\"\nThis movement is quite new, and many American women don't agree yet. But it has already made some important changes in women's lives--- in men's lives, too.", "id": "high4256.txt"}
