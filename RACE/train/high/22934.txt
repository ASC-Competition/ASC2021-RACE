Most people who have taken any kind of maths class have had this experience.What do you do when you get stuck? Perhaps you call a friend.Or you ask a family member for help.But what if it's late at night?\n    Years ago there were very few ways to get help if you were stuck on a maths problem. Maths is different from other school subjects.You often cannot find what to do in a book.A dictionary or even an encyclopedia probably won't help you.You need someone to show you the steps.Learning most kinds of maths is something like learning to play a musical instrument.You need a coach to show you what to do.\n    In many areas there are homework telephone lines.These hot lines have volunteers.They can help you do homework in all subjects.A maths volunteer can explain the steps in a maths problem that has you stumped*\n    Today you can also get help on the Internet.There are several homework help programs and Web pages .In some,you leave your question on a message board.Or you write it in an e-mail note.In other maths-help programs there are live volunteer teachers.You can wait for a real maths teacher to help you do the problem.", "id": "high22934.txt"}
