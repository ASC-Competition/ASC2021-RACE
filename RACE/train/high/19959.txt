Well, that seems to be the case in Belgium where there is currently a movement to have Belgian potato fries officially recognized as cultural heritage.\nThe fries are served in a paper cone  from a \"fritkot\", which is a shack or a food truck. Across Belgium, there are at least 5,000 fritkots which is 10 times more common than McDonald's restaurants in the United States.\nThe movement for the fries to be declared official cultural heritage was started by UNAFRI, also known as the national association of fritkot owners. They claim that their establishments represent Belgium very well. \"A cone of potato chips is Belgium in miniature . What's amazing is that this way of thinking is the same, in spite of differences among communities and regions,\" added spokesman Bernard Lefevre.\nTourists can even be seen to line up with locals in Brussels to buy a cone of fries from wellknown fritkots such as Frit Flagey and Maison Antoine. \"Before I came here, the only thing I knew about Belgium [Z-x-x-k.Com]was that they liked their fries,\" said Rachael Webb, a tourist from Ottowa, Canada.\nIn order to be recognized by UNESCO, it has to be formally supported by the Belgian government of culture.\nAs of right now, UNESCO has a list of 314 items of \"cultural heritage\" that they say is worthy enough to be preserved. Items on the list include Turkish coffee and the old native singing of the Central African Republic.\nPotatoes reached Belgium in the 16th century, but it wasn't until the 19th century that they were cut up into fries and sold as a meal.", "id": "high19959.txt"}
