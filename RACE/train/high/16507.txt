Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\nHow so? How can it affect them?\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as beautiful as any of them. Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party. \"", "id": "high16507.txt"}
