That means a 1.7 metre, 15-year-old high school student who uses steroids \"might get bigger but won't get any taller\", according to a US doctor.\nNearly seven percent of boys in the US try steroids before the end of high school, according to a 1988 study by professors Charles Yesalis and William Buckley, of Penn State University.
