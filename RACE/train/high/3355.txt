What should I do?\nAbraham, Nebraska\nThere are many ways to come up with ideas, one of which is to write down a list of your experiences, as well as things from your imagination. When you want to write, look in the notebook for ideas.\nBooks for writers often have good suggestions, too. One we like isSpilling Ink: A Yong Writer's Handbook by Anne Mazer and Ellen Potter. Perhaps your library has it.\nMy classmates keep asking about a new movie I've seen. But I don't want to spoil it for them. What should I do?\nCorinne (by e-mail)\nYou could ask your classmates whether they are sure they want to know and if they insist, go ahead and tell them. You may be able to give them a general idea of the movie without revealing details of the ending.\nI'm going to a soccer camp for youth, but I'm not sure if I'm good at soccer or if I'll make friends.\nLouise, New Hampshire\nSoccer camp is for people who share an interest in the sport. No matter what a person's ability is at the beginning, it's likely that everyone will leave camp with improved skills.\nSharing a common interest may make conversations easier. Smile, be friendly, and have a sense of humor. Before long, you may find that you've made some good friends.\nSomeone invited me to a birthday party. When I got there, kids were doing stuff I'm not interested in, like watching scary movies. I told them my mom would pick me up, so I just left. Was I rude for doing that?\nSam (by e-mail)\nYou just did the right thing and that isn't being rude.\nWe hope you'll talk with your parents about this. They're probably proud of what you did. They may have other suggestions for you, too. Talk about different situations that might come up and what would be the best way to handle   them.", "id": "high3355.txt"}
