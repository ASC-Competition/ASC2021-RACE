Simon said that he leaves his basement apartment in a small town at about 3:30 p.m. to get to the Lakesside hotel and Casino in Osceola where he begins to work at 11:00 p.m. for $9.07 per hour. His wife suffered a stoke nine years ago and some days there just isn't enough money to put gas in the couple's 2002 car. Moving closer to his job would likely mean paying more than he now does in monthly rent--$400.\nFamily and a job are \"the two most important things I can think of,\" Simon said, explaining why he walks to his job. He and his wife, Renee, adopted their now 22-year-grandson, Steven, who has been unemployed since January.\nAlthough some people along the route do stop to offer him a lift, they often drop him off about 8 miles from home. But Simon doesn't seem to mind. He describes the walking route as \"picturesque \" and sounds like he enjoy passing the cows and fields along the way. He's done the walk in all kinds of weather, including snow. It's a little dangerous because trucks frequent Interstate highway 35, whizzing   past him at 70 miles per hour.\nSimon story has a familiar ring. Last month there were storied written about a Detroit man named James Robertson who for years has been walking 21 miles roundtrip through city streets to and from his factory job. The media attention got Robertson $350,000 from a GoFundMe campaign and a new car. We wonder what the Internet holds for Simon.", "id": "high14487.txt"}
