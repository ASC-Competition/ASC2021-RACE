But how often do you clean out and disinfect  your fridge? Well, probably not often enough, according to a recent study, which found out that the fridge is the second dirtiest place in your house, just behind the bathroom.\nFridge temperatures were often set too high, allowing the growth of bacteria, which included E.coil, Enterobacteria, and S. aureus, all of which will give you an easy access to food poisoning. So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat?\nFor starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat.\nMake sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case.\nSome modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher.\nMake sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding  ground for bacteria.\nCover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days.\nKeep bottles and jars closed.\nKeep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution.\nStore raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to stop juices dripping onto other foods.\nFinally, use common sense, and throw away old food.", "id": "high7184.txt"}
