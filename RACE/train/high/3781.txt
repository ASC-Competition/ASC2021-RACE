She asked her kindergarten teacher to let her go to school sooner and she also skipped  the second grade of primary school . Her life from the age of six till about fourteen was very hard. For many women such difficulty would be too heavy to bear . But not for Oprah. When she was fourteen, Oprah went to live with her father. Her father showed her how hard work and discipline  could lead to self-improvement. Oprah listened to her father, and a few years later she won a college scholarship that allowed her to go to university.\nTwo years later, after graduation, she started working for television. For more than ten years she worked for different TV stations across the country. In 1984, she moved to Chicago, where she became the host of a talk show called \"AM Chicago\". When Oprah started, \"AM Chicago\" had few listeners. By September of the next year, the show was so successful that it was given a new name: 'The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\nOprah Winfrey's story encourages many people to believe that success and happiness in life are within reach for everyone.", "id": "high3781.txt"}
