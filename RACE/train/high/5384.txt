As the winter months begin to settle in, I find myself wondering what it is about this traditional meal, which has existed for more than 1,000 years, that makes it a Chinese food favorite.But it seems that the answer lies beyond the dish itself.\nHot pot isn't just designed to keep you warm during the cold months; it's also a social experience.It's a \"theater\" cuisine that turns a meal into an event.There is a lot of fun for everyone to have in adding ingredients to the hot pot.\nHot pot is eaten over two to three hours.For this reason, it is often, considered an evening's entertainment, and time to spend with friends and family.However, many westerners would be _ by the idea of other people sticking chopsticks in their food.When we come to eat at the table in the UK, we tend to have our own individual portions  , although the experience is still a social one.\nA similar experience to the hot pot one can be found in Korean barbecue restaurants, which let you cook your own meat.This allows people to have their meat done however they want.\nFor most Westerners, the idea of going to a restaurant to cook their own food is bizarre  .But having given hot pot a go, I find it's now one of my favorite meals in Beijing.The steam from the pot left my clothes smelling of food when I got home, but perhaps this is also part of the experience.When the chilly   wind is blowing outside, just grab   some chopsticks, some good friends, and dig in.For me it's like throwing a dinner party where my taste buds   and my appetite are equally satisfied in the warm company of friends.", "id": "high5384.txt"}
