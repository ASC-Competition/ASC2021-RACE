And the most difficult thing for the young diabetic patients is that many of them don't have a clear idea when they need to take insulin(a drug used in treating diabetes).The parents of one Long Island boy found the perfect solution--Hero, a specially trained dog that can discover when a diabetic is in trouble and find help.\nJohnny Pion, eight years old, is a poor kid that was told he was a diabetic in 2008.
