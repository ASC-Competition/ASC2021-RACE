Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world.\nThe saddest aspect of this calamity  is that it affects mostly young children.\nEarly detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis.\nScientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear .\nJean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\" said Viry-Babel.\nViry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \"slate.\"\n\"There's only one button, which is called \"Diagnose\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\" he said.\nResearchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March.\nThey also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease.", "id": "high9753.txt"}
