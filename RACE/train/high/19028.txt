One day while working at the cash register in the gift shop, I saw an elderly couple come in with a little girl in a wheelchair. \nAs I looked closer at this girl, I saw that she was kind of perched  on her chair. I then realized that she had no arms or legs, just a head, neck and upper body. She was wearing a little white dress with red dots.\nAs the couple wheeled her up to me I was looking down at the register. I turned my head toward the girl and gave her a wink , As I took the money from her grandparents, I looked back at the girl, who was giving me a nicest, largest smile I had ever seen. All of a sudden her handicap was gone and all I saw was this beautiful girl, whose smile just melted me and almost instantly gave me a completely new sense of what life is all about. She took me away from a poor, unhappy college student and brought me into her world; a world of smiles, love and warmth.\nThat was 10 years ago. I'm a successful business person now and whenever I get down and think about the troubles of the world, I think about that little girl and the unforgettable lesson about life that she taught me.", "id": "high19028.txt"}
