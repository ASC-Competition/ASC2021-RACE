He was going a bit too fast in his shiny, black, 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE, which was only two months old.\nHe was watching for kids rushing out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something. As his car passed, no child came out, but a brick sailed out and-WHUMP!-it hit the Jag's shiny black side door! SCREECH. . . !!!! Immediately Josh stopped the car, jumped out, seized the kid and pushed him up against a parked car. He shouted at the kid, \"What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?!\" Building up a head of steam, he went on. \"That's my new Jag, that brick you threw is gone cost you a lot of money. Why did you throw it?\"\n\"Please, mister, please. . . I'm sorry! I didn't know what else to do!\" begged the youngster. \"I threw the brick because no one else would stop!\" Tears were streaming down the boy's face as he pointed around the parked car. \"It's my brother, mister,\" he said. \"He rolled off the curb  and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up. \" Sobbing, the boy asked the businessman, \"Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair?\" He's hurt and he's too heavy for me. \"\nMoved beyond words, the young businessman tried hard to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. Straining, he lifted the young man back into the wheelchair and took out his handkerchief and wiped the scrapers and cuts, checking to see that everything was going to be OK. He then watched the younger brother push him down the sidewalk toward their home. \nIt was a long walk back to the black, shining, 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE -- a long and slow walk. Josh never fixed the side door of his Jaguar. He kept the dent  to remind him not to go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at him to get his attention.  _", "id": "high23959.txt"}
