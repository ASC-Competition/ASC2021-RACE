Edison accepted his request.\nThe young man asked, \"How can you invent so many things and achieve your fame?\"\nThe scientist said, \"It seems that you have been thinking of becoming famous every day.\" The young man nodded, \"Yes. I have been dreaming of being a person as notable  as you. Every minute I am thinking of how to become reputable. I don't know when I can achieve my fame (,).\"\nEdison told him, \"Don't worry, young man. If you want to be a famous man this way, you will have to wait until you die!\"\n\"Why should I?\" the young man was puzzled.\nEdison said, \"What you dream is actually a high building. You never think of how to build it with bricks . Thus the building will never come into reality . However, your story can serve as a mirror. People will remember you because of your illness and laziness. They will often speak of your name while they give warnings to their children. Aren't you a notorious  person by then?\"", "id": "high2608.txt"}
