For her drive and creativity in overcoming those challenges, she's been named national teacher of the year. \nPrincipal Waynes Kettler said he's worked with many outstanding teachers in his 22 years as an educator, but Peterson is \"just that one step above anybody I've ever worked with before.\"  \nKettler and others at Monte Cristo Elementary School talk about the ways she has introduced the learning from other classrooms into her music program and her creativity in working around things such as the lack of money for new music. \nWhen students were reading S.E. Hinton's novel The Outsiders in their regular classroom, Peterson helped them write a 30-minute play with scenes from the book. Then they chose three Broadway tunes that focused on race, equality and social justice, the themes of the book. Peterson composed two other songs herself after classroom discussions about the play and the book. The honor means a lot to residents of Granite Foils. It's inspiring to know that people from small towns even win national honors.\nAs national teacher of the year, Peterson will spend the more years outside the classroom, as a national and international spokeswoman for education. She said it's essential for schools to offer classes such as art or music and physical education because for some kids one of those subjects is the only thing that attracts them to come back to school day after day.", "id": "high20081.txt"}
