As another warm winter approaches, the city can expect the normal clouds of smoke \ncaused by air pollution. \n    But things could start to get better soon. The government is co-operating with a US-\nbased environmental protection agency to update existing buses and trucks with clean fuel \ntechnology. The new technology could reduce air pollutants in existing diesel vehicles (\n) by 40 per cent. The programme will begin by testing buses in Beijing to see if the \ntechnology can be applied to them. \n    \"We encourage the development of public transportation. But at the same time we need \nto reduce pollution from them,\" said an official. \n    Efforts are being made to improve the capital's environment with tighter controls on \nemissions  . Some heavily polluting factories and construction sites, such as those \nowned by the steel giant Shougang Group, have been asked to cut production in November \nand December or be closed. Beijing was the third polluted city in the world at the end of \nlast century, according to the UN. But thanks to recent measures, the capital has made \nsome progress. Last year 224 clear days were rated as having good air quality. In 1998 \nthe air quality index   gave just 100 days as good. \n    \"I am glad to see an improvement,\" said a Senior 1 boy living in the northwest of \nBeijing. \"Compared to other places, the air quality of Beijing is still worrying though.\nI hate the pollution. Once I was riding my bike in the morning when I almost had a traffic\naccident because I couldn't see a car only metres away from me in frog.\" \n    In early October, the skies were covered by such a thick fog that a display show by \nthe visiting French air force was called off. \n    Rapid development, industry, traffic fumes   and sandstorms from the desert all \ncontribute to the city's bad air.", "id": "high18576.txt"}
