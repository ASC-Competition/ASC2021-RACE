Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide.                                              \nAnd no matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer? You want to be a nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a member of our military? You're going to need a good education for every single one of those careers. You cannot drop out of school and just drop into a good job. You've got to train for it and work for it and learn for it.              \nAnd this isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country. The future of America depends on you. What you're learning in school today will determine whether we as a nation can meet our greatest challenges in the future.                             \nYou'll need the insights and critical-thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination. You'll need the creativity and ingenuity you develop in all your classes to build new companies that will create new jobs and boost our economy.              \nIf you quit on school--you're not just quitting on yourself, you're quitting on your country.   \nI get it. I know what it's like. My wife, our First Lady, has a similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didn't have a lot of money. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country.  \nWhere you are right now doesn't have to determine where you'll end up. No one's written your destiny for you, because you write your own destiny. You make your own future. \nThat's what young people like you are doing every day, all across America. \nThat's why today I'm calling on each of you to set your own goals for your education--and do everything you can to meet them. \nWhatever you resolve to do, I want you to commit to it. I want you to really work at it. \nThe truth is, being successful is hard.           \nNo one's born being good at all things. You become good at things through hard work. You're not a varsity athlete the first time you play a new sport. You don't hit every note the first time you sing a song. You've got to practice. The same principle applies to your schoolwork. You might have to do a math problem a few times before you get it right. You might have to read something a few times before you understand it. You definitely have to do a few drafts of a paper before it's good enough to hand in.                       \nAnd even when you're struggling, even when you're discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on you, don't ever give up on yourself, because when you give up on yourself, you give up on your country.", "id": "high19782.txt"}
