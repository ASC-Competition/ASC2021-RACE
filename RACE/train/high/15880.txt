I also love my laptop computer ,as it holds all of my writing and thought .Despite this love of technology ,I know that there are times when I need to move away from these device and truly communication with others.On occasion ,I teach a course called History Matters for a group of higher education managers. My goals for the class include a full discussion of historical themes and ideas .Because I want students to thoroughly study the material and exchange their ideas with each other in the classroom ,I have a rule --no laptop ,ipads ,phones ,etc .When students were told my rule in advance of the class, some of them were not happy .\nMost students assume that year reasons for this rule include unpleasant experiences in the past with students misusing technology . There's a bit of truth to that.Some students assume that I am anti-technology . There's no truth in that at all . I love technology and try to keep up with it so I relate to my students.\nThe real reason why I ask students to leave technology at the door is that I think there are very few places in which we can have deep conversions and truly\ncomplex ideas. Interruptions by technology often break concentration and allow for too much dependence on outside information for ideas . I want students to think differently and make connections between the course the material and the class discussion .\nI've been teaching my history class in this way for many years and the educations reflect student satisfaction with the environment that I create .Students realize that with deep conversation and challenge , they learn at a level that helps them keep the course material beyond the classroom .\nI'm not saying that I won't ever change my mind about technology use in my history class, but until I hear a really good reason for the change ,I'm sticking to my plan. a few hours of technology-free dialogue is just too give up.", "id": "high15880.txt"}
