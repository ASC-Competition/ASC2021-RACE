Anyway, I finished mine and decided to cut my neighbor--Jean's grass while I was at it. She is a sweet person who has gone through some _ times in the last year. Her brother passed away of cancer last year; her sister (who lives with her) is mentally challenged--yet so sweet!\nIt was a difficult time with physical and mental challenges that led her employer in our local hospital to let her go after 25 years of service! Lastly, my neighbor Jean, who is a nurse in our local hospital, was diagnosed with esophageal   cancer in December. She went through radiation and a long recovery--but thankful she is in remission .\nAnyway, in short I was leaving my house this afternoon and she stopped me to thank me for cutting her grass. She told me her dad passed away on Friday and she just arrived home from the funeral service, so she didn't know when I would have time to cut her grass. So, when she arrived home and saw it cut she was more than happy and grateful! I said to her \"You are welcome, just a small act of kindness for a neighbor.\"\nI did it for exercise and shared pleasure not knowing it meant more to her than just doing a neighbor a favor!", "id": "high9047.txt"}
