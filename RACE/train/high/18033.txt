Increasingly the answer seems to be no.\nChris Ward, author of the book Out of Office explains how President Barack Obama's first inauguration  speech was written by 27-year-old Jon Favreau sitting in Starbucks ; how Richard Tait, creator of Cranium, started the board game in a coffee shop; how Michael Acton Smith invented the children's virtual world Moshi Monsters in his local cafe Nero; and how JK Rowling, the novelist behind Harry Potter, believes a cafe is the best place to write.\nIt is a convincing view, and for basic start-ups it makes much more sense to work from home and public spaces such as cafes than renting an expensive office. Offices are hard to find, costly to decorate and involve much tiring administration. Moreover, by staying independent you avoid the misery  of a daily commute , which for many is the worst part of a job.\nThanks to mobile communications, WiFi  and cloud storage, together with the increasing heavy-duty equipment such as photocopiers, fax machines and desktop PCs, the traditional office is becoming redundant  for many sorts of organizations and workers. Of course, factory managers, surgeons, chefs and industrial chemists are still tied to specialist locations.
