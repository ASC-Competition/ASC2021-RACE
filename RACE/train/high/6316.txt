Cats don't want something pushed down their throats, and they'll fight with all their strength to prevent it. In fact, it's amazing how powerful their small bodies can be.\nThe easiest way of pilling a cat is to press the pill into powder. Then mix the powder with a small amount of wet food. If your cat usually eats dry food, she will probably view the wet food as a treat and eat it up.\nIf your cat won't eat the wet food that contains the pill or if she is too ill to eat, you can get a \"pill gun\". There are some basic instructions. Getting your cat's mouth to open is going to be the most difficult part. First, be sure the pill is in a handy place. Then you can put your cat on a bookshelf with her bottom in a corner or you can put her on your lap firmly tied. Have your cat facing to the right if you're right-handed. With your left hand, hold your cat at the cheekbones, putting your palm   at the top of her head. Keeping your finger off the trigger  , with your right hand, Insert the pill gun until the pill is positioned over the tongue and open throat Be sure to give your cat a treat directly after giving the pill.\nIf you don't feel comfortable using a pill gun, you can try giving the pill by hand. Push your cat's head backwards just far enough so that her nose is pointing towards the ceiling. At this point, most cats will slightly open their mouths. With the little finger or ring finger of the hand holding the pill, open the bottom jaw a little more. You may need to hold her top jaw with your other hand while doing this. Aim straight and lightly throw the pill or drop it. Most cats will then swallow the pill.", "id": "high6316.txt"}
