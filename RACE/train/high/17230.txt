But because he was only half the size of the other boys, he mostly had to sit out his high school football games. Even so, Hector's father was always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game. \nA few years later, Hector decided to try out for the college team. The coach kept him on because he always put all his heart into each practice. But still, the boy never got to play. \nUnfortunately, shortly before the big playoff   game, Hector was told that his father had died. The coach suggested he shouldn't come to the game. But the boy wanted to be there.\nOn Saturday, the game wasn't going well. Hector kept asking the coach to give him a chance. Finally, the coach gave in. What a surprise! Hector ran, passed, blocked and tackled   like a star. His team began to catch up. The score was soon tied  . \nNear the end of the game, Hector took the ball and ran all the way for the winning touchdown  . Then the coach came up to him, \"Kid, I can't believe it. You were fantastic! How did you do it?\" Hector replied, with tears in his eyes, \"Well, you knew my dad died, but did you know that he was also blind?\"", "id": "high17230.txt"}
