Within a week I picked them up and put them away in my closet.\nFour months later my husband and I were invited out to dinner. I unboxed a pair of high heels . I hadn't worn them since they were repaired. I put one shoe on my right foot, and then I put the other on my left. I took both shoes off for a closer look. They were exactly the same style, color1 and size, but each was for the right foot.\nI was puzzled, since I had worn the shoes on several occasions and knew I hadn't worn two right shoes. Then I thought of the shoemaker. Although I was sure he wouldn't remember me after such a long time, I telephoned him and explained to him the trouble I had.\n\"Thank goodness you finally called!\" he was nearly shouting, \"An angry woman with two left shoes has been bothering for months!\"", "id": "high20712.txt"}
