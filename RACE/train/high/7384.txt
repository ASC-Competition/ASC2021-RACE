He was the man who lived with my grandmother for thirty years. He was not my grandfather, but an Italian who came down the road one day, selling fruit in Florida.\nJack stopped at my grandmother's house to sell her some oranges just a stone's throw from downtown Miami, and he was delivering her whiskey a week later. He stayed for thirty years. Jack hated the front yard because he thought it was against him. There had been a beautiful lawn  there when Jack came along, but he let it wander off into nothing.
