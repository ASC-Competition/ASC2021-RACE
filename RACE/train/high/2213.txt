Russia and the US, the only two countries to have achieved manned flight, are struggling to keep their new investment, the international space station.\nBut China, which has a long tradition in physics, mathematics and engineering, finds its doctoral graduates welcomed in the US and Europe for decades. And it has been able to learn from 40 years of pioneering successes and mistakes by the USSR and the USA.\nSpace flight is a gamble and the stakes   are high. If successful, China could become a member of the world's most exclusive club, set up a second home on the moon and get a powerful hand at the strategic bargaining table.\nTwo designers from the Shenzhou III project said that 12 astronauts now are undergoing intensive training. One more unmanned space flight is planned before the first manned launch.\nExperts say that the Shenzhou spacecraft already provides China with a space vehicle capable of mounting a lunar program. Chinese scientists have also predicted that Mars will be the next target after the moon.", "id": "high2213.txt"}
