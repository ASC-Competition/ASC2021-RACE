They came there to take part in an unusual competition--one that seeks out and honors the World's Ugliest Dog. Now in its 26th year, the competition is one of the biggest attractions at the annual Sonoma County Fair.\nAmong the leading competitors were Cupcake, who was adopted   from a local dog rescue center in January and Shorty, who would have been put to sleep if its owner, Jason, wasn't kind enough to pick it up. Also competing was 11-year-old veteran Grovie. Described by his owner as short and funny, the Chinese pug is a local resident who has taken part in this contest several times. Then there was 2002 \"World's Ugliest Dog\" and \"Ring of Champions\" winner, Rascal. The 7lbs naturally hairless dog with very few teeth comes from an impressive background  . His grandfather, Chi Chi, holds the Guinness World Record for winning the title \"World's Ugliest Dog\" seven times!\nBut all these impressively \"ugly\" dogs had no chance against Peanut. The two-year-old dog was badly burnt in a fire which caused him to lose his lips, most of his body hair and eyelids. Besides winning the title, $1,500 USD in cash and a large trophy  , the first time winner also enjoyed an all-expenses-paid trip to New York City where he made scheduled appearances on the Today Show and the Jimmy Kimmel Show.\nThe competition is a great way to honor these dogs, many of whom get their unusual looks because of human abuse  . But most importantly, it raises awareness about their adoption by showing the world that ugliness does not prevent dogs from becoming very loving pets.", "id": "high8924.txt"}
