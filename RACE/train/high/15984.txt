After a while, we stopped and everyone on the ship started to shout because we saw a humpback whale . It was wonderful. Sometimes, whales came so close to the ship that you thought you could easily touch them.\nWhile we were watching the whales, a guide was giving us some information about them. She told us that we saw only two kinds of whales -- 50-foot humpback whales (singing whales) and 70-foot fin back whales (the second largest whales on earth). She also said we could easily recognize a whale by its tail because every whale has a different kind of tail just like people have different fingerprints.\nThey all have names, and on this trip, we saw \"Salt\" and \"Pepper\", two whales named by a biologist and a fisherman. They were swimming together all the time.\nI took twenty-seven photos, but it was very hard to take them because the whales were quick and stayed on the surface  of the ocean just for a short time. It was really something. It was one of the chances that a person hardly ever experiences in life, but I had that chance.", "id": "high15984.txt"}
