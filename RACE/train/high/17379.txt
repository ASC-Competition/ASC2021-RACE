The world's largest retailer reported a big drop in sales last month--its worst decline in nearly 30 years. As VOA's Mil Arcega reports, Wal-Mart is not alone.\nA three and a half percent drop in sales does not seem like much.

Going back to its roots is a way, that hopefully, customers will become familiar with it again.\"\nWal-Mart is one of the biggest economic indicators in the retail industry. As the world's largest profit making enterprise, Wal-Mart's yearly revenues  represents about 2.5 percent of total economic activity in the U.S.", "id": "high17379.txt"}
