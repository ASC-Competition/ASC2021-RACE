The Transportation Department is _ a new plan for the city's parking system. There are one million cars on the road in Shanghai but only enough public parking space to provide room for 15 percent of these vehicles . It is no wonder that local drivers get so worried trying to find a place to park.\nThe city is seeing a rise in private car owners. In March, the city sent out 2,000 private car licenses, the highest number of licenses ever sent out in a month. And prices rose to 14,600 yuan, 500 more than in February. Industry experts say this suggests that local people have a strong, active interest in buying cars.\nBy the year 2020, the number of automobiles in Shanghai will probably reach two million. If one parking lot is for each car, then a lot of parking space should be built for these vehicles.\nDowntown Shanghai is most short of parking space.

Based on this idea, the city will limit the number of parking lots in downtown areas and demand higher parking fees but build more parking areas near main subway and bus stops.", "id": "high148.txt"}
