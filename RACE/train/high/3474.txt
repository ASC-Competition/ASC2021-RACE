But people often don't realize the voice needs looking after. Here, Mr. Rubin, a voice expert, reveals how to keep your voice youthful.\nDrink more fluid and avoid spicy food\nYou need water for the vocal cords  to vibrate  well. The body must be kept hydrated enough to make the vocal cords operate well. Drinking 1.5 liters of water a day at intervals of 15 minutes is very important. Mr. Rubin advises avoiding foods with an annoying effect on the stomach, such as onions, chili, fizzy drinks and chocolate.\nRest the throat and talk regularly\nThe vocal cords can be scared if you use your voice during a bad cough. If you have a case of laryngitis  with a cold, you should rest your voice for a day or two, and seek medical advice.\nSimply staying sociable and using your voice is very important. \"As older people get less mobile, they can become socially isolated and speak less.\" says Mr. Rubin. \"The elderly need to communicate with people more. By using the vocal cords, they enable the ageing process to slow down. \"\nImprove your posture\nGood posture is essential to keeping the voice young, so we'd better stand properly. Exercise helps you take deeper breaths as it means there is better airflow through the voice box, producing a stronger tone.\nSing in the shower\nThis is one of the best ways to preserve your voice, as it keeps the larynx muscles strong while the steam lubricates  the voice box. \"Singing is gymnastics for the voice,\" says Mr. Rubin. Joining a choir is one of the best ways to preserve a youthful tone.", "id": "high3474.txt"}
