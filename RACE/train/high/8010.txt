It was sometimes forgotten that he was also a real father of six, grandfather of 18, great-grandfather of eight, and husband to three women.\nHe earned a place in history just like another father of a nation, Mahatma Gandhi. But there was a fundamental difference between these beloved men. While Gandhi was thought to be a depressed family man, Mandela was a strong and loving family man. Even so, Mandela and his family paid dearly for his devotion to his country's freedom.\nMandela himself offered a glimpse into his personal war. \"To be the father of a nation is a great honor, but to be the father of a family is a greater joy. _ \" he said in April 1992, announcing his separation from Winnie.\nIn 1944, Nelson Mandela married Evelyn. \"I could not give up my life in the struggle,\" Mandela explained in his autobiography , Long Walk to Freedom, \"and she (Evelyn) could not live with my devotion to something other than herself and her family... I never lost my admiration for her, but in the end we could not make our marriage work.\" They divorced in 1958.\nWhen Evelyn died in 2004, Mandela stood at her graveside with his third wife, Graca. Winnie also attended the funeral.\nMandela married Winnie in 1958. But Winnie bore the hardship of life as Mandela, enduring her husband's 27-year imprisonment. From prison, Mandela wrote some of the greatest love letters to Winnie. \"I dust it (your photo) carefully every morning - I even touch your nose with mine to regain the electric current that used to run through my blood whenever I did so.\"\nFor many South Africans, it was the end of a fairytale love story when their separation was made public in 1992. \"Tensions\" had arisen and they had agreed on a separation. The hurt in his words was clear: \"Perhaps I was blinded to certain things because of the pain I felt for not being able to play my role as a husband to my wife and a father to my children.\"\n\"Unstable  personal lives seemed freedom fighters' destiny ,\" he said. \"When your life is the struggle, as mine was, there is little room left for family. That has always been my greatest regret, and the most painful aspect of the choice I made.\" The couple divorced in 1996.", "id": "high8010.txt"}
