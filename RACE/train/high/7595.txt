Kwon Yong-seok created the \"Prison Inside Me\"--a stress-reduction center with a punishment theme. People come here to cut themselves off from the outside world and pay to be kept in 60-square-foot (5.6-square-meter) cells  .\nLocated on the outskirts of Hongcheon, about 58 miles (93 km) northeast of Seoul, \"Prison Inside Me\" came to life after Mr. Kwon voluntarily asked to spend time behind bars for \"healing reasons,\" but his request was turned down. \"I didn't know how to stop working back then,\" he said. \"I felt like I was being swept away against my will, and it seemed I couldn't control my own life.\" So, Kwon and his wife Roh Ji-hyang decided to take matters into their own hands, and designed and built a prison-like spiritual center. The construction was completed in June last year and cost about 2 billion won ($19 million).\nThe facility includes 28 cells, furnished with only a toilet, a sink and a small table, where guests can spend time alone, thinking about life and enjoying private thinking periods. Moreover, guests can also join group thinking periods in the hall, where they are given instructions on how to free themselves from what Mr. Kwon calls the \"inner prison\" to find inner peace.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of stressed South Koreans are checking in at the stress-reduction facility to think about their lives and regain control of it. A two-night stay at \"Prison Inside Me\" costs 150,000 won ($146).\nMr. Kwon and his wife explained that at the beginning they had a different plan for the \"relaxation center,\" and imagined a longer stay for their guests, but, given that people weren't able to take more time off, they had to reduce the length of stays to just two days.\nPark Woo-sub, a guest at \"Prison Inside Me,\" said the experience helped him a lot. \"This is my third time in prison. Being kept in a prison makes me hard to breathe, but it also offers time to focus only on me and spend some quiet time with myself.\"\nOthers said the experience would have been more helpful if the conditions had been poorer, like in a real prison.", "id": "high7595.txt"}
