They say that people are feeding the birds, which makes them fat. The pigeons get bigger because they normally eat seeds   and insects   for their main food, not high-fat junk food they are eating in the city centre.\nThe council want people to know that everyone who feeds the pigeons makes the streets crowded  with these birds. They hope to encourage the birds to move away from the city centre and into parks and open spaces.\nTen robotic birds have been brought into the city centre to scare the pigeons away and visitors are asked not to give the pigeons any food. The mechanical birds--known as 'robops'--will sit on the roofs of buildings. They can be moved around to different places. They look like a peregrine falcon, which is a bird that kills pigeons. They even make noises and flap their wings to scare the pigeons. They hope that the pigeons will go away before the city becomes the European Capital of Culture in two years.", "id": "high3009.txt"}
