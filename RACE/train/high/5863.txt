She never refuses them, and I feel honored to be related to such an intelligent person.\nAs I walk with her through her journey, I finally come to the point I have been looking forward to most: her life in America. After passing several tests and finding a kind boss to sponsor her, she becomes a college student at University of California, Los Angeles. At first, I sense her loneliness and panic as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings.Though her English is broken and she knows little about American culture, I can tell she is more than grateful to be here. Here she has access to electricity and running water, and most importantly, better schools. At UCLA, she has so many opportunities to grow and advance in her field.\nHer journey to America was for just one reason: education.Though having an education will better her life, I know she doesn't do it for herself.My mom wants her children to have an easier life that will not require hard labor.I see what my mom goes through, and I'm filled with gratitude that she has made the brave choice to move here.", "id": "high5863.txt"}
