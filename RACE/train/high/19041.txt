Researchers who looked at the entries to a national competition found they were increasingly using Americanisms such as garbage, trash can, sidewalk, candy, sneakers, soda, and flashlight.\nThe stories, written by pupils aged 7 to 13, show how fairy cakes are referred to as cupcakes and a dinner jacket has become a tuxedo. \"Smart\" is now often used for \"clever\" and \"cranky\" for \"irritable\".\nTelevision also has a powerful influence on children's work, with Lady Gaga and Argentinean footballer Lionel Messi among the famous names from TV cropping up repeatedly.\nBut pupils are let down by basic spelling, punctuation and grammar, according to the study by Oxford University Press (OUP), which looked at the entries to BBC Radio Two's \"500 Words\" competition.\nChildren struggled to correctly spell simple words such as \"does\" and \"clothes\" and often failed to use the past tense correctly, frequently writing \"rised\" instead of \"rose\" or \"thinked\" instead of \"thought\".\nResearchers also found that punctuation was underused, especially semi-colons and speech marks.
