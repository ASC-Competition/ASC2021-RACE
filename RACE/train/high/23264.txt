They're now really good friends, but they weren't ten years ago.\nBefore the men ever had a proper conversation, they had a serious physical fight. Peter hit Will over the head with a heavy pot, and then they both rolled down the stairs of Will's North London home before Peter hit him again with a pot.

He says, \"I thought I might be able to help him change  _ .\"\nWill saved Peter's life. \"We're great friends, we get on extremely well, and when we meet, we talk about everything,\" says Will. \"Peter's a fine man.\"", "id": "high23264.txt"}
