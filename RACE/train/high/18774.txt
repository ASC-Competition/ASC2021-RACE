Because they were useful - we were told - for all kinds of jobs. Of course now we know that couldn't be further from the truth, that the subjects that keep young people's options open and unlock doors to all sorts of careers are the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) subjects. \"\nShe also described math as 'the subject that employers value most' and said that pupils who study A-level math will earn 10 per cent more over their lifetime.\n\"These figures show us that too many young people are making choices aged 15 which will hold them back for the rest of their lives.\" she said.", "id": "high18774.txt"}
