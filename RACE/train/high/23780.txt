Males carrying a deadly gene would be released, which would cause their young ones to die immediately. Then the fall in their numbers could help increase production for farmers.\nOxitec, the company which came up with the idea, hopes to begin trials  next year, but some groups are saying no to them,, saying the untested technology could threaten wildlife and human health.\n\"Mass releases of GM insects into the British countryside would be impossible to recall if anything went wrong. Changing one part of an ecosystem  can have knock-on-effects on others in ways that are poorly understood. This could include an increase in different types of pests. Wildlife that feeds on insects could be impaired if there are changes to their food supply,\" said Dr Helen Wallace, the director of Gene-Watch UK.\nHadyn Parry, Oxitec's chief executive, said that there was demand from farmers for the technology and that using GM insects to kill the pests that feed on food crops is better for the environment than chemical sprays. The firm is developing a number of GM insects that would be used in Britain and around the world to protect crops and fight disease in humans.\nOxitec has contacted the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to ask what controls should be put in place around GM moth trials. A spokesman said that while its officials and advisers have discussed Oxitec's plans, there has not been a formal application for a trial. As a result, the department has not reached a view on whether it should go ahead.", "id": "high23780.txt"}
