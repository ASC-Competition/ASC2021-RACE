And technology students in China and the US  have a1ong way to go before they call develop a deep understanding of scientific reasoning, researchers have found.\n    As part of a research to compare science education in China and the US,LeiBao, a professor\n from the Department of Physics of the Ohio State University, gave 5,760;freshmen in three US and four Chinese universities two tests to evaluate content knowledge  and another to assess scientific reasoning\n     |Though Chinese students did better than theirprefix = st1 /UScounterparts in the first two tests that Emphasized on learning facts, both groups \"scored  ly poorly\" on the third test, designed to assess their ability on systematically explore a problem, the results showed.\n    Lei Bao said that the finding challenges conventional wisdom,which holds that teaching science facts will improve students' reasoning ability.\"Our study shows that ,contrary to what many  people would expect,even when students are thoroughly taught the facts,they don't necessarily develop the reasoning skills they need to succeed.''IBao said:'\"Because students need both knowledge and reasoning, we need to explore teaching methods that target both.\"\n    'The current education systems and assessments of China and the US do not emphasize on deep understanding of scientific reasoning in the disciplines of science;technology, engineering and mathematics(STEM),the study concluded.\n    Bao explained that reasoning is good skill for everyone to possess-not just scientists and engineers:The general public also need good reasoning skills in order to correctly interpret scientific findings and think rationally.STEM students need to  _ scientific reasoning in order to handle open-ended real-world tasks in their future careers in science and engineering.\n    How to boost scientific reasoning? The study suggests that educators must go beyond teaching science facts if they hope to boost students' reasoning ability.Bao points to inquiry-based leaning. where students work in groups,question teachers and design their own investigations.This teaching technique is growing in popularity worldwide.", "id": "high23227.txt"}
