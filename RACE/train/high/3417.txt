But don't worry, they're not mad, it's all part of a biennial fund-raising event called Red Nose Day.\nOrganized by the charity Comic Relief, founded in 1985 by two British comedians, the aim of the event is to raise money to fight poverty and injustice in the UK and Africa.\nCelebrities and public figures support the event by making appearances on comic TV shows broadcast by the BBC. This year, for example, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appeared in a music video by One Direction, which the band produced for the event.\nBut Britons don't just raise money for charitable causes on one day a year, they do it all year round. One way of doing so is by shopping in charity shops.\nThese small, inconspicuous shops sell clothes, books and household goods just like any other shop. But there's one big difference--it's all secondhand.\nThere are nearly 10,000 charity shops in the UK, according to the Charity Retail Association. Their business model is simple: Anybody who has things they don't want anymore can donate them to a charity shop, where they are checked for damage, cleaned and priced. Most items go back on sale at a small part of their original price and the money that is made by selling them is used for a charitable cause.\nThe idea of buying used clothes may sound off-putting, but for shoppers who have less spending money, such as the elderly or those in low-paying jobs, it has been a welcome option for years.\nNow, \"thrifting\"--shopping at charity shops-- is also becoming popular with young people looking for alternative fashion.\n\"I love shopping at thrift stores. You can find very unique clothes for a very cheap price. It doesn't bother me that other people may have worn them, I simply wash them before I wear them,\" said Anne Marie, a 19-year-old Internet user from the US, in a comment on a Yahoo forum.\nSo next time you spot a charity shop, why not go inside? Who knows, you might find a lovely dress for just a few pounds. Even better, you can enjoy wearing it in the knowledge that your money helped a good cause.", "id": "high3417.txt"}
