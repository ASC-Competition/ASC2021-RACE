She was about 20, and in a town known as Ayrlie Beach in Northern Queensland. I asked her what it was that she needed most in that moment, and she replied that she needed support, and my arms around her would be the best thing that she could hope for! Because I couldn't do that in that exact moment, I asked her to describe her surroundings to me (I have  ly no idea 'why', at the time), and said that if she hadn't heard from me in about 30 minutes, she could ring me back. I asked her to stay exactly where she was.\nAfter hanging up the phone, I just sat for a few seconds. After only a very short time a phone number jumped into my head. I rang the number and it was a woman who had bought a house from me about 18 months previously, when I was working in Real Estate. My exact words to her were these, \"Oh, it's you Liz, I have no idea why I'm calling you in particular, but my daughter is in trouble in Ayrlie Beach, and I just got the thought to ring you and tell you that. Have you any idea why?\"\n\"It could be because my son lives there,\" says Liz.\n\"Oh really, that's got to be it,\" I said. \"Do you mind giving me his phone number, Liz?\"\n\"Of course not, and I can only hope that he can be of some help!\"\nI rang straight away (only about 5 minutes have passed since telling my daughter that somehow I'd get her help). Fortunately, he answered immediately, and I told him the story of who I was, and why I'd rung.\nI gave him the description of my daughter; where she was standing; and that she needed emotional support if he could find it in his heart to help out so unexpectedly like this. \"Oh yes, I can see her,\" he said...\"she's right across the street from where I'm standing!\" He walked across the street and told my daughter that her Dad had sent him!\nImagine that...she almost fainted: only about 10 minutes had passed since she had rung me! I believe that she said something like this, \"Wow, Dad's getting pretty good at this stuff!\".\nThat's intuition at it's best!", "id": "high21968.txt"}
