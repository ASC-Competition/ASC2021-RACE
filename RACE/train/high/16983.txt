I then began to wonder about the perfect wedding dress, hoping that it would fit me. Even at the age of 22, I had gone through my share of dieting.\n              I am an emotional eater and I knew that at 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 180 pounds, I wasn't at my healthiest. My mother had been doing Weight Watchers for some time and was rapidly seeing results. I took my mother's advice about Weight Watchers. She shared her books with me and explained the program: estimate your daily point target based on your weight and other factors, write down everything you eat and move! The longer I stuck to it, the more I noticed a difference in the way I enjoyed food. I soon began to like eating fruit and vegetables for snacks instead of chocolate bars and chips. My mother and I went on walks together and kept each other in check. Unsurprisingly, I lost twenty pounds soon and looked amazing in my wedding dress.\n              I bought healthy food instead of ice creams and faithfully kept a food journal. I exercised on my Wii Fit and took evening walks. Since I had a hard time finding something healthy to eat, I bought a Weight Watchers cookbook and used it to prepare our meals. I used small plates and bowls to trick myself into believing there was more food than the serving size.\n              Now I'm 28 and weigh 120 pounds, but I still need to lose some weight. I know the challenge is worthwhile. I must insist on it and tomorrow is another day.", "id": "high16983.txt"}
