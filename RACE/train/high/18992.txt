Seeing Jamie so full of life with his new friends, there was no room for imagination that he was ever a rebellious   kid.\nJamie was raised by his mother after his father left ten years ago. They lived in a small flat with little money. Most of their neighbors were alcoholics, so crime was very common. At middle school, he quickly got in with the wrong crowd and began to steal everything from shoes to phones.\nMary didn't realize the result of the trouble Jamie made until he told her he had been stopped from going to school for three weeks. Mary was very angry, but now she has realized that it was the best thing that had happened to both of them.\nDuring the three weeks, Mary made him volunteer at the local community centre where he saw the street dancers for the first time. \"They were so cool and able to express themselves in a way I had never seen before. I asked to join them and they agreed. Because of them I am who I am now.\" Jamie told me, tears in his eyes.\nBack at school, his whole attitude and behavior improved. \"I realized the boys I was hanging out with weren't cool, stealing wasn't cool and getting out of school wasn't cool either. It made me find something I love and have a goal in life.\" he said.\nYes, street dance makes him happy. This kind of dance speaks to people, and gives them a purpose.", "id": "high18992.txt"}
