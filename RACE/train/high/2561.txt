He went over to the dog and noticed it had a note in its mouth. He took the note and it read \"Can I have 12 sausages and a leg of lamb, please. The dog has money in his mouth, as well.\"\nThe butcher looked carefully and was surprised to find that there was really a ten-dollar note there. So he took the money and put the sausages and lamb in a bag, placing it in the dog's mouth. The butcher was so impressed, and since it was about closing time, he decided to shut up shop and follow the dog.\nSo off he went. He followed the dog to a bus stop. The dog stopped and started looking at the timetable. The dog checked out the time, and then sat on one of the seats provided. Along came a bus. The dog walked around to the front, looked at the number, and went back to its seat. Another bus came. Again the dog went around to the front, looked at the number and climbed on. The butcher, by now, open-mouthed, followed it onto the bus.\nThe bus traveled through the town and out into the suburbs. Eventually the dog got up, and moved to the front of the bus. It stood on two back paws and pushed the button to stop the bus. Then it got off with groceries still in its mouth.\nWell, the dog and the butcher were walking along the road, and then the dog turned into a house. It walked up the path, and dropped the groceries on the step. Then it walked back down the path, took a big run, and threw itself against the door. Then again, it threw himself against it. There's no answer at the house. so the dog waited at the door.\nThe butcher watched as a big guy opened the door, and started shouting at it. The butcher ran up, and stopped the guy. \"Why do you shout at the dog? It is really a genius.\" The guy responded, \"You call this clever? This is the second time this week that this stupid dog's forgotten its key.\"", "id": "high2561.txt"}
