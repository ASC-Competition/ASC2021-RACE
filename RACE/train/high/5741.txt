It took only about an hour to read.\nWhen I first received a copy, I thought it was a Get Rich Quick type of publication. Nothing is wrong with Get Rich Quick, but my mind just doesn't run after dreams of wealth. I think that if God ever wants me to be rich, he knows where to find my purse.\nWhen I began reading When Money Talks, Listen!, I was overjoyed to find that Rich Ezzo isn't money hungry either. He, too, is hungry for more important than money.\nSince I love this e-book so much, why wait a week to write the review? Simple. I wanted to see if the effect it had on me was a keeper. After reading the last word of the e-book, I totally agreed with the subtitle   which promised to forever change the way we thought about money. I had so many thoughts running around my mind that I had to install   a stoplight to stop some while others made their way into the picture, then I yielded   them as a few ones arrived in town. I had a mental traffic jam, which only goes to show how slow the traffic usually is.\nIt has been a week and the effect is the same. I truly do look at money differently and have even done a few things differently this week. This is an e-book you 'll want to read, I promise. I often recommend books to my daughter, and this is one that I didn't just \"suggest\"----I left it open at the bottom of the compute and told each one ,\"Read it, you'll love it \".\nI would never point someone in a direction I wouldn't go myself. I strongly advise you to visit the author's website, Myster Money, and to download the e-book. You won't regret it.", "id": "high5741.txt"}
