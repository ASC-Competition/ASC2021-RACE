This was a patient who was believed to be vegetative for five years.\"\nEver since a research paper four years ago described obvious signs of awareness in a vegetative patient, families of patients have been demanding brain scans, said Dr. James Bernat, a spokesman for the American Academy for Neurology.\nBut experts said more study is needed before the specialized brain scans could be used in medical treatment. \"It's still a research tool,\" Bernat said.\nExperts also pointed out that only a few tested patients showed evidence of awareness. And they said it is not clear what degree of consciousness and mental abilities the signs imply.\nThey also noted that the positive signals appeared only in people with traumatic  brain injury---not in patients whose brains had been lacking in oxygen, as can happen when the heart stops.\nThe new study used brain scanning called functional MRI, for 23 patients in a vegetative state and 31 that are minimally  conscious.\nPatients are said to be in a vegetative state if they are tested and found unable to do such things as move on command or follow a moving object with their eyes. Minimally conscious patients show signs of awareness, but they are minimal and discontinuous.", "id": "high11687.txt"}
