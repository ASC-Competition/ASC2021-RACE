But does Mother Nature agree? Animals can't talk, but can they lie in other ways? Can they lie with their bodies and behavior?\nAnimal experts may not call it lying, but they do agree that many animals, from birds to chimpanzees, behave dishonestly to fool other animals. Why? Dishonesty often helps them survive.\nMany kinds of birds are very successful at fooling other animals. For example, a bird called the plover sometimes pretends to be hurt in order to protect its young. When a predator   gets close to its nest, the plover leads the predator away from the nest. How? It pretends to have a broken wing. The predator follows the \"hurt\" adult, leaving the baby birds safe in the nest.\nAnother kind of bird, the scrub jay, buries its food so it always has something to eat. Scrub  jays are also thieves. They watch where others bury their food and steal it. But clever scrub jays seem to know when a thief is watching them. So they go back later, unbury the food, and bury it again somewhere else.\nBirds called cuckoos have found a way to have babies without doing much work. How? They don't make nests. Instead, they get into other birds' nests secretly. Then they lay their eggs and fly away. When the baby birds come out, their adoptive parents feed them.\n _ After a fight, the losing chimp will give its hand to the other. When the winning chimp puts out its hand, too, the chimps are friendly again. But an animal expert once saw a losing chimp take the winner's hand and start fighting again.\nChimps are sneaky in other ways, too. When chimps find food that they love, such as\nbananas, it is natural for them to cry out. Then other chimps come running. But some clever chimps learn to cry very softly when they find food. That way, other chimps don't hear them, and they don't need to share their food.\nAs children, many of us learn the saying \"You can't fool Mother Nature.\" But maybe you can't trust her, either.", "id": "high7594.txt"}
