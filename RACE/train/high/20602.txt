She got  _ and so she had been in the hospital twice. In November I was finally able to get her back to her \"home\".\nAlice had thought her daughter was coming to visit her on Christmas day and that they were going to have the whole family together like the old days. When she finally realized that that happy moment was not going to happen, she was very sad. Knowing that her daughter was coming after Christmas was not enough to make her feel happy, I hated the idea of her being alone on the holiday!\nOn Christmas Eve, I gave her a surprise by asking if she would like to go to a candlelight service at church that night.\nInstead of taking her to my church, I took her to her old neighborhood church where all her friends were. We got there early and I got her a seat where her friends could see her as they came in. God and his angels had a hand in the plan and it worked out perfectly. Then soon some of her friends came to the church and they rushed over to greet her and sit with her.\nThe candlelight service was beautiful and Alice got a lot of love from her old and new friends there.\nThe truth of the story is that I am the one who got the best gift: the smile on Alice's face. The smile on Alice's face shows that I made a difference.", "id": "high20602.txt"}
