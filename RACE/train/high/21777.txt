The number of bacteria is smaller than when the water is just turned on.If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months.\nBut Pace had good news too.He has also been testing the air in US subways.Apart from iron particles  , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh.The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels .\nPace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial  environments of public places.This kind of knowledge might help  _ the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist  attack.", "id": "high21777.txt"}
