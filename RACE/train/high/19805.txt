I noticed that the clerk appeared to be bored with the job--weighing envelopes, handing out stamps, and issuing receipts--the same dull work year after year.\nSo I said to myself, \"I am going to try to make that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like me, I must say something nice, not about myself, but about him.\" So I asked myself, \"What is there about him that I can honestly admire?\" That is sometimes a hard question to answer, especially with strangers. However, in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something I admired very much.\nSo while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm, \"I certainly wish I had your hair.\"\nHe looked up and his face was full of smiles. \"Well, it isn't as good as it used to be,\" he said modestly. We carried on a pleasant conversation and the last thing he said to me was, \"Many people have admired my hair.\"\nI'll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking on air. I'll bet he went home that night and told his wife about it. I'll bet he looked in the mirror and said, \"It is a beautiful head of hair.\"\nThere is one all--important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important.", "id": "high19805.txt"}
