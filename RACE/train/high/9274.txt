When you give blood, you'll be doing one of the most amazing things anybody could dream of -- saving a life.\n _ \nAll types of blood are needed --not just rare ones.

When you arrive, you will be asked a few questions about your health. Then a drop of blood will be taken and tested just to make sure you're not anemic . If all is well, your donation will be taken.\nThis only takes about ten minutes, during which time 470ml of blood will be collected. Most people hardly feel a thing. After a short rest, a drink and biscuits, you'll be up and ready to go. All equipment used in the collection of your blood is new and is never reused, so you don't have to worry about risks to your health in the collection of your blood.\nWho can become a blood donor?\nBecoming a blood donor really is very simple. As long as you're in good health and aged between 17 and 60, you can become a blood donor. If you would like more information or advice, or you want to become a blood donor, ring the donor helpline on 0845 7711.
