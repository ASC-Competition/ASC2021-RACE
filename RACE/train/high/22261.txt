The celebrations have ended. And the work for prefix = st1 /USpresident-elect Barack Obama has begun. The 47-year-old politician rose to the highest place because he was against the war inIraqand he planned to fix the difficult economy. But what will the first African-American president do for race relations?  \nObama's victory appears to have given blacks and other minorities a true national role model. For years, many looked to athletes, musicians and pop stars for inspiration. As Darius Turner, an African-American high school student in Los Angeles, told the Los Angeles Times, \"Kobe (the basketball player) doesn't have to be everyone's role model anymore.\" A USA Today survey found that two-thirds of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites \"will eventually be worked out\".
