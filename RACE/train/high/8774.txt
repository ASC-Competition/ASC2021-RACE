The group's position was approved by some experts.\n\"There is very little one can do in order to increase the chance of having a healthy brain when you get old,\" said Dr. Hans Forstl, who has studied boxing injuries.\n\" One of the best things you can do is avoid boxing.\" He said.\nAccording to the new statement, published in the journal Pediatrics, information from Canada shows a rise in boxing injuries over the past decade.\nPat Russo, a retired police officer who runs a boxing gym in Brooklyn, New York, said injuries are rare in amateur boxing. After 26 years and training thousands of kids, he has seen just one split lip among his students.\n\" If the gym is run properly, injuries are at an absolute minimum,\" Russo said. \"Football is ten times more dangerous. While tennis or football might also help kids gain confidence, boxing holds a special attraction for children in poor neighborhoods, because it allows them to act tough while in trouble.\"\nDr. Robert Cantu, a surgeon   at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Massachusetts, said AAP's attitude makes sense for upper-class and middle-class kids.\n\" Clearly boxing is safer today than it was 20 or 30 years ago, but it is still a very risky activity,\" he said.\n\"For kids in poor areas, however, the situation is different,\" said Cantu. \" The most dangerous thing for the majority of people in boxing is just where they live. They are far safer in the ring  , even taking blows to the head, than they are out in the neighborhood.\"", "id": "high8774.txt"}
