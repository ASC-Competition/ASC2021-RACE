It is also changing the way we interact  and build relationship. These are a few of the recently recognized features of email, say experts, which should cause individuals and organizations to rethink the way they use email.\n\"Email has increased the spread of careless writing habits,\" says Naomi Baron, a professor of linguistics  at an American university. She says the poor spelling, grammar, punctuation and sentence structure of emails reflect  a growing unconcern about the way we write.\nBaron argues that we shouldn't forgive and forget the poor writing often shown in email. \"The more we use email and its tasteless writing, the more it becomes the normal way of writing,\" the professor says.\nOthers say that despite its poor writing, email has finished what several generations of English teachers couldn't: it has made writing fashionable again.\n\"Email is a critical new communication technology.\" says Ian Lancashire, a professor of English at Toronto University. \"It fills the gap between spoken language and the formal methods of writing that existed before email.
