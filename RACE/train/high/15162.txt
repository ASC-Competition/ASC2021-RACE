Cellphones are everywhere, and some people don't know what the limits of cellphone use are.\nFor me, it's just a matter of education, good manners, and common sense. If I go to a beautiful place, it is because I want to enjoy nature. I can do it, but without bothering   other people.\nNowadays, that's the biggest problem. People disturb other people, first with the ringing of their cellphones and then with their conversations because they usually speak very loudly. Not everybody in a public place should have to listen to private conversations  . Even more annoying, you hear just one part of the conversation.\nPeople need to learn how to use cellphones correctly. If there is an emergency  ,cellphones are acceptable, but remember that just a few years ago few people had cellphones and the whole society survived!\nBut again, not everybody wants to listen to other people's private conversations. It's like smoking. _ . Our society has to learn to respect other people.\nSometimes when you are talking to someone, that person interrupts the conversation because of a cellphone call, without saying \"I'm sorry.\" That is bad manners. They don't know how to respect other people. It's just common sense! But our society is sometimes so \"common senseless!\" So, we have to write some rules to prohibit cellphone use in some places.", "id": "high15162.txt"}
