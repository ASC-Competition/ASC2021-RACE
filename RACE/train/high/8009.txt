For many kids, summer holidays mean spending time outdoors and heading toward water- the local swimming pool, a lake, or the beach.\nWhat people wear to go swimming or sunbathing has changed a great deal since the early 1990s. Do you know what early swimsuits  looked like and what they were made of? The earliest swimsuits covered most of the body and were called \"bathing clothes\". They were often made of wool, which made them scratchy  and very heavy when they got wet. Newer materials made it possible to make lighter swimsuits. Over time, swimsuits covered less and less of the body. In 1946, the bikini became popular among women.\nSummer holidays don't just mean going to the water. They can also mean going for a bike ride, or a picnic. It all depends how you want to spend your summer days.\nIf you live or spend your holiday near the water, then fishing, diving and boating are all good possibilities. In summertime, lots of people enjoy playing, picnicking, and just going out with friends on a long summer day until the sun goes down.\nA famous song called Summertime from the opera Porgy and Bess describes life's more relaxed pace in this season, \"Summertime...and the living is easy. Fish are jumping...\" Ask your parents and older relatives about their summertime memories.", "id": "high8009.txt"}
