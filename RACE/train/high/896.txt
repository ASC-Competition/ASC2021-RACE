The bus came on time and I took the window seat. The bus was travelling by the seashore and I was enjoying the soft wind while watching the sea waves  . After a few minutes the bus made its next stop. A young boy and a girl got on. They were standing on my left when the bus pulled off. I looked at them in surprise and realized that all the window seats were taken up. They could sit but not together. _ . I got up and offered them my seat. The young lady smiled kindly and said thanks. I took another seat and we parted our ways. I don't remember whether I got off the bus before them or not.\nMonths passed by. Suddenly one day while I was standing at the same bus stop waiting some time for the bus to arrive I heard a voice.\n\"Excuse me, Uncle.\" I looked in the direction of the voice. It was a beautiful young lady.\nPuzzled, I said, \"I do not recognize you.\"\nShe said, \"Do you remember you gave us your window seat?\"\nPuzzled, I said, \"Maybe, but what is so great in that?\"\nShe said, \"If you had not given your seat that day, perhaps I would have not sat with my friend. By sitting together it helped us bridge a misunderstanding that had been between us forever. Do you know we are getting married next month?\"\n\"Good! God bless both of you,\" I replied.\nThe young lady again said thank you and went on her journey. I realized the importance of giving that day.", "id": "high896.txt"}
