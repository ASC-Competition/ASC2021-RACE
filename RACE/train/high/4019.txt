It was the final quarter. The score was two to one, my son's team in the lead. Parents surrounded the playground, offering encouragement.\nWith less than ten seconds remaining, the ball suddenly rolled in front of my son's teammate, Mickey O' Donnel. With shouts of \"Kick it!\" echoing across the playground, Mickey turned around and gave it everything he had. All around me the crowd erupted . O'Donnel had scored!\nThen there was silence. Mickey had scored all right, but in the wrong goal, ending the game in a tie. For a moment there was a total _ . You see, Mickey has Down syndrome   and for him there is no such thing as a wrong goal. All goals were celebrated by a joyous hug from Mickey. He had even been known to hug the opposing players when they scored.\nThe silence was finally broken when Mickey, his face filled with joy, hugged my son tightly and shouted, \"I scored! I scored. Everybody won! Everybody won!\" For a moment I held my breath, not sure how my son would react. I need not have worried. I watched, through tears, as my son threw up his hand in the classic high-five salute and started chanting, \"Way to go Mickey! Way to go Mickey!\" Within moments both teams surrounded Mickey, joining in the chant and congratulating him on his goal. Mike happily and everyone sent their wishes to him.\nLater that night, when my daughter asked who had won, I smiled as I replied, \"It was a tie. Everybody won.\"", "id": "high4019.txt"}
