Her parents are far away from home, and she has to take care of her younger sister. She is He Can, a student at Anqing Jianzhen Middle School in Anhui, one of the \"stay-at home children\" in her town. To make money, these kids' parents go to big cities to find a job. Their children have to stay at home because they have to go to school.\nHe Can's parents left home when she was only four. They only come back for the Spring Festival every year. Because she had to live with different relatives at different times, He Can went to eight different primary schools.\n\"I used to complain,\" she said. \"But later I understood my parents. They have to go away to make a better life for us.\" He Can said her frequently changing life also has a good side.\n\"When I went to a new school, I had to try to make friends,\" said He Can, \"I became outgoing. Now I'm not afraid of talking to people.\"\nHe Can said her relatives were kind to her. They taught her how to cook and wash clothes.\nWhen she would start junior high school , her parents agreed to rent a house to let her live out with her sister.\nEvery day, He Can gets up at 6:00 am and cooks breakfast. Then He Can does chores   and helps her sister take a shower. She usually goes to bed at 9:30 pm.\nThough busy, He Can is still a top student in her class. She said the secret is never to put things off until tomorrow.\n\" I think my life is OK,\" she said. \"But if possible, I would like my parents to settle down and live with us.\"", "id": "high15799.txt"}
