The devices work like this-A driver must blow into a blood alcohol device linked to the car's ignition. If the result is higher than the legal limit, the car will not start. The device also requires random \"rolling retests\" once the driver is on the road.\nVirginia's current law requires only repeat drunken-driving offenders or those with a blood alcohol level of 0.15 or higher to have an ignition interlock device in their car.\nThe new law, which takes effect in July, will roughly increase the number of people required to use ignition interlock devices four times, and offenders will have to pay about $ 480 for a typical six-month installation.\nThe measure has caused a debate between groups battling drunken driving and those representing offenders. Such groups as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Washington Regional Alcohol Program say that Virginia's 274 alcohol-related road deaths and more than 5,500 injuries in 2010 remained unacceptably high despite years of cracking down on drunken driving. Ignition interlock devices, they say, reduce repeat offenses. But some public defenders and lawyers argue that the devices are too severe a punishment for offenders at the legal blood alcohol limit of 0.08, and that the court system will be burdened by more cases going to trial and lower-income drivers will be affected by the fees.\nDel. Sal R. laquinto, who sponsored the bill, had a simple reply for concerns about the costs of the interlock devices: \"How much does a life cost?\" \"Blowing into a tube for six months, you will remember that, \" Iaquinto said, \" and you are not likely to offend again. \"", "id": "high3881.txt"}
