Athletes from all over the world were competing in the most amazing sports. Just then his grandmother walked into the room. \"I want to be extreme. Would you really let me do that? You always worry about my safety!\" said Jason.\n\"You will have to follow some rules,\" said his grandmother. \"You can only ride in the park -- never on the streets. You have to promise to wear a helmet  . If you hurt yourself too much, I have the right to take your skateboard away. Is it a deal?\"\n\"You bet!\" Jason was so excited that he jumped off the sofa. A week later he had a board and a helmet.\nOn Saturday, his grandmother dropped him off near the park. He was happy to have a grandmother who let him try new things.\nKids in the park were moving quickly up and down the ramps  . They flew into the air and landed as easily as birds. When he watched the X games, Jason felt like he was doing the tricks himself. But watching these kids up close, he knew that none of it was going to be easy.

Now he felt calm because things had gone wrong, and he was fine!\nNext time he kicked off harder and went fast and farther. \"Excellent!\" said a girl as she passed him. \"Extreme!\" laughed Jason to himself. \"Not quite.\"", "id": "high3896.txt"}
