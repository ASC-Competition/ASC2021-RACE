For many, it's surprisingly difficult. This is especially true of editors, who by nature tend to be eager and engaged participants in everything they do. Consider these scenes:\nIt's late in the day. That front-page package you've been working on is nearly complete; the last editing and it's finished. Then enters the chief editor, who makes a suggestion requiring a more-than-modest rearrangement of the design and the addition of an information box. You want to scream: \"No! It's done!\" What do you do?\nThe first rule of saying no to the boss is \"don't say no\". He probably has something in mind when he makes the suggestion, and it's up to you to find out what. The second rule is \"don't raise the risks by challenging his authority\". That issue is already decided. The third rule is \"be ready to put forward choices and consequences\". The boss's suggestion might be appropriate, but there are always consequences. He might not know about the pages backing up that need attention, or about the designer who had to go home sick. Tell him he can have what he wants, but explain the consequences. Understand what he's trying to accomplish and propose a Plan B that will make it happen without destroying what you've done so far.\nHere's another case. Your least-favorite reporter suggests a silly story idea. This one should be easy, but it's not. If you say no, even politely, you risk holding back further ideas, not just from that reporter, but from others who heard that you turned down the idea. This case is common in newsrooms that lack a systematic way to filter story suggestions.\nTwo steps are necessary. First, you need a system for how stories are proposed and reviewed. Reporters can bear rejection of their ideas if they believe they are given a fair hearing. Your natural reaction and strong rejection, even of a worthless idea, might not qualify as systematic or fair.\nSecond, the people you work with need to make a \"What if\",agreement covering ''What if my idea is turned down?\" How are people expected to react? Is there an appeal process? Can they perfect the idea and resubmit it? By imagining \"What if...?\" situations before they happen, you can reach understanding that will help ease you out of opposition.", "id": "high16620.txt"}
