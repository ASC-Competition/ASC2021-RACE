Or cut me off in traffic. Actually, I have a lot of these little annoyances -- don't we all? And it isn't always easy to find peace when you've become upset or annoyed.\nLet me tell you a little secret to finding peace of mind: _ \nSee, the cause of our stress, anger and irritation is that things don't go the way we like, the way we expect them to. Think of how many times this has been true for you. And so the solution is simple: expect things to go wrong, expect things to be different than we hoped or planned, expect the unexpected to happen. And accept it.\nOne quick example: on our recent trip to Japan, I told my kids to expect things to go wrong -- they always do on a trip. I told them, \"See it as part of the adventure.\"\nAnd this worked like a charm. When we took the wrong train on a foreign-language subway system, or when it rained on the day we went to Disney Sea, or when we took three trains and walked 10 blocks only to find the National Children's Castle closed on Mondays ... they said, \"It's part of the adventure!\" And it was all OK -- we didn't get too bothered.\nSo when the nice glass you bought inevitably falls and breaks, someday, you might get upset. But not if you see the glass as already broken, from the day you get it. You know it'll break someday, so from the beginning, see it as already broken. Be a time-traveler, or someone with time-traveling vision, and see the future of this glass, from this moment until it inevitably breaks. And when it breaks, you won't be upset or sad -- because it was already broken, from the day you got it. And you'll realize that every moment you have with it is precious.", "id": "high607.txt"}
