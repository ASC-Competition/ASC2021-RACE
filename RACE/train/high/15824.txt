Decision-making styles are significantly different in different cultures.\nIn any approach to a problem and in any negotiations, the Western world turns to the\"I to you\" approach while Japan,the \"you to you\" approach. The former means both sides present their arguments openly from their own point of view. Naturally, often comes a conflict situation, which Westerners are very skillful in dealing with.The latter is based on each side trying to understand the other person's point of view. Thus, the direction of the meeting is a mutual  attempt to reduce confrontation and achieve harmony.\nBesides, Western decision-making goes mostly from top management and often does not consult middle management or the worker. However, in Japan great consideration is given to the thoughts and opinions of everyone at all levels. Based on \"bottom-up direction\", ideas can be created at the lowest levels, travel upward through an organization and have an effect on the final decision.\nDifference in decision-making also comes from different communication styles. The Japanese business person works to achieve harmony, even if the deal fallsthrough, and will spend whatever time is necessary to determine a \"you to you\" approach, communicating personal views only indirectly. They put a thorough job above the Western deadline approach. So the Japanese are thorough in their meetings. Thus Americans are often annoyed by the many meetings in many Japanese businesses. But where the American is pressingfor a specific decision, the Japanese is trying to think up a rather broad direction.\nOn the other hand, once a given agreement is made, it is the Japanese who sometimes wonderat the slow pace in which Westerners carry out the decision. The Japanese are eager to move forward and Westerners, perhaps, fall behind as they take the time for in-depth planning.", "id": "high15824.txt"}
