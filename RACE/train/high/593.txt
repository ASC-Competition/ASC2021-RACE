When my friend Maxie says \"Have a nice day\" with a smile, I know she sincerely cares about what happens to me. I feel loved and secure since another person cares about me and wishes me well.\n\"Have a nice day. Next!\"This version of the expression is spoken by a salesgirl at the supermarket who is rushing me and my groceries out the door. The words come out in the same tone with a fixed procedure. They are spoken at me, not to me. Obviously, the concern for my day and everyone else's is the management's attempt to increase business.\nThe expression is one of those behaviors that help people get along with each other. Sometimes it indicates the end of a meeting. As soon as you hear it, you know the meeting is at an end. Sometimes the expression saves us when we don't know what to say \"oh, you may have a tooth out? I'm terribly sorry, but have a nice day.\"\nThe expression can be pleasant. If a stranger says \"Have a nice day\" to you, you may find it heart-warming because someone you don't know has tried to be nice to you.\nAlthough the use of the expression is an insincere, meaningless social custom at times, there is nothing wrong with the sentence except that it is a little uninteresting. The salesgirl, the waitress, the teacher, and all the countless others who speak it without thinking may not really care about my day. But in a strange and comfortable way, it's nice to know they care enough to pretend they care when they really don't care all that much. While the expression may not often be sincere, it is always spoken. The point is that people say it all the time when they like.", "id": "high593.txt"}
