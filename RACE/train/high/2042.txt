It is made up of \"motor\" and \"hotel\" and it is really a hotel for people who arrive by car (how-ever, you don't need a car to stay at one). You have to pay when you arrive for your room, which usually has a bath. Meals are not provided, but there will certainly be a cafeteria  . Americans eat a lot of salads and sandwiches. Along the main roads there are a lot of motels. Each tries to offer more than next. Some provide television in every bedroom; others have swimming pools; and so on. Motels are especially useful when you are in the country, far from a town or city. You will also find them in the big National Parks.\nIn these great National Parks, you may meet guests you don't expect to see. An American friend told me a little story. In the middle of a moonless night she heard strange noises outside her motel window in the Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Thinking it might be a thief, she jumped out of bed, opened the door and _ towards a dark shadow . As she got close, she saw the thief. She was dreadfully frightened: it wasn't a human thief -- it was a big black bear. The bear was turning over some empty tins with its paw, looking for tasty bits of food. My friend decided to leave that particular thief alone!\nThere are also, of course, places called \"rooming houses\",  where they receive lodgers  . You will see such signs as Tourists or Rooms Rent, and you could try one of these. A word of warning -- looking for a room in New York during the tourist season is like looking for gold on the moon!", "id": "high2042.txt"}
