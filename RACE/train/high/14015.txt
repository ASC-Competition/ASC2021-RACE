At least you are no longer a child. They call you \"young lady\". You then enjoy the pleasure of being a young lady. You are proud of being a grown-up teenager. People welcome you-this young lady-heartily. You are glad that your prayer has been answered.\nBut there is always something that troubles you a lot. You say; \"Papa and Mama, give me some money please. My pocket money is all gone already.\"\n\"No\", they say, \"your age is a dangerous age. If you have too much money to spend, it won't do you any good.\" Then you have to stay at home because you dare not go out with an empty pocket.\nAnother time you tell your grandma, \"Grandma, see, I am a grown-up now.\"\n\"Good, now, you can sit here and knit   this for me while I go and have a rest.\" To show that you are no more a child, you have to sit there the whole afternoon doing the work, which only a grown-up can do. After an hour, you find it hard to do, and give the knitting basket back to your grandma. Your grandma criticizes your work. You hear what she says, \"Such a big girl can't do such easy work.\" You wish then you were a child again.\nBut the fact is, you are growing up, and you can't help it. That's the way it goes!", "id": "high14015.txt"}
