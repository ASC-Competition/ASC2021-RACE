It breaks my heart to see my friends smoking. I try to get them to give up smoking.\" She says.\nSo why does Connie walk into convenience stores and try to buy cigarettes? She is testing to see if stores will sell cigarettes to a kid who is younger than 18. \"You have to be 18 to purchase cigarettes, and I'm 16, so if they sell to me, they're breaking the law,\" Connie says.\nConnie isn't a vigilante  ; She works with local police in her town of Castro Valley, California. Officers drive her to stores, and she goes in alone to try to buy cigarettes. If the person behind the counter sells her a pack, an officer comes in and writes the business a ticket for breaking the law.\nMost stores obey the law and don't sell her cigarettes. The law requires that customers show ID if store employees ask them to. \"When they ask your age, you can't lie,\" Connie says. \"Most stores don't sell to me. In a year, we've visited almost 150 stores and had only 15 sales.\"\nWorking undercover can be scary, even with police nearby. Connie said one cashier refused to sell her cigarettes and then got angry when he found out her age. He threatened to call the authorities. \"To calm him down, the police went in to explain that I was undercover,\" she says.\nMost teens wouldn't think of going undercover for the police. What's Connie's motivation  ? For starters, she can't stand smoking. But she also believes it's important for young people like her to try to make a real impact in their communities. In her view, teens can do more than get good grades in school, do chores at home, and do well in out-of-class activities.\nEvery time she stops the sale of cigarettes to children, she's helping to uphold the law. \"A single teenager can make a big difference,\" Connie says. \"For the most part, when stores get caught, they learn their lesson and don't do it again.\"", "id": "high3490.txt"}
