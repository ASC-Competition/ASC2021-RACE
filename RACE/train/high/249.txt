But today teenagers and their parents argue over something else: money.\nChildren are spending lots of it. Parents used to say to their children, \"You're wearing that?\" Now they say, \"You paid how much for that?\"\nChildren in the US today spend five times more money than their parents did when they were young.\nSo what are all these children buying? The list is long: ipods trainers , cellphones and jeans are typical items that children \"have to\" buy. And they will do anything to get them. They ask their parents over and over until they buy them.\nBut parents also need to take the blame for spending so much money. They want their children to have the best stuff. They end up competing with other parents over what their children have.\nSo no wonder children find it hard to learn the importance of saving money rather than spending it all the time.\nAnd it's hard to save when companies use advertising and clever slogans to encourage young people to buy their products. They even encourage children to keep asking their parents for something until they get it.\nToday, you don't even need to have money in order to buy something. Banks give out credit cards and loans all the time so people are saving less and less. We are used to there being lots of money around. And if you don't have much you can always borrow some.\nBut this hasn't always been the case. When our grandparents were young there was very little money and everyone had to save hard for things they bought. They only bought things they needed, not things they just wanted.\nThe older generation made the wise expression, \"Money doesn't grow on trees.\" This is as true now as it was 50 years ago. They give money a great deal of value. And we all have a lot to learn from them.", "id": "high249.txt"}
