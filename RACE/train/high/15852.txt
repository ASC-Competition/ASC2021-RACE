The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.\nThe researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less\neffects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married.", "id": "high15852.txt"}
