You don't need a gym membership to do this effective exercise. Here's how to prepare:\nThe only equipment you really need is a decent pair of walking shoes. What matters most is comfort. When you're shopping for shoes:\n*Wear the socks you plan to exercise in. That way you'll get the best fit.\n*Try on both shoes. Most people's feet aren't exactly the same size. Choose a pair that fits your larger foot.\n*Allow a little extra room. Feet swell when you walk, so buy a pair with about a thumb's width between your longest toe and the toe of the shoe.\nSure, walking comes naturally. But the following tips will help you stay comfortable and get the most out of your walk:\n*Look ahead. Keep your neck straight and your head held high. If you have to look down to see where you're going, lower your eyes, not your head.\n*Move both arms. Let your arms swing naturally at your sides, and you'll burn up to 15 percent more calories by keeping your arms moving.\n*Don't carry unnecessary weight. Some people try to get in extra exercise by carrying a couple of light dumbbells , but fitness-walking experts say that's risky: The weights can pull you off balance and tighten muscles in your back or legs.\nWalking is one of the safest activities. Still, the following tips may be helpful:\n*If you're walking at night, wear a piece of reflective clothing.\n*If the path is dimly lit, bring a good flashlight.\n*When the weather's hot, be sure to drink some water before you set out and better take a bottle of water with you if you plan to walk quite a long time.\n*If your path is rough, protect your ankles. Consider wearing a comfortable bandage for support.", "id": "high5355.txt"}
