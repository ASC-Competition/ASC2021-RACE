On February 24, Tillicum, a six-ton orca ,was performing with his trainer, Dawn Brancheau, who stood on a platform by his pool.\nThey had done the same show together many times before, without incident. This time, though, events took a terrible turn. Without warning, Tillicum leaped from the water, took hold of Branchcheau by her hair, and dragged her deep below the water's surface. Before other trainers could react, Brancheau drowned.\nAlthough known as killer whales, orcas are the largest member of the dolphin family. They are easy to train, and performances like Tillicum's have been done safely thousands of times. Yet Dawn Brancheau's death was a shocking reminder of what can happen when human being act together with wild animals. People began  to ask, \"Should orcas be kept in captivity \"\nYes\nWorldwide, only 42 orcas are being kept by humans. Scientists know very little about these huge sea animals, which are difficult to study in the wild. However, they do know that orcas are easily harmed by pollution. As our oceans become ever more damaged by human activity, observing orcas up close helps us understand them and do a better job of protecting them in nature.\n\"I think that some dangerous animals, such as killer whales, should be kept in captivity because it raises awareness about them and educates people about wild animals,\" says Lauren, 12, a 6-grader from Colorado. \"Keeping some in captivity will help protect their species.\"\nNo\nEnclosed habitats can be painful to wild animals, and make them act in unpredictable even harmful ways.\n\"It is wrong to keep these animals in captivity\", says Prathm, 12. The 7th-grader from New Jersey, adds, \"They should live in their own habitats, not be used as entertainment slaves.\"\nRichard Ellis, a marine conservationist in New York, agrees. \"It is part of human nature to keep wild animals in small spaces and train them to do tricks,\" he says. \"I' m against it because I think it _ the animals.\"", "id": "high8368.txt"}
