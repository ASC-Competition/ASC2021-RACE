Hundreds of people came to watch the end of his starvation experiment, which has become one of London's main tourist attractions.\nLooking thinner and darker, 30-year-old Blaine was taken out of his box over the River Thames and immediately went to hospital. He was then slowly reintroduced to food, a process doctors say could be life threatening. He had been drinking only water since September 5.\nA native of Brooklyn, New York, Blaine first became known as a street magician in the early 1990s. He soon found himself doing magic tricks in bars for the likes of American actor Leonardo DiCaprio and his super model friends.\nOver the last decade Blaine has become famous with a combination of breathtaking magic and clever tricks aimed at getting a lot of attention. In 1999, he was buried in a coffin   for one week and, in 2000, he spent 62 hours in a giant block of ice. Last year he stood on top of a 25-meter pillar   in the center of New York for 35 hours before jumping into a pile of boxes.\n\"I think a lot of people are unable to accept that they're able to do what they can do,\" he said. \"They don't realize we can survive. The human being is an amazing creation.\"\nBut he seems to have suffered from spending so long in the glass box. He said that at times he was unable to see, had serious back pains and lost his sense of taste.", "id": "high461.txt"}
