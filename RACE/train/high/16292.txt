It killed me to see that lovely girl with a cigarette  in her mouth. I told her how I felt. Martha continued to smoke, saying, \"It's my life,\" and so on. I told her if she didn't stop smoking, I wouldn't send her to college. She agreed to give it up.\nLast night there was cigarette smell on Martha's breath. She had to say she had broken her word.
