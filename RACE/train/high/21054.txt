My response often is \"You have as much time as the president.\" I usually carry on a bit about there being twenty-four hours in the day for everyone, and suggest that \"not enough time\" is not an acceptable explanation of not getting something done.\nOnce in graduate school, I tried to prove to my professor that I was working hard. His answer was \"That's irrelevant  .What's important is the quality of your work.\" That led me to a new idea: the quality of the work, which is perhaps best explained in a sign: \"Don't work harder. Work smarter.\"\nIf you can't get more time, as few of us can, the only solution is to improve the quality of your work. That means improving ways to get more out of the same time. That should lead us to an analysis of our work habits, which for students should be read as \"study habits\".\nThen as a smart student, you will seek to improve those skills that you use in study, chiefly reading and writing. If you can, it will pay off in all your subjects.\nAs to improving reading, one suggestion is to take a quick nap when you feel reading puts you to sleep, which later helps you read better. The second solution is to speed up.\nBut there are other issues. First, you need to find a place where you can work without unnecessary disturbances. Second, you need to take control. Success depends on realizing that you have to take active control over what you are doing. Third, you might as well get hold of a good book on reading and master the reading skills that pay off in all your classes.\nTalking about advice on good writing habits, you simply have to master the writing skills. Increasing your efficiency in both reading and writing will pay off immediately in terms of the quality of your work and in terms of the time spent doing it. Then you will be able to do better work in less time. And maybe you will find time to play golf with the president.", "id": "high21054.txt"}
