But when a teenage boy approached him with a knife, Diaz knew the evening was about to take a more dramatic  turn.\nThe young man demanded Diaz's wallet, and Diaz passed it over without objection . But just as he turned to walk away, Diaz called, \"Hey, wait a minute. You forgot something.\"\nThe young man turned around, surprised.\n\"If you're going to rob people for the rest of the night, you might as well take my coat to keep warm.\"\nThe teenager looked at Diaz in disbelief, and asked why he would do such a thing. Diaz replied, \"If you're willing to risk your freedom for a few dollars, I guess you must really need the money.\"He said he was heading out for dinner, and that he would be happy to take someone with him.\nThe young man decided to _ his offer. As they were sitting at the table, the manager, dishwashers and waiters all stopped over to say hello to Diaz, and the young man was amazed at his popularity.\n\"Haven't you been taught that you should be nice to everybody?\"Diaz asked him.\n\"Yeah, but I didn't think people actually behaved that way,\" the teenager replied. Thanks to Diaz, he was beginning to see that kindness wasn't so strange, after all.\nWhen the bill came, Diaz told the teen that he'd have to get the check. After all, he still had Diaz's wallet.\nBut the teenager put the wallet on the table without a moment's thought, and Diaz treated him to dinner. Diaz also gave the would-be robber a $20 bill -- in exchange for his knife. \"I figure, you know, if you treat people right, you can only hope that they treat you right,\" Diaz said.", "id": "high5910.txt"}
