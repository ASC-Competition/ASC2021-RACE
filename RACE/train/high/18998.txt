You feel upset if your phone is getting low on power, and you secretly worry things will go wrong at work if you're not there. All these can be called \"always on\" stress caused by smart phone addiction.\nFor some people, smart phones have liberated them from the nine-to-five work. Flexible working has given them more autonomy  in their working lives and enabled them to spend more time with their friends and families. For many others though, smart phones have become tyrants   in their pockets, never allowing them to turn them off, relax and recharge their batteries.\nPittsburgh-based developer Kevin Holesh was worried about how much he was ignoring his family and friends in favour of his iPhone. So he developed an app -- Moment -- to monitor his usage. The app enables users to see how much time they're spending on the device and set up warnings if the usage limits are breached  . \"Moment's goal is to promote balance in your life,\" his website explains. \"Some time on your phone, some time off it enjoying your loving family and friends around you.\"\nDr Christine Grant, an occupational psychologist at Coventry University, said, \"The effects of this 'always on' culture are that your mind is never resting, and you're not giving your body time to recover, so you're always stressed. And the more tired and stressed we get, the more mistakes we make. Physical and mental health can suffer.\"\nAnd as the number of connected smart phones is increasing, so is the amount of data. This is leading to a sort of decision paralysis   and is creating more stress in the workplace because people have to receive a broader range of data and communications which are often difficult to manage. \"It actually makes it more difficult to make decisions and many do less because they're controlled by it all and feel they can never escape the office,\" said Dr Christine Grant.", "id": "high18998.txt"}
