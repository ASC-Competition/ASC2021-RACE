When I took it back, your employees accused me of tearing it myself. I left not only withm1, torn tent, but no refund  and no satisfaction.\nA  couple of weeks ago ,  I bought a sleeping bag that was supposed to sleep two people comfort-ably.  It didn't.  Your employees refused to give me my money back even though I had the receipt. I was asked to leave the store, again with no satisfaction.\nTo my misfortune, my latest purchase , of a piece of camping equipment at your store proyed to be another disappointment.  The propane    camp stove I bought didn't work properly. When I returned to exchange it, the rude clerk refused to help me because I did not have my sales receipt. It was an even exchange! He said that I was a problem and even asked if I had seen what products I-could purchase at one of your competitor's stores at comparable prices.  Was he accusing me of something? Why would I have brought a receipt for an even exchange? Why  would I know the price at other stores?\nFurthermore, the clerk called security and forced me to leave your store-without my camp stove! How can I go camping now? The tent leaks, the sleeping bag is just wrong, and I don't have a stove to keep warm ! Who is going to refund my money for my stove? Who is going to help me get over the abuse I suffered in your store?\nYou, as the area manager must clear these matters up for me immediately! I am sending copies of this letter to your main office and the Sierra Vista Store.\nSincerely ,\nIma Kumpanee", "id": "high9331.txt"}
