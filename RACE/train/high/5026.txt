While fans are standing in long queues to watch the first show, others are advocating a boycott on the American movie with Chinese story elements.\nAfter \"Kung Fu Panda\", a cartoon movie telling about a panda's Kung Fu master journey, hit China's silver screens in 2008, its sequel  , Kung Fu Panda 2, was released in China just ahead of International Children's Day, adding more Chinese elements such as shadow play   and lion dancing.\nHowever, some Chinese artists and scholars argue that the movie has twisted   Chinese culture and serves as a tool to \"kidnap  \" the mind of the Chinese people.\n\"Children's Day should be pure. Don't turn it into a money-making day for Hollywood, and don' t fool our next generation with American fast food,\" according to an open letter to Chinese cinema managers written by Zhao Bandi, an artist hoping to boycott the \"Americanized\" movie. His move is _ by Kong Qingdong, a professor of the Chinese language in Beijing University, who said Chinese elements have become advertising products to advocate American culture. \"It is a cultural invasion,\" said Kong.\nIn the movie, the main character called \"Po,\" a panda, is talkative, humorous, lovely, and is widely believed to be a typical American figure.\nHowever, the panda has won millions of fans in China. On China's most popular website, comments on the movie reached nearly 270 million entries.\n\"I won't call it a cultural invasion,\" said Li Jiayi, a Beijing university student. \"I see nothing bad for others to use our cultural elements to make a movie. I' m a huge fan of Po. In spite of being a cartoon, it is still loved by many adults like me,\" said the 25-year-old after watching the first show at midnight.\nCao Hui, general manager of Shenzhen Global Digital Creations company, said: \"instead of a\n'boycott', movie producers should learn from the movie to make better use of Chinese story elements. Technically, Kung Fu Panda is not more advanced than Chinese movies, but as for story telling skills, Chinese movies have a long way to go\".", "id": "high5026.txt"}
