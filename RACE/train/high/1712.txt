They were asked how many times they had moved as children, as well as about their psychological well-being, personality type and social relationships.\nThe researchers found that the more times people moved as children, the more likely they were to report lower life satisfaction and psychological well-being at the time they were surveyed. The research also showed that those who moved frequently as children had fewer quality social relationships as adults.\nThe researchers also looked to see if different personality types affected frequent movers' well-being. Among introverts, the more moves participants reported as children, the worse off they were as adults. \"Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to keep long-term close relationships.\" Said Oishi. \"This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily.\"\nThe findings showed neurotic people who moved frequently reported less life satisfaction and poorer psychological well-being than people who did not move as much and people who were not neurotic. However, the number and quality of neurotic people's relationships had no effect on their well-being, no matter how often they had moved as children. In the article, Oishi thinks this may be because neurotic people have more negative reactions to stressful life events in general.\n\"We can guess that moving often creates more stress,\" Oishi said. \"But we need more research on this link before we can conclude that moving often in childhood can, in fact, be dangerous to your health in the long-term.\"", "id": "high1712.txt"}
