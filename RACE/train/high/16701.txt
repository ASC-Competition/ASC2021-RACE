When we are asked if boys and girls can associate with each other, most of us will say, \"Yes, of course. Why not? \"\nIf we want to deal with the association between boys and girls properly, here are some tips for you to follow.\n1)Keep a normal and healthy state of mind  . Our schools and classes are made up of boys and girls. It is very natural for the boys and girls to contact  each other and build up the friendship with the students of the other sex. Generally speaking, we should broaden the circle of the association. We should make as many friends as possible. We should have more friends of the other sex instead of one or two. We should contact the students in public, not in secret.\n2)Contact students of the other sex warmly, generously and sincerely. Don't be too nervous or too shy in contact with a person of the other sex, because no one likes a person who is too shy to say a word.\n3)Don't fall into the ditch   of early love. The boys and the girls at adolescence   are rich in feelings and full of imagination . They are easy to regard the friendship as a sign of love and fall in love with each other at an early age. In my opinion, early love is a green apple that can't be eaten. An apple won't taste sweet until it is fully ripe . Do keep out of early love.", "id": "high16701.txt"}
