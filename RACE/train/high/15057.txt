The new girl Linda in class really liked him a lot. Paul was not happy about it.\nPaul's good friend, Sam, tried to comfort him.  \"What's the big deal? I think Linda is kind of cute and nice enough.\"\nPaul glared at Sam. \"Then why don't you ask her to be your girlfriend? There she is, sitting all by herself at the other end of the cafeteria. Go there and ask her to be your honey!\"\n\"She's crazy about you, not me,\" Sam replied.\n\"Well, I don't want any girlfriend, especially not a girl like her! \"Paul growled.\nSam wouldn't give up.  \"The only thing pesky about her is that she keeps writing you those notes .\"\n\"I don't like notes at all!\" Paul interrupted.
