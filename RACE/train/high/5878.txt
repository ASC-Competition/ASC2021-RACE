Inside as well as out,Hotel Portixol oozes style - wicker  sofas in a shade deck. Thoughtful extras include free bicycle hire and telescopes in each room.\n*Rooms\nThirteen of the 26 rooms have balconies,overlooking the sea. All have large showers and king-size beds. Our corner room had double glass doors on two sides which created a much-needed breeze.\n*Food\nBreakfast is a feast,with a huge selection of fresh fruit,yogurts,cereals,meats,cheeses and breads. The lunch and dinner menus mix traditional Mediterranean food with eastern and European classics.\n*Why Palma?\nParts of Majorca have a certain reputation,but calm,sweet Palma is a far shout from the island's busy and sometimes tacky  beach resorts so popular with hen and buck parties.\nThe Majorcan capital is also one of the easiest short-break destinations in Europe. The old town is a 10-minute taxi ride from Palma airport,while the tangled streets inside the old city wall combine the best restaurants,shopping and culture Majorca has to offer.\nWhile very hot in summer,temperatures remain pleasant during the rest of the year.\n*Getting there\nEasy Jet flies to Palma from most airports in the UK,from PS29.99 one way. A taxi from Palma airport to the city centre costs about PS8; or you can catch a bus which costs a few euros.", "id": "high5878.txt"}
