The i'm Watch, available since 2011, is the flagship product of an Italian company--i'm. This smart watch is an assist to the smart phone, with which it can communicate by Bluetooth wireless technology. It means you can leave your phone in your pocket as you answer or reject a call, review e-mails or read updates from friends on Twitter or Facebook.\nThe i'm Watch also has its own applications, such as i'm Sport, which links with a heart rate detector  to allow a runner to check his pulse. Such functions already exist in specialized sports watches but not on watches that are linked to smart phones.\nWith a square shape, a 3.8-centimeter touch screen and various color1s, the i'm Watch sells for a minimum of 300 Euros($390) for the basic model and prices climb to 16,000 Euros for a luxury model in silver or decorated with diamonds.\nSo far, the watch has already found 30,000 buyers, 80 percent of whom are men aged 25 to 50. \"Seventy percent are iPhone users, 25 percent Samsung and the rest are other telephones using Google's Android operating system,\" said Massimiliano Bertolini, a manager of the company, which aims to sell more than 200,000 watches this year. The company's target market is the person who is always glued to his smart phone, even in meetings or at the movies, or people who wish to keep an eye on their heartbeat during exercise. They will especially target women with advertisements emphasizing its design rather than its technology.", "id": "high18255.txt"}
