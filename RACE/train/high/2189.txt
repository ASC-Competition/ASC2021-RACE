I could not find a satisfying job. To my shame, I had to drive a school bus to make ends meet and lived in a friend's house.\nOne afternoon, while driving through a quiet suburban   neighborhood I was so sad that I kept asking myself \"Why has my life become so hard?\" \"What's wrong with the world?\" Then I pulled over the bus to drop off a little girl and as she passed she handed me a pretty earring, saying she found it on the floor of the bus and I should keep it in case the owner came to look for it.\nIn the evening, the owner did come to look for her earring. When I handed it to her, she got very excited and continued saying \"Thanks, you're a real gentleman.\" I told her that she should thank the little girl who had found it. She said, \"Yes, and you are a good driver, too. What a lovely world it is!\" Then she left with satisfaction. I was touched by her last words. I had thought something was wrong with the world just because of my poor condition. In fact, nothing was wrong with the world. I should change my attitude towards life. I should be positive about life.\nAt first it was hard, and then it got easier. Every day I could find things to make me happy. Then one night there was a phone call for me at my friend's house from a lady who was a manager in a large hospital. She said she had read my application form and asked me if I would like to work in the hospital. I said yes and got the job. Looking back at the experience I know the most important is to have a positive attitude towards life.", "id": "high2189.txt"}
