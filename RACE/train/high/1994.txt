All I wanted to do was to go home and enjoy a bowl of good hot soup.\nBut when I saw my daughter's car, _ Since his parents separated, I had tried to have my six-year-old grandson spend a few hours with me at least once a week. I had always tried to make it a special time for him. We did many interesting things; Bryan loved all these activities, and so did I. But today I had to give up our evening. I said how tired I was feeling. \"Bryan, I'm sorry. Tonight I don't feel like having fun or playing games. We'll have our night together some other time.\" I saw the sadness in Bryan's eyes. He said, \"I like soup, Grandma.\" I knew he meant \"Please don't send me away. Please let me stay.\" I saw the shadow   in Bryan's eyes. Something else was changing. Maybe he thought I wouldn't want to have him come any more -- not tonight, not next week, not ever. Finally, I said OK. I was glad to see his eyes light up. After I put the soup on the stove   and turned on the TV, I fell asleep.\nWhen I woke up, there was a coat over my legs, and the soup was gone. Bryan was on the floor, reading a coloring book and watching a television show at the same time. The poor boy must have been so bored  ! When he found I was awake, he ran over and gave me a big hug. \"I love you, Grandma,\" he said. \"Haven't we had a nice time together?\" His big smile and happy eyes told me that this time he meant exactly what he was saying. That was the keyword -- together. We had done nothing exciting or special. But we were together.", "id": "high1994.txt"}
