It was funded by the German and Dutch governments and the European Commission.\n\"While many good and useful claims are being made, it is clear that there is a long way to go in ensuring shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impacts they buy,\" said Consumers International director, Anna Fielder.\nThe 10-country study surveyed product packaging in Britain, Western Europe, Scandinavia and the United States. It found that products sold in Germany and the United Kingdom made the most environmental claims on average.\nThe report focused on claims made by specific products, such as detergent  , insect sprays and some garden products. It did not test claims, but compared them to labeling guidelines set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in September, 1999. Researchers documented claims of environmental friendliness made by about 2,000 products and found many too vague or too misleading to meet ISO standards.\n\"Many products had specially designed labels to make them seem environmentally friendly, but in fact many of these symbols mean nothing,\" said report researcher Philip Page.\n\"Laundry detergents made the most number of claims with 158. Household cleaners were second with 145 separate claims, while paints were third on our list with 73. The high numbers show how confusing it must be for consumers to sort the true from the misleading,\" he said.\nThe ISO labeling standards ban vague or misleading claims on product packaging, because terms such as \"environmentally friendly\" and \"non-polluting\" cannot be verified. \"What we are now pushing for is to have multinational corporations meet the standards set by the ISO,\" said Page.", "id": "high4406.txt"}
