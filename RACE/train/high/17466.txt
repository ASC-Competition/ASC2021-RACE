Some employed the most advanced technology ever.\nSome of the TVs used a new technology called Organic Light Emitting Diodes, or OLED. They were thinner, lighter, offered better color1 and were brighter than traditional LEDs. Smart TVs this year were smarter. Many offered technology that let users have a more personalized experience. One such TV from the electronics company TCL uses sensors and voice recognition to determine who is watching. It then offers programming based on the specific user. Another TV from Panasonic offers a similar personalized user experience.\nIn addition to television technology, size also played a major part in CES 2013. Televisions varied in size from big to bigger, with at least two companies -- Samsung and HiSense -- exhibiting TVs measuring 110 inches.\nThe yearly Consumer Electronics Show is the biggest technology trade show in North America and one of the biggest in the world.\nGary Shapiro is president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, the group that organizes CES. He gave one of the keynote speeches on opening day.\n\"Now you know that CES is more than a trade show. It's a gathering of the brightest minds and the top leaders from many industries and those seeking a glimpse into the future.\"\nThat glimpse into the future included a look at digital health and fitness devices, which were also big at CES 2013. There were devices that track your activity and others that measure blood pressure, heart rate and weight. There was even a fork that tells you when you are eating too fast.\nCars, smart-phones, tablet computers and PCs also made news. And a 27-inch table computer drew quite a bit of attention.\nCEA President Gary Shapiro says there was much to see but not nearly enough time to see it all. \"You cannot see the show in the four days that you have. We have over 3200 different industries showing over 20,000 new products. It's  ly incredible.\"", "id": "high17466.txt"}
