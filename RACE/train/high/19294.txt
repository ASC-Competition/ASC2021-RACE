But I don't. I'm still searching for it.\nOur friends are becoming grandparents. My kids are still in college, so this makes me feel younger than I am. I felt the same way in my 40s when my friends' kids were entering high school and I was attending Christmas shows at the elementary school. \"What do you mean you've never heard of Barney or the Rugrats?\" I'd ask. \nAt the age of 57, I find myself trying to find meaning at a time when some might think my best days are behind me. Each morning I wake with the intention of finding the sunshine in the day ahead.\nI am working temporary accounting jobs because that is the job I fell into many years ago, but I spend most of my time writing. When asked what I do for work, I find myself answering, I am a writer. I've published two novels, I blog, and I write pieces here on the Huffington Post, so yes, at 57 I can call myself a writer.\nAt this point in my life I realize Paul Bowles was correct when he said \"security is a false God\". What I am searching for at 57 are not possessions or money in the bank, for all those things can be lost in an instant. Job losses, illness, the loss of a loved one, all these things can and will rock that false sense of security.\nAt 57 I live with the choices and mistakes I have made, along with the curveballs that were thrown in my way. I accept the fact that there will always be more questions than answers. As at any age, the only true choice I have is how I deal with life's ups and downs but at 57 I have come to accept this. \nTime is my most precious commodity and I intend to make the most of it.", "id": "high19294.txt"}
