The demands of my work and my three children had made it possible to visit her only occasionally. That night I called to invite her to go out for dinner and a movie. She thought about it for a moment, and then agreed.\nThat Friday after work, I drove over to pick her up. When I arrived at her house, I noticed that she had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary. She smiled from a face that was as beautiful as an angel's.\nWe went to a very nice and comfortable restaurant. After we sat down, I had to read the menu. A smile was on her lips.\"It was I who used to have to read the menu when you -were a child,\" she said. \"Then it's time that you relax and let me return the favor,\" I responded.\nDuring the dinner we had an agreeable conversation-nothing special but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said,\"I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you.\" I agreed.\nA few days later my mother died of an unexpected heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. At that moment I understood the importance of saying \"I love you\" in time and giving our loved ones the time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more important than your family. Give them the time they deserve, because these things cannot be put off till \"some other time\".", "id": "high18967.txt"}
