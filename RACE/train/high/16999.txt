To play the violin well takes 10,000 hours of practice. How can we expect people to learn to be happy without large amounts of practice and repetition?\"\nIt is believed that at least two percent of British children under 12 now struggle with significant depression. Among teenagers, the figure rises to five percent. A UNICEF study involving 21 developed countries showed that British children were the least satisfied with their lives, while the World Health Organization predicts that childhood psychiatric   disorders will rise by 50 percent by 2020.\nIn a speech at Cambridge University, Lord Layard said the Government's lessons in manners did not go far enough. \"We need a commitment to producing a major specialism in this area, with a serious teacher training program,\" he said.\nHowever, happiness lessons have been criticized by academics. Frank Furedi, a sociology professor at Kent University and author of Therapy Culture, said: \"In pushing emotional literacy, what some teachers are really doing is abandoning teaching. They are giving up and talking about emotions instead, so that children value all this non-discipline-led activity more than maths, English or science. What is amazing about this is that time and time again, research says that it does not work.\"", "id": "high16999.txt"}
