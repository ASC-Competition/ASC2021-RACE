Much of the real significance of railroads and highways is not in their direct physical effect on the scenery, but in the ways that they affect the suurouding community. The same is true of big solar ppants and the power lines that will be laid dowm to move electricity around.\nThe 19\ncentury saw land grants offered to railroad companies to build the transcontinental railroads ,leaving public land in between privately owned land . In much of the west ,some of the railroad sections were developed while others remained undeveloped ,and in both cases the landownership has presented unique challenges to land management ,with the completion or the interstate highway system ,many of the small towns which sprang up as railway stops and developed well ,have lost their lifeblood and died .\nBig solar plants and their power lines will also have effects far beyond their direct footprint in the west .this is not an argument against building then ,we need alternative energy badly .and to really take advantage of it we need to be able to move electricity around far more readily than we can now .\nSo trade-offs will have to be made .some scenic sport will be sacrificed .some species  will be forced to move ,or will be carefully moved to special accommodations ,deals will be struck to reduce the immediate effects .\nThe lasting effects of these trade-offs are another matter .the 21\ncentury development of the American west as an ideal place for alternative energy is going to throw off a lot of power and money to do a lot of good .but it is just as likely that they will be spent wastefully and will leave new problems behind ,just like the railroad and the highway .\nThe money set aside in negotiated trade -offs and the institution that control  will shape the west far beyond the immediate footprint of power plants and transmission lines .so let's remember the effects of the railroad and the highways as we construct these new power plants in the west .", "id": "high15881.txt"}
