More than 100 people took part in the experiment, where participants watched Disney filmBig Hero 6in either standard format or RealD 3D.\nThey also carried out a brain-training-style test before and after seeing a section from the film. The test covered memory, reaction times and cognitive function and the results were compared later.\nAccording to the research, which was carried out in partnership with science group Thrill Laboratory, participants experienced a 23 percent increase in cognitive processing, as well as an 11 percent increase in reaction times.\nDr Fagan said that the results showed enough of an improvement in brain function to suggest that 3D could play a part in improving brain power in the future.\n\"These findings are more significant than you might think,\" he said. \"It is a fact that people are living longer and there is a noticeable decline in cognitive brain function in old age which can worsen future quality of life. There has never been a better time to look at ways to improve brain function. The initial results of this study show that 3D films may potentially play a role in slowing this decline.\"\nA second part of the experiment involved those watching the film being fitted with headsets that scanned brain activity and this too showed heightened   activity when watching 3D. According to the results, participants were seven percent more engaged with what they were watching, adding to argument that 3D movies are more like watching real-life--something Professor Brendan Walker from Thrill Laboratory agreed with.\n\"As Professor Brendan Walker's test concluded, 3D films are more attractive and heighten the senses -- this, in turn, makes the brain run at quicker speeds,\" Dr Fagan said.", "id": "high14907.txt"}
