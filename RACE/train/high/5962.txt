Just ignore her words. But remember: such a tough attitude cannot be used often.\"\nThese words are from a series of cartoons which outline skills for children to fight against their mothers. The images have created heated debate among Chinese netizens.\nRegarded as \"a book for children aged 6 to 12 who are always scolded by their parents\", the cartoons, drawn by two 10yearold Beijing girls, list over 20 skills which children can use to deal with their mothers' anger such as crying, pretending to be ashamed, fleeing into the toilet and pleasing her afterwards.\nEach skill is described with vivid pictures and humorous notes. The creativity of the young girls has amazed netizens, the Yangtse Evening Post reported on Thursday.\nAccording to one of the girls' mothers, her daughter once received a poor mark in an exam, and the mother blamed her and compared her performance with another classmate. The daughter's feelings led to her creating the cartoons.\nThe girl's father, who first posted the pictures on his Sohu Microblog on Monday, said he hopes parents pay close attention to the pictures, allow children to feel free to develop their own characteristics and try not to criticize them so often.\nThe father said the cartoons aren't finished yet; his daughter will continue with them when she has time.\n\"The cartoons, although an individual case, reflect a modern phenomenon and some of the problems within Chinese family education,\" said Yu Qinfang, an expert on family education.\nAccording to a survey of 104 children and their parents, Yu discovered that as many as 51.9 percent of primary school students hate being urged to do things by their mothers.\n\"Not giving children enough time and hurrying them to do things seems to be a very tiny detail within family life, but it is potentially a huge problem which can easily be ignored by parents. A mother's blame may lead to negative feelings within her child's heart,\" Yu said. \"Parents should learn to blame less and be more patient.\"", "id": "high5962.txt"}
