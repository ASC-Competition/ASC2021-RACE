While she was asked to play in her first World Cup in 2003, she largely remained on the bench after the first match.\nBut things have changed. Now, Han is one of the most important players in China's team. \"\n,\" Han always says like that.\nHan wants every possible honor that a football player can get -- an Asian Cup, a World Cup and an Olympic medal. She has always been good at sports, especially swimming and horizontal bars. At school, she was the fastest in the 60m and 100m.\nBut the reason she picked football was that she wanted to get more compliments  . \"Football is for boys. But I feel more fulfilled when I can do better than them and win more compliments,\" she said. Later, when she entered a football school, the coach always asked Han to show others what to do.\nHowever, nobody can be good at everything. Han described her singing as \"howling\" and the only school subject she was good at was Chinese. \"I was very happy every time my essay was posted on the wall for my schoolmates to read.\" But Han still has some regrets about her school years. Her handwriting was terrible at school. She ever wanted to improve her handwriting but didn't achieve much.\n\"My fans ask for my signature  , so I'd better practice and practice. It's not too late,\" she says.", "id": "high15533.txt"}
