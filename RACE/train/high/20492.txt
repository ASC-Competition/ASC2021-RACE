Clearly, childhood obesity must be solved urgently. But is it a good idea for mothers to put their daughters on diets?\nStudies show that the more children diet, the more likely they are to become obese as adults. Research also shows that girls are highly influenced by their mothers when it comes to eating habits and body image.\nThis was the case for Carly, 40, who blames her mother for her lifelong struggle with weight. \"My mother was on a diet the whole time I was growing up,\" she says. \"And she put me on my first diet when I was 10. I lost puppy fat, gained her approval and never ate normally again.\"\nAmerica's First Lady clearly has a vital healthy eating message to convey. But could this be damaging for Malia and Sasha? Could they develop eating disorders because of it?\n\"It's wrong just to blame mothers for their daughters' eating disorders,\" says Susan Ringwood, chief executive of the eating disorders charity. \"There is a genetic   component to eating disorders.\" However, \"We do know that parents have a very strong influence over a child's eating. It's important to realize that you are your daughter's role model. Girls idolize their mothers.\" says Ringwood.\n\"No food should ever be 'good 'or' bad',\" Ringwood says. Instead, \"You have to make it clear that food is a sociable, healthy and fun part of life, not something to be feared.\" \"Talk to her about body image,\" Ringwood says. \"Talk about how curves are an important and exciting part of being a woman. Show her that anorexic  ) fashion models are not sexy, but ill. The pressure on girls today is immense,\" she says. Never forget that you are the authoritative  voice, too.", "id": "high20492.txt"}
