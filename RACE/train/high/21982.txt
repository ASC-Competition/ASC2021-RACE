The pop superstar was taken to the University of California at Los Angeles medical centre last night, and doctors tried resuscitation (,) in the ambulance. He did not regain consciousness and was reported dead about three hours later.\n    \"My brother, the legendary King of Pop, passed away on Thursday 25 June at 2:26pm,\" his brother Jermaine said, \"We believe he suffered a cardiac arrest at his home, however the cause of his death is unknown until the results of the autopsy   are known. The personal physician who was with him at the time attempted to resuscitated him.\"\n    A spokesman for the UCLA medical centre said, \"When he arrived at hospital at approximately l:14pm, a team of doctors attempted to resuscitate him for a period of more than one hour, but they were unsuccessful.\" Police said they were investigating, which is the standard procedure in such cases.\n    Jackson's death brought a tragic end to a long decline from his peak in the 1980s when he was music's greatest all-around performer, a uniter of black and white music who shattered the race barrier on MTV. His 1982 album Thriller, which included the blockbuster hits Beat It, Billie Jean and Thriller is still the best-selling album of all time, with over 50m copies sold worldwide.\nThe world famous entertainer had planned a series of 50 concerts in London from 12 July. Although in the last two decades his reputation was destroyed by charges of child molestation   and his fantastic public behavior, all tickets were sold within hours, proving the King of Pop had enduring appeal.", "id": "high21982.txt"}
