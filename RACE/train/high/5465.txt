Every morning,Toto's water dish was filled with mud.The food bowl was tipped over and the porch scattered with mud and debris .\"I' ll bet it's a coon ,\"I told Kris.Though we live in a residential neighborhood not far from Portland,we' ve seen plenty of raccoons in the six years since we moved in.\nToday I got to see the cat-food thievery first-hand.Turns out it's not one raccoon-it's a family of four.I was lucky enough to have my camera handy as they performed their daring raid:My favorite part of this video is how Toto simply sits on her heating pad and watches the raccoons eat her food.She isn't bothered at all.", "id": "high5465.txt"}
