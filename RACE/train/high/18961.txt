But there are many ways of helping them even though you may not have a lot of money. One way is to buy their monthly magazines. By doing this one day, I got to know a young homeless man who was often standing at the train station, selling the magazine.\nHe was from another country and I can only imagine what kind of psychological scars   he must have had from living in a war-torn   country. After a while, I found that his birthday was close to mine which meant that we were born under the same sign of the Zodiac  . I met him last year shortly after his birthday, and without thinking, after congratulating him, I asked if he had had a good day. He said he hadn't really celebrated. I just couldn't bear the thought of this nice, young man being alone on his 25th birthday with no presents, no cakes and no songs!\nSo I went home and looked in my yarn                basket and as luck would have it, I had two yarn cores of pure wool left. I set to work and knitted a scarf for the young man.\nI ran into him on my own birthday the next year as I was going shopping. I had hoped to meet him so I had carried the scarf around with me and a piece of my own birthday cake. He was very happy with these gifts and so was I. The light in his eyes and the heartfelt hug   he gave me was the best present he could have given me!", "id": "high18961.txt"}
