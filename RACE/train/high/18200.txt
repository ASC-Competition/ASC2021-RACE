I have many useful easy methods for earning easy money while we all spend our useful time on the Internet by surfing, chatting, downloading and other work. There is no need to stop any other work. We can earn with or without our daily routine. Here I tell you the complete method for online earning.\nFirst Method\nEarn money with \"Bux. to\". You can earn money through \"Bux. to\" by clicking on ads on \"Bux. to\" site. First you need to poen an account at \"Bux. to\".\n\"Bux. to\" is a new international and FREE English based service that allows advertisers to reach thousands of potential customers by displaying their ads on our \"Surf Ads\" page. An exact calculated percentage of all advertising income is paid to our members. \"Bux. to\" makes money through advertising.\nHow you make money\nYou view websites in 30 seconds through the \"Surf Ads\" page. Once the 30 seconds is up, you'll either get a green tick   sign or a red \"x\". The green tick sign means you've earned $0.01 and the \"x\" means you have not earned money for the visit. You'll get redxs when you have more than one website from the \"Surf Ads\" page open. When this happens, you get no credit.\nEarnings example\nYou click 10 ads per day=$ 0.10\n20 referrals   click 10 ads per day=$2.00\nYour daily earnings=$ 2.10\nYour weekly earnings=$14.70\nYour monthly earnings= $63.00\nHow to get paid\nIf you have at least $10.00 accumulated, you can click on your account balance within your state's area and it will meet your request.
