Somebody left the garden gate open. Johnny wandered out, crossed some fields, and two hours later, and arrived in the next village. He was just able to give his name and address.\nBy the time he was seven, Johnny used to vanish from home two to three times a year. Sometimes he covered quite long distances on foot. On other occasions he got on a bus or even a train, and simply sat there until someone asked for his ticket. Generally the police brought him home. \"Why do you do it?\" they used to ask. \"You aren't unhappy at home, are you? .... \"\"Of course not,\" Johnny replied.\" Then why?\" \"I just like seeing places,\" Johnny told them.\nJohnny continued to \"see places\" although everyone tried to stop him. His parents used to watch him closely, and so did his teachers; but sooner or later Johnny managed to slip away. As he grew older, his favorite trick was to hide on a long distance truck. Sometimes he used to travel hundreds of miles before anyone discovered him.\nIt is hardly surprising that eventually Johnny managed to get on board a plane. He was twelve at the time. It was a cargo plane and, a few hours later, Johnny found himself in Cairo. How did he get on board? No one knows! According to Johnny himself, it was easy: he just went into the airport, walked along some corridors and got on board the nearest plane.\nIn spite of all this, Johnny did well at school. He enjoyed maths and languages and, perhaps not surprisingly, he was especially good at geography. \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" his teachers asked him. Johnny did not take long to answer that question. \"An explorer!\" he answered. \"But it's difficult to become an explorer in this modern age.\" they tried to tell him, But it was no use: Johnny knew what he wanted!\nJust before he left school, Johnny saw a notice in one of the daily papers. An expedition was about to go to Brazil to travel up the Amazon River. There were vacancies(,) for three young people \"willing to work hard and with a sense of adventure\". Johnny applied, and, one month later, he was on his way to Brazil.", "id": "high19134.txt"}
