Selling educational toys should be easy.\nWhile China may be the world's biggest toymaker, many of the best are exported . Department stores here do not have enough high quality toys. It is said that the demand for educational toys is low.\nA US company, BabyCare, is trying to change that with a new way to sell toys in China.\nBabyCare works basically together with doctors in Beijing hospitals.  People who join the company's \"mother club\"can get lectures and newsletters on baby and child development at no extra cost, if they agree to spend 18 dollars a month on the company's educational toys and childcare books.\n\"We want to build a sevenyear relationship with those people,\" said Matthew J. Estes, BabyCare's president. \"It starts during pregnancy , when the anxiety and needs are highest.\" BabyCare works on a onetoone basis. Doctors, nurses, and teachers paid by BabyCare advise parents, explain toys that are designed for children at each stage of development to age six.\nBabyCare opened its first store in China last June in a shopping center in central Beijing and another near Beijing Zoo. It plans to have 80 stores in China within six years.\nIt is a new model for China and develops a market in young children's education and health that no other companies are in.", "id": "high15210.txt"}
