I can share a bit about my history with money and my new view when it comes to using _ \nI made a web page with links to posts about our financial journey where you can look for more details of where we've been and how we got where we are now. It was a big part of my story in the past and was a huge part of our downsizing journey. We got out of debt and stayed out of debt.\nSo I feel eager to share the benefits of being on this side. It takes planning and more careful thought whenever a dollar is spent now than it did when I had a wallet full of credit cards. I now like to think all of my dollars having a job. So many of us work for money and don't consider that money should work for us, too. Make your dollars do the job of helping you live the life you want.\nEach time money is spent or saved, it should be going toward something that you purposefully want for your life. Last week I was out and I spent $20 on food in 3 days. It made me angry because afterward I thought about eating is not at all what for my life.\nOn the other hand, there are times I spend $20 while out with my family and it doesn't bother me one bit. An afternoon out with my kids during which we stop for ice cream, and do something fun together has a completely different feel to it.\nIn the end, I want the dollars I spend to have purpose like I can enjoy life while still planning and saving for the future.", "id": "high6577.txt"}
