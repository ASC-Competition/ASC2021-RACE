Like any other\nconstantly repeated action, speaking has to be learned, but once it is learned, it becomes a generally\nunconscious and apparently automatic process.\nAs far as we can determine, human beings do not need to be forced to speak; most babies seem to possess a\nsort of instinctive drive to produce speech like noises. How to speak and what to say are another matter\naltogetner. There actions are learned from the particular society into which the baby is born; so that, like all\nconduct that is learned from a society--from the people around us--speech is a patterned activity.\nThe meandering babble and chatter of a young child are eventually channeled by\nimitation into a few orderly grooves that represent the pattern accepted as meaningful by the people around\nhim. Similarly, a child's indiscriminate practice of putting things into his mouth becomes limited to putting food into his mouth in a certain way.\nThe sounds that a child can make are more varied and numerous than the sounds that any particular language uses. However, a child born into a society with a pattem of language is encouraged to make a small selection of sounds and to make these few sounds over and over until it is natural for him to make these\nsounds and not others.", "id": "high15334.txt"}
