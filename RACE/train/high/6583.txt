Kennedy--sat down, as a frontrunner for the Senate seat in New York, for a televised interview that helped decide the future of her campaign. The result was a disaster.\nHer performance wasn't well received, in part because her speech was full of filler words--\"ums,\" \"ahs\" and \"you knows.\" One listener counted 27 \"ums\" and 38 \"you knows\" in the space of five minutes. A few weeks after the interview, Kennedy ended her Senate campaign.\nFiller words may seem natural in everyday speech, but they can be deadly in formal presentations. \"Using excessive fillers is the most annoying speech habit,\" said Susan Ward, a speech specialist. \"They take your listener's attention away often to the point that he doesn't hear anything you say. Your message is entirely lost.\"\nMany speakers are afraid of pause. They believe their audience will think they are inarticulate   if they pause to think of what to say next, so they use filler words to avoid the silence. However, a pause is actually more impressive than a filler word. Listeners know that the speaker is thinking, trying to find the right word. Sometimes a pause can actually improve a speech, as when an actor uses a dramatic pause to hold the attention of his audience. A speaker shouldn't be afraid to pause occasionally during a speech; it shows self-confidence.\nIt takes some work to cut out filler words. You can begin by taking a few seconds to think about what you want to say the next time you are asked a question. This pause will help you begin powerfully, and it will help you avoid using a filler word.\nThe same public speaking technique applies when you are shifting from one idea to another. While you may be tempted to fill the silence between ideas with a filler word, remember to allow yourself to pause and think about what you want to say next.\nIf you need help overcoming your \"um\" problem, consider asking a family member or a friend to point out when you use filler words. You also could record an upcoming presentation and then watch yourself in action. You may be amazed at how often you say \"um\" or \"uh\"!\nAlthough we live in a fast-paced society that seemingly demands instant answers, we must use the pause to our advantage. Finally, we should only speak when we are ready.", "id": "high6583.txt"}
