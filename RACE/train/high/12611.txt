Genetic variation in KLOTHO could help us predict brain health and find ways to protect people from the diseases that happen to us as we grow old, like Alzheimer's disease ,\" said senior author, Dena Dubal of University of California.\nThe KLOTHO gene affects a protein found in the kidneys and the brain that regulates many different body processes. About one in five people carry a single copy of the varian, known as KL-VS,which boosts levels of the protein and is associated with a longer lifespan and improved heart and kidney function. A small minority, 3% of the population, has two copies, which is linked to a shorter lifespan.\nIn the new study scientists scanned the brains of 422 men and women aged 53 and over who were also tested for the KLOTHO gene. They found that participants with a single copy of the gene variant also had a larger brain region known as RDLPFC, which is especially likely to shrink with age. Loss of neurons in this area may be one reason why older people are sometimes easily distracted and find it difficult to do more than one task at the same time.\nResearcher Dr Jennifer Yokoyama said, \" The brain region enhanced by genetic variation in KLOTHO is vulnerable in aging and some mental disease. In this case, bigger size means better function. It will be important to determine whether the structure increase associated with carrying one copy of KL-VS can _ the cognitive shortage caused by disease.\"[:]\nPeople who have one copy of a variant KL-VS tend to live longer and have lower chances of suffering a stroke  ,whereas people who have two copies may live shorter lives and have a higher risk of stroke.", "id": "high12611.txt"}
