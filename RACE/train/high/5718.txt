I was eager to start, but something made me stop.\n\"What is an environmental issue?\" one kid asked. \"What if we don't care about the environment?\" another complained. \"It's not like it affects me.\"\nThese comments _ me. I have always cared about the environment and assumed that others did too. From the surprised look on my teacher's face, I could tell she felt the same way.\nIn no time, I finished my essay. In my essay I wrote about logging , which is an important industry, but if we continue to cut down trees without replacing, it will damage the environment.\nThere are so many things that we can do to save our world. Recycling, of course, is always a good thing, but not everyone has a recycling plant nearby (I don't). There are other ways to help the environment. Plant a tree. Don't waste water.\nI can't stand it when a person's excuse for not caring is \"Nothing is going to happen in my lifetime, so why should I care?\" Sure, the chances of something terrible happening are slim, but I want people to realize that if we don't deal with it, someone will have to eventually. Do you want that to be your children? Or your children's children?\nWhen my teacher told me to read my essay to my class, I was a little embarrassed because I didn't want everyone to call me \"tree-hugger\". I realize now that if being a tree-hugger means you care about the environment, I'm a tree-hugger 100 percent. I just wish more people were.", "id": "high5718.txt"}
