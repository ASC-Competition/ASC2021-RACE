Evolution may have developed women's preference for pink, perhaps because it helped to find ripe fruit and healthy men with reddish faces, while both men and women have a natural desire for blue, according to scientists at prefix = st1 /NewcastleUniversity.\n\" Everyone in today's western culture, from parents to toy manufactures, seems to assume that little girls like pink.\" Said Prof. Anya Hulbert, who wanted to find out whether the reason was cultural or to do with biology.\nA love of salmon,  _ and coral does seem to be rooted into females, rather than picked up from their mothers.\nThe participants in the study were Chinese and British. The Chinese students showed a marked preference for red, \" Culture may contribute to this natural female preference,\" said Pro.

Hulbert and her colleague Dr. Yazhu Ling marked the results and found that while men preferred blue, women tended to choose pink.\nHulbert said she could only prefer about the preference for blue: \" Here again, I would favor evolutionary arguments. Going back to our savannah days, we would have a natural preference for a clear blue sky, because it signaled good weather. Clear blue also signals a good water source.\"", "id": "high23661.txt"}
