I take on too many projects at once, and spend too much of my time doing things I'd rather not be doing. I get stuff done, but it's not always the best I can do, or the best way I could spend my time.\nThat's why my newest goal, both as a professional and a person, is to be a quitter.\nBeing a quitter isn't being someone who gives up, who doesn't see important things through to the end. I desire to be the opposite of that. The quitter I want to be is someone who gets out when there's no value in what he's doing, or when that value comes at the expense of something more important.\nWe get involved in something, realize we don't want to be a part of it, but keep on going. We say \"Well, I've already invested so much time in this, I might as well stick it out.\" A friend of mine once told me, \"I knew I was an adult when I could stop reading a book, even after getting 500 pages into it.\" Odd though it sounds, we all tend to do this.\nI propose the opposite: quit as often as possible, regardless of project status or time invested. If you're reading a book, and don't like it, stop reading. Cut your losses, realize that the smartest thing to do is stop before your losses grow even more, and quit. Instead of reading an entire book you hate, read half of a bad one and half of a good one. Isn't that a better use of your time?\nStep back for a second. Let's learn how to say \"no\" at the beginning, or in the middle, and free up more of our time to do the things we'd like to be doing, and the things actually worth doing.\nSaying no is hard, and admitting a mistaken yes is even harder. But if we do both, we'll start to make sure that we're spending our time creating value, rather than increasing our losses. Let's be quitters together.", "id": "high194.txt"}
