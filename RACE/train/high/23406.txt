It allows scientists to identify specific genes, to remove them from an organism's chromosomes  , improve them, analyze them, and possibly clone them, and to then reinsert the changed gene into the original organism, or a completely different organism.Unlike traditional breeding  , where a desired quality would be bred within the same species,  genetic engineering can insert desired ones into organisms of different species.Wow...Did you catch that?\n     Genetic engineering creates many positive contributions to agriculture. For example, by genetically engineered(GE) foods,  anti-cancer agents,  minerals and vitamins can be increased.Improved taste,  shelf life, and better transport are all possible.Also, GE plants can increase pest and bacterial resistance, therefore, making the food safe for consumers.\n    But some argue that the possible negative effects outweigh the positives, and critics are starting to voice their concerns.  Unlike Europe, in the United States labeling is not required on genetically engineered foods or on foods that contain genetically engineered products. Most Americans do not realize that they are, in fact, eating GE foods.\n    The public is also concerned about the unknown health risks.With limited understanding of genes, scientists cannot predict possible effects.Because most genes introduced into GE plants come from sources not introduced into the human body,  it is impossible to know if they will cause reactions. Moreover, due to  _ if allergies develop, it will be extremely difficult to find the origin of them.\n    There is also a major moral question in many minds.For many,  the conflict is not if it is safe or not, but it disturbs them because it is unnatural and unnecessary.We are currently producing one and a half times the amount of food needed to feed the world, yet one in seven people are starving.GE food is unnecessary, and fails to address the root of hunger. Many believe that the only people who will benefit are the corporations that produce it.\n     Scientists cannot foresee t.he possible effects of GE foods, yet we eat them every day without even knowing it.We already have enough food, so why create more that could be potentially harmful to us, to the Earth and to all wildlife? I think that the benefits are amazing, but until we know for sure how these foods will affect us, they are not worth the risk.", "id": "high23406.txt"}
