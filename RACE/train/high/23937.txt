Along with a sizable pay raise, people chosen as managers would begin a nearly automatic climb up the career ladder to successful executive private benefits: company cars, club memberships, plus the key to the executive washroom. \nBut in today's global and more competitive showground, a manager sits in an insecure  chair. More companies has begun to take less  management as they come to view their organizations as collections of talents rather than hierarchies  . There are far fewer steps for managers to climb. Also, managerial jobs demand more hours and headaches than ever before but offer slim, if any financial paybacks and perks. \nNow managers must manage many people who are spread over different locations, even over different continents. They must manage across functions with, say, design, finance and marketing. \nIn many companies, when the most praised people in business are those launching something new, management seems like an invisible, thankless role. Employers are looking for people who can do things, not for people who make other people do things. \nMoreover it may not pay to be a manager, at least not the way it once did. Ms. Chmielewski says, \"The emotional rewards can be great, and there were times when I enjoyed management. But a 10-to-11-hour day and one weekend day a month is the norm  \". \nWith more people cautious of joining management, are companies being hurt or worrying about developing future leaders? Not many are. While employers have fired a lot of managers, they believe many more candidates linger on at many companies. \"Another reason why companies aren't short of managers,\" argues Robert Kelley, a business professor, \"is that so many workers today are self-managed, either individually or via teams, they don't need a manager.\"", "id": "high23937.txt"}
