Zhao lei, a software engineer in Beijing, loves the one-hour lunch break at noon, as it is the best time for him to check \"today's special\" at his favorite group buying websites . Sometimes he searches for great deals at directory sites devoted to the new shopping space. Zhao spends around 800 yuan ($117.65) on group buying every month, mostly to buy food coupons  for eating at some nice restaurants and occasionally to find something fun to do. ''I love group buying. In addition to the competitive discounts it offers, it helps me get something fun, exciting and new, and such surprises give me a reason to try something new,\" he said. When he finds a really good bargain, he will send the link to friends or colleagues through MSN,QQ, or e-mail, or share the information at some social networking websites.
