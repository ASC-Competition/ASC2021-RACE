The chip can be placed into a cell phone, a PDA, an MP4, a digital camera or even a laptop. He said that this, together with plans by China's state broadcaster, would ensure the 2008 Games lives up to its promise as a \"People's Olympics\".\n\"Our chips are cheap so that cell phones with them will not be much different in price from regular phones,\" Meng said. \"CCTV will offer some free channels during the Games, so people can enjoy the Olympics for free.\"\nSARFT  is planning to build a regional test network in Beijing and hopes to start trials as soon as possible. The goal is to deploy CMMB   on a national level by the first half of 2008.\nInnofidei is now busy selling their chips to cell phone makers so that the new generation of phones reaches the market in early 2008.\n\"Our invention successfully combines the good points of the two best-selling consumer products in history--TV sets and cell phones, \" said Meng. \"In the near future, soccer fans won't be tearing their hair out because they are stuck in traffic and missing the chance to see their favorite team's play.\"\nLocal baseball fans, meanwhile, will be able to draw comfort from the knowledge that--both at the Olympics and afterwards--their teams will be playing on a field designed to help recycle water.", "id": "high8405.txt"}
