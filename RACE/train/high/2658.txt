Here are some ways to master it.\nRecite and repeat in conversation.\nWhen you hear a person's name, repeat it. Immediately say it to yourself several times without moving your lips. You could also repeat the name in a way that does not sound forced or artificial.\nAsk the other person to recite and repeat.\nYou can let other people help you remember their names. After you've been introduced to someone, ask that person to spell the name mad pronounce it correctly for you. Most people will be pleased by the effort you're making to learn their names.\nAdmit you don't know.\nAdmitting that you can't remember someone's name can actually make people relaxed. Most of them will feel sympathy if you say. \"I'm working to remember names better. Yours is right on the tip of my tongue. What is it again?\"\nUse connections.\nLink each person yon meet with one thing you find interesting or unusual. For example, you could make a mental note: \"Vicki Cheng -- tall, black hair.\" To reinforce your associations, write them on a small card as soon as possible.\nLimit the number of new names you learn at one time.\nWhen meeting a group of people, concentrate on remembering just two or three names. Free yourself from remembering every one. Few of the people in mass introductions expect you to remember their names. Another way is to limit yourself to learning just first names. Last names can come later.\nGo early.\nConsider going early to conferences, parties and classes. Sometimes just a few people show up on time. There're fewer names for you to remember. And as more people arrive, you can hear them being introduced to others --- an automatic review for you.", "id": "high2658.txt"}
