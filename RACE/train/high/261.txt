He would sometimes go to the cinema for the same film four or five times. He also enjoys literature and art. Before he took the film acting as his career,he had worked in an airline in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan Province. His change of job to acting was quite by chance.\nOne day,he came across in the paper an advertisement for a leading actor to appear in the film named \"Wedding Feast.\" Full of excitement,he answered the job ad by telephoning the director of the film -- Mr. Li An. It was this telephone call that had changed all his life. At last the director decided him to be the very person for the role. That he could be chosen owed much to his good command of English,natural manners and low pay for his work in the film.\nThe film \"Wedding Feast\" proved to be a hit. It won the German Golden Bear Award and entered the competition for one of the Oscar Academy Awards. Also, it was the first Taiwan film that was permitted to be shown in the U. S. Thanks to the film,Zhao Wenxuan became popular in Taiwan, Hong Kong and southeast Asia.\nIn 1994,Mr. Zhao acted as a leading role in the Hong Kong film,\"Red Rose and White Rose\",in which many film stars like Ms Chen Chong from U. S. and Ms Ye Yuqing from the local area participated. This film was named for 10 prizes of the Taiwan Golden Horse Prize and at last it was awarded five prizes for the best play,actress and music. Zhao has regarded the film as one of his favorite films since he stepped into the acting circle.\nSince 1993,Mr. Zhao has taken part in the shootings of 13 films, most of which are thought highly of.\nMr. Zhao said the that Taiwan should think to cooperate much with the mainland in the film producing industry and it would benefit each other. In recent years he often came to the mainland for film shooting. He has just completed his performance in the film \"Love Affairs\" directed by Mr. LiXin,a director from Shanghai Film Studio.", "id": "high261.txt"}
