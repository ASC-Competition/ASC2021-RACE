They'll help with everything from losing weight to protecting your heart.\nYour daily calorie needs\nThis is not technically a measurement, but it can have a huge influence on your health. Most women need 2,000 calories a day for good health, and men generally need about 2,550. One way to work out your daily calorie needs is to multiply   your weight in pounds by 13 to 15, depending on your activity level. But roughly, that's 300 to 400 calories for breakfast, 500 to 600 for lunch, and 600 to 700 for dinner. Trying to lose weight? Eat about 500 calories less.\nYour waist size\nWaist size is one of the best ways to measure whether your weight is affecting your heart health. When body fat is packed into your abdomen  ,your risk of heart attack increases. For women, health risk begins to rise when your waist is more than 35 inches. For men, risk increases with a measurement when your waist is over 40 inches.\nYour blood pressure\nBlood pressure rises and falls normally during the day. When it remains high, you have high blood pressure and this carries a higher risk or heart disease and stroke.\nA reading of 140/90 mm Hg or more is considered high, and if it's between 120/80 and 139/89, you may still be at risk and should be taking steps to prevent the development of high blood pressure.\nYour morning pulse rate\nYour pulse rate is the number of times your heart beats in one minute. A normal resting pulse rate is 60 to 90 beats per minute. People who are fit tend to have lower resting pulse rates because their heart muscles are in good shape. But if you don't exercise regularly and your heart rate is lower than the normal range, tell your doctor--it could be a sign of heart disease.", "id": "high24060.txt"}
