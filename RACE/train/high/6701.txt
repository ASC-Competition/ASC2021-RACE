The Bluefin 21 submarine can create a sonar map of the area to chartany wreckage on the seafloor.\nThe move comes after crews picked up a series of underwater sounds over the past two weeks that were consistent with an aircraft's black boxes.\n\"We haven't had a single detection in six days, and l guess it's time to go under water,\" said Houston.\n\"Analysis of the four signals has reduced the search area on the ocean floor. The experts have therefore determined that the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield will stop searching with the Towed Pinger Locator later today and use the underwater vehicle Bluefin 21 as soon as possible,\" he said at a news conference in Perth.\n _ \nHe said the submarine will take 24 hours to do each task, including two hours to dive, 16 hours to search the bottom, then two more hours hack up and four hours to download data.\nRecovering the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders is necessary For investigators to try to figure out what happened to Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8.\nHouston said the search using the submarine will be a slaw and painstaking process.\nThe submarine takes six times longer to cover the same area as the pinger locator,and will need about six weeks to two months to examine the present underwater zone. The signals are also coming from 4,500 meters (15,000 feet) below the surface, which is the deepest the submarine can dive.", "id": "high6701.txt"}
