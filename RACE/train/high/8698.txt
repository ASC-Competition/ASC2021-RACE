A short time ago, a test   was given in the United States. People of different ages, from 12 to 83, were asked to have a test. During the test, these people were given all kinds of breakfast, and sometimes they got no breakfast at all. Scientists   wanted to see how well their bodies worked when they had eaten different kinds of breakfast.\nThe results show that if a person eats a right breakfast, he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast. If a student has fruit, eggs, bread and milk before going to school, he or she will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class. The result is opposite to what some people think. Having no breakfast will not help you lose weight  . This is because people become so hungry at noon that they eat too much for lunch. They will gain weight   instead of losing it. You will lose more weight if you reduce your other meals.", "id": "high8698.txt"}
