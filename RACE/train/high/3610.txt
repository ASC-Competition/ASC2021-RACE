No notebooks, no textbooks, no test papers. Nor are there any pencils or pens, which always seems to _ . A \"paperless classroom\" is what more and more schools are trying to achieve .\nStudents don't do any handwriting in this class . Instead , they use palm size , or specially--designed computers. The teacher downloads texts from Internet libraries and sends them to every student's personal computer. Having computers also means that students use the Web. They can look up information on any subject they're studying from maths to social science.\nHigh school teacher Judy Herrell in Florida, US, described how her class used the Web to learn about the war in Afghanistan over one year ago. We could touch every side of the country through different sites from the forest to refugee camps, she said .\"Using a book that's three or four years old is impossible.\"And exams can go on line too.
