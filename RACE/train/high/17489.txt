If the driver beats the ticket,they pay Fixed 25%of what it would have cost.\n\"When you mention parking tickets to people,most people think they've received an unfair one,\"said David Hegarty,the designer of Fixed,who came up with the idea after getting six parking tickets in one day.\nWhen someone gets a ticket,they snap a photo of it on their iPhone and enter the code.The app will tell them what percentage of those types of tickets are usually overturned and then show a list of possible reasons it could be found wrong such as a traffic sign covered by a leafy tree or a broken parking meter.If the motorists think they have a case,the app will remind them to get any additional photographic evidence with their phone and then digitally sign a letter.\nFixed's business model isn't completely new.There are companies that handle such cases for large companies such as FedEx and UPS.The difference is that Fixed is making the service available to individuals,thus helping in any area where the fee amount is small enough not to protest in person,but still big enough to make someone angry.\"That's our sweet spot,\"David said.", "id": "high17489.txt"}
