Helen Fry's new book Quick Cookinghas been specially written for busy people. It has over 1,000 recipes, from the famous Spanish gazpacho to Swedish smorgasbord. The book is well written and the photographs and drawings are clear. (They are like those in the excellent littleQuick DressmakingandQuick Gardening.) The book has a strong plastic cover. It is easy to find your way around it too. And busy people, notice this, Mrs Fry tells you how much time you need in order to get each dish ready.\nQuick Cooking has four parts, one for each season. This helps you to use fresh fruit and vegetable when they are cheaper--and, of course, better. There are a lot of exciting ideas from foreign countries, and most of the recipes are easy to follow. You take something simple like a chicken or some cheese, and make an unusual dish out of it. For example, there are no fewer than 40 recipes for eggs! Mrs Fry does not plan complete meals for the \"quick book\". The beginners will have to find out a lot of things for himself or herself. But this ought to be difficult with such a good book. I wanted to try many of the recipes as soon as I read them. For people with little spare time, Helen Fry's Quick Cooking is excellent value.", "id": "high20747.txt"}
