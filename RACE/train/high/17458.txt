The rain was pouring on the car roof as Albert and Andy drove through the empty country roads towards their friends' house, the Harrisons,where they were going to attend a party to celebrate the engagement of the Harrisons' daughter,Lisa. When they drove, they listened to the local radio giving a news announcement:The New York police have issued a warning after a man escaped from Shangdi Mental Hospital earlier this morning .The man ,John, is a murderer who killed six people.\nAndy felt frightened, \"A crazy killer is out somewhere.\" \"Don't worry about it ,\" said her husband. \"We're nearly there now. Anyway, we have more important things to worry about. This car is losing power for the engine.\" As he spoke, the car began to slow down. Finally the engine died completely. \"Now we'll have to walk in the rain.\" \"But that'll take us an hour at least,\" said Andy, \"And I have my high-heeled shoes and my nice clothes on, which will be ruined!\"  \"Well, you'll have to wait while I run to the nearest house and call the Harrisons. Someone can come out and pick us up,\"said George. \"But George! Have you forgotten what the radio said? There's an insane person out there!\" \"You'll have to hide in the back of the car. Lock all the doors and lie on the floor in the back. When I come back, I'll knock three times on the door. Then you can open it.\" Albert opened the door and disappeared into the darkness.\nSome time later she heard the sound of vehicles, running quickly down the road. The three vehicles were all police cars. One of them rushed towards the car as Andy opened the door. A policeman said, \"Get out of the car and walk. You're safe now. Just don't look back.\" something in the way he spoke filled Andy with cold horror. About ten yards from the police car, she stopped , turned and looked back at the empty vehicle. Albert was hanging from the tree, a rope tied to his neck.", "id": "high17458.txt"}
