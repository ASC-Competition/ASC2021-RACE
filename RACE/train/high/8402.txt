The evidence is on their side: Men are 3.4 times more likely than women to get a ticket for careless driving and 3.1 times as likely to be punished for drunk driving. \"Women are on average less aggressive and more law abiding   drivers, which leads to fewer accidents,\" the report says. However, not all male drivers share the same opinion. Of the men surveyed by MetLife, 39% claimed male drivers were safer. The findings did back them upon one point: automotive knowledge. The report showed that more men are familiar with current safety equipment such as electronic stability control,which helps prevent rollover accidents.\nAuto safety unavoidably matters to Money.

Among individual states, women get the greatest, advantage in Wyoming (where they pay 20% less), South Dakota and Washington, D.C, where their insurance costs are 16% lower.\n\"More than 11,900 male drivers died in US traffic accidents in 2009,compared with just under 4,900 women drivers\" according to the study. \"Based on miles traveled, men died at a rate of 2.5 deaths per 100 million miles traveled, vs.1.7 deaths for women.\"", "id": "high8402.txt"}
