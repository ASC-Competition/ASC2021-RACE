It has the atmosphere of a student party in an old building that might soon be knocked down.\nRoncs is owned by Hungary's best-known heavy metal rock band, Tankcsapda. Sometimes referred to as the \"Hungarian Metallica\", the band has taken a type of music that is famous worldwide and-through lyrics, album covers, and an annual New Year's party and concert-made it all about their home city.\nIt's perhaps fitting that Tankcsapda should be seen as ambassadors for Debrecen-the city sometimes needs loud heavy metal rock music to get noticed. \"Foreigners think that Hungary is Budapest and there's nothing else,\" is a familiar saying on Debrecen's[:streets.\nDebrecen has, at times, been more important than the current seat of power, with locals claiming it takes over in times of trouble.\nThat doesn't quite add up.\nDebrecen survived an attack from the Mongols in the 13th century, the Black Death, 150 years of struggle against the Ottomans and numerous conflicts, and yet it[:has still only briefly been the country's capital twice. This happened for the first time after a short-lived revolution in 1849, and for a second time at the end of World War II.\nToday, Debrecen may not be well known to tourists, but that only adds to the charm of this relaxed city. It's a small place; the historical center is sized for strolling   and regular cafe stops. There's also a view of Debrecen's mix of architectural styles, a result of the frequent large fires that back in the 19th century led the city's\nstudents to form one of Europe's first-ever fire brigades  .\nYou can also see traditional _ from the rooftops, featuring Islamic star and crescent moon symbols that once advertised to Ottoman invaders that the city preferred trading to fighting.\nTrade meant that Debrecen's skilled people became very successful and the city became famous for-among other things-fine foods, hats and clay pipes. In the early 19th century, 10 million clay pipes were reportedly made a year, with thousands bought for Britain's navy.", "id": "high13674.txt"}
