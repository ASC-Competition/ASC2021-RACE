Is there a better way to learn how to communicate effectively? Yes, there is. Please follow the 3 basic steps below.\n1. Relax and Breathe.\nWhether it's a business meeting or the first date, the first thing you must do in order to communicate is to relax. When you relax you are in control. You control your reactions and your reactions do not control you. Breathing is central to relaxation. Take a few deep breaths and your body will begin to be more at ease. This will help you apply what you already know about how to communicate well.\n2. Think and you will be prepared.\nHave you ever heard the old saying, \"think before you speak\"? Well, it is true. By thinking ahead about how the conversation might flow, you will be better prepared, more at ease and more confident.\n3. Follow the flow of the conversation.\nIf you are uncomfortable, being silent will only make it worse and make the other person uncomfortable as well. So when all else fails, follow through with small talk until a common topic appears.\nA good way to keep a conversation going is to ask the other person questions. People love to talk about themselves and if you do this they will think very highly of you.\n. If you make an effort, you will succeed.", "id": "high15770.txt"}
