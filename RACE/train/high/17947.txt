Antiques are old. You are my antique.\" \nI am not satisfied to let the matter rest there. I explain, \"An antique is not only just old; it's an object existing since or belonging to earlier times such as a work of art or a piece of furniture. Antiques are valuable.\" \nWe look around the house for antiques. There is a large desk that was handed down from an aunt to our family. \"It's very old,\" I tell Jenny. \"I try to keep it polished, and I show it off whenever I can. You do that with antiques.\" When Jenny gets older and understands such things, I might also tell her that whenever I look at the desk or touch it, I am reminded of the aunt who was dear to me and gave me the desk as a gift. I see her face again, though she is no longer with us. I remember myself as a little girl standing against this antique, listening to one of her stories.\n Our tour of antiques continues. There is a picture on the wall purchased at a yard sale. It is dated 1867, and it is not in very good condition. There is a vase on the floor. I'm not certain where it came from, but I didn't buy it new. And then there is an old-style bed, sent to me forty years ago from an uncle who slept in it for fifty years. \n\"The one thing about antiques,\" I explain to Jenny, \"is that they usually have a story.\" \nFor a moment Jenny looks thoughtful. \"I don't have any antiques but you,\" she says. Then her face brightens. \"Could I take you to school for our antiques show?\" \n\"Only if I fit into your backpack,\" I answer. And then her antique lifts her up and gives her a big hug that will last through the years.", "id": "high17947.txt"}
