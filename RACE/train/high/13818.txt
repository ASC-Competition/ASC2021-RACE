You're busy. And your shoes are away over there. Excuses are OK sometimes, but not every day--and especially not today. So put on your sneakers, get up off the couch, and let us kick your excuses to the curb  .\n\"I...dislike...panting !\"\nBeing really out of breath may mean you're trying too much too soon, which will kill your confidence. But you don't have to be _ to get a workout. Being active doesn't have to mean high-intensity. It's just about moving.\n\"I hate exercise.\"\nIt may seem unbearable, but you just have to get started. Exercise releases endorphins (your brain's own feel-good chemicals), which can be habit-forming. What' s the best exercise? The one you'll do regularly. So you may hate running. Don't run! Ride your bike or just dance. Even cleaning your room is active. As long as you're moving and getting your blood pumping, it counts. So get creative.\n\"I don't have time.\"\nYou may not have lots of time to spare when you're busy with schoolwork, but we bet you can find 10 minutes.

But you will feel them almost immediately. Don't focus on how your body looks--focus on how you feel. Keep a journal of when you exercise (or don't) and how you feel that day: Stressed? Focused? Tired? When you start noticing the amazing effects of exercise, you'll have no excuses.", "id": "high13818.txt"}
