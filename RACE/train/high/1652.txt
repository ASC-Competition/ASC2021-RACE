Or maybe former Monty Python star Michael Palin telling you no one had expected \"the Spanish bin-quisition\"?\nOrganizers of a plan persuading celebrities to lend their voices to \"talking bins\"believe it can make a real difference to keeping Britain tidy. They hope that by using humor, they will succeed where fines and warnings have failed in keeping streets and parks clean.\nA similar experiment in Sweden found a talking bin received nearly three times as much rubbish as an ordinary one because people were attracted by its quality of being new and unusual value.\nTwenty-five specially adapted bins to be installed in the streets of London and Liverpool next  month will use a sound card to play a themed message when litter is placed inside. For example,one near the Royal Opera House will play a \"thank-you\" message sung by Janis Kelly to the tune of Nessun Dorina. Bins installed in Liverpool will play Beatles-themed messages. For others,Britain's Got Talent  judge Holden is expected to record the message:\"This is Amanda, and this city's got talent.\"\nThe campaign,entitled Bin Thinking, is being organized by art group Sing London. If successful,talking bins could become a familiar feature on Britain's streets.\nColette Hiller, director of Sing London, said, \" The idea is to reward people in a small way for changing their behavior and raise awareness through a sense of fun.\"", "id": "high1652.txt"}
