Did you know that Thomas Edison failed 10,000 times while trying to invent the light bulb? He certainly had a \"learn and do\" attitude! He was able to turn each failed experiment into a successful way to invent the light bulb. So what can we learn from this? You can adopt the \"fail forward\" strategy too.\nIn reality, none of us are failures. It's true that we will experience times of defeat, problems, and disasters, but remember, each one of us is meant to succeed in life. However, we must choose our fate. Henry David Thoreau said, \"Men are born to succeed, not to fail.\"\nWe can never be forced into having a happy and successful life. Whether or not you experience success or failure is completely controlled by what you think and do. You are the only one who can choose the thoughts that will keep you from achieving the abundant life and joy that you are meant to have. No matter how difficult things may seem, say to yourself, \"I choose to be a happy and successful person.\"\nWhy do some people get what they want and others fail? I believe that getting what you desire in life takes planning, and it doesn't just happen by luck. So how do we plan for success?\nIt has been proven that successful people do things more differently than unsuccessful people. They recognize the patterns of success and follow them; one of those patterns is planning. They plan what they think and do, which sets them apart. They know exactly what they desire, have an intelligent plan for getting it, and then work their plan. They know what success will cost them in terms of time, energy, and results, and they devote the right resources toward making their plans happen.", "id": "high4859.txt"}
