When I got there, the Secret Service had already finished collecting knives and scissors, anything that could be used as a weapon. All of a sudden, he popped in and went, \"Where's Scott?\" and I went, \"Right here, sir.\" and he went, \"My God, you're the biggest pizza guy I've ever seen; if I eat your pizza, will I get as strong as you?\" and I said, \"You want to see how strong I am?\" And that was when I gave him a bear hug. He wasn't expecting that, and I wasn't expecting to do it. He thought it was funny.\n    I am a Republican. But I voted for the president four years ago because he seemed enthusiastic and excited about trying to make our country better. When he came to the store, he was exactly that same way. He was very genuine.\n    The next day, we started getting hate mails. People were calling in hundreds of dollars of fake  food orders. When we realized what was going on, we sent the food to homeless shelters. But when the story came out, people started calling us from all over the country, saying, \" Here's $ 100----deliver some pizzas to the firefighters...Deliver some pizzas to the United Way...\"We had thousands of dollars in orders.\n    The hug got old, but to a lot of people, it represented what we need: the country coming together and ending all divisions. Here was a white guy who is a Republican and an African American who is a Democrat and the president, and we are hugging! I got letters from people saying it lifted the spirits of the whole country, and that was pretty wild to hear---- there I was, a pizza guy, and I lifted the spirits of the country!", "id": "high18241.txt"}
