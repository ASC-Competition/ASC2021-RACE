The real community of Celebration, Florida, built in 1999, applies the social and environmental goals of both Disney and the New Urbanism movement.\nDisney and the New Urbanism have imagined communities that promote social and local communication. Celebration has a central Market Street district to reduce traffic and encourage social contacts. The idea is that if the downtown area is neatly and closely ranked, people will walk and meet their neighbors. Downtown events like arts festivals also bring citizens together. Narrow, tree-lined streets are \"traffic calm\"----with slower speed limits----to encourage bicycling and walking.\n   Moreover, housing in Celebration includes both single- and multi-family houses that encourages socialization. Apartment buildings are located close to downtown, and houses are built close together with small yards. They feature entrance halls to encourage citizens to socialize.\n   \"Many aspects of that kind of design are really aimed at maximizing social communication between citizens, not just on the streets but also in community institutions that are very much a part of public life there,\" says Andrew Ross, a New York University professor who lived in Celebration for one year.\n   Utopian communities such as Celebration are also designed with environmental protection in mind. The town itself is built on 4,900 acres surrounded by a 4,700 acre protected greenbelt. The greenbelt parks, and common areas accommodate native wildlife and animals.\n   High-rise office and apartment buildings provide close office and living space in a small geographic area in order to reduce urban  _ , the spread of today's cities onto nature areas.\nBuildings also minimize environmental influence by using cooling; and electric systems with insulated (;) glass, cooling towers, and energy-saving lamps.\n   \"The town more or less borrows very heavily from New Urbanist principles...to create environmentally friendly alternatives to sprawl and to create communities around people rather than vehicles,\" Ross said.", "id": "high22639.txt"}
