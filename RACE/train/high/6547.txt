Interestingly, in Chinese culture, thoughts are also related to the belly in phrases and idioms like fugao (, a draft), manfu jinglun (, a bellyful of ideas), and yiduzi weiqu (, a bellyful of complaints).\nThis may sound a little ridiculous at first. But try to think of a time when you were extremely nervous. Chances are that you also felt uncomfortable in your stomach, didn't you? This is probably why people use the idiom \"butterflies in one's stomach\" to refer to being nervous.\nNow scientists from Canada and the US have found that our guts  , if not as bright as our actual brains, are much more than just where we digest the food we eat. They also affect our emotions and even behavior, all thanks to the bacteria in them, reported Scientific American.\nIn the study, scientists fed timid mice stomach bacteria from mice that were more active and daring. After eating the bacteria, the timid mice grew more energetic and fearless. Sure enough, when _ mice got the bacteria from timid ones, they became more anxious. The mice's behavior also changed when scientists disturbed the bacteria in their guts by changing their diets and feeding them antibiotics  .\n\"If something goes wrong in the gut, that change is reflected in the brain,\" Emeran Mayer, a professor at University of California, Los Angeles, told The Huffington Post.\nThe brain-and-gut connection also works in the opposite way. Scientists studied children with autism   --- a mental illness that makes people unable to socialize with others --- and found that they also have a lot of stomach problems. They have fewer types of stomach bacteria and lower totals of a few key bacteria than healthy children.\nThis research raises the possibility that scientists could treat patients with brain problems simply by feeding them the right food, which would be much more efficient than providing psychological therapy  .\nAccording to CBC News, you can get \"good\" bacteria that lift your spirits from food like yogurt while \"bad\" bacteria are usually in high fat and high sugar foods.", "id": "high6547.txt"}
