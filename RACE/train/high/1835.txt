We think that Mr.Banish has story to tell.We plan to publish his story.\"\nWhen asked why he didn't return the books, Mr.Banish said,\"Well,how could I? They became family to me.I was afraid to return them,because I knew that kids or dogs would get hold of these books and chew them up,throw them around,tear the pages,spill soda on them,get jelly  on them,and drown them in the toilet.\nHe continued,\"Books are people,too! They talk to you,they take care of you,and they enrich you with wisdom,humor and love.A book is a guest in my home.How could I kick it out? I repaired tor n  pages.I dusted them with a soft clean cloth.I turned their pages so they could breathe and get some fresh air.\"\n\"Every week I reorganized them on their shelves so they could meet new friends,My books were HAPPY books.You could tell just by looking at them.Now they're all back in the libraries,on the lower shelves,on the floors,at the mercy of all those runny-nosed kids I can hear them calling me.I need to rescue them.Excuse me.I have to go now.\"", "id": "high1835.txt"}
