One document in particular from GCHQ listed what information can be found from which apps, mentioning Android apps but suggesting the same data was available from the iPhone platform.\nAngry Birds maker Rovio Entertainment of Finland said it had no knowledge of any NSA or GCHQ programs for tapping into its users' data.\n\"Rovio doesn't have any previous knowledge of this matter, and have not been aware of such activity in 3rd party advertising networks,\" said Saara Bergstrom. \"Nor do we have any involvement with the organizations you mentioned.\"\nMobile photos uploaded to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter appear to be a particularly rich source of information for the spy agencies as well. Metadata in the photos is briefly available. The NSA and GCHQ are able to tap into that metadata to collect a wealth of key data points about a person's life.\n\"NSA does not profile everyday Americans as it carries out its foreign intelligence mission,\" the agency told the Times in response to questions about the program.\nDuring a Monday press conference, White House press secretary Jay Carney stressed that same position. \"As the president said in his Jan. 17 speech, to the extent data is collected by the NSA, through whatever means, we are not interested in the communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets  and we are not after the information of ordinary Americans,\" he said.", "id": "high6110.txt"}
