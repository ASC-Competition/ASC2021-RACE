Before being sent away this boy was the brightest student in his class. He was at the top in every competition. He was a champion.\nBut the boy changed after leaving home and attending the boarding school. His grades started dropping. He hated being in a group. He was lonely all the time. And there were especially dark times when he felt like killing himself. All of this was because he felt worthless and that no one loved him.\nHis parents started worrying about the boy. But even they did not know what was wrong with him. So his dad decided to travel to the boarding school and talk with him.\nThey sat on the bank of the lake near the school. The father started asking him casual questions about his classes, teachers and sports. After some time his dad said, \"Do you know son, why I am here today?\"\nThe boy answered back, \"to check my grades?\"\n\"No, no\" his dad replied, \"I am here to tell you that you are the most important person for me. I want to see you happy. I don't care about grades. I care about you. I care about your happiness. YOU ARE MY LIFE.\"\nThese words caused the boy's eyes to fill with tears. He hugged his dad. They didn't say anything to each other for a long time.\nNow the boy had everything he wanted. He knew there was someone on this earth who cared for him deeply. He meant the world to someone. And today this young man is in college at the top of his class and no one has ever seen him sad!\nThanks a lot dad. YOU ARE MY LIFE.", "id": "high16660.txt"}
