Among the key revelations (=facts) are that callers feel happier at home and sadder at work.\nTo break it down, scientifically, it shows 45 percent of all emotions produced at home are \"happy\"and 54 percent of emotions at work are \"sad\".\nMeanwhile, people show more \"intense\"(=nervous) emotions in the evening than they do in the morning.\nOf course, this could just be because most people feel too tired in the morning to get overly \"intense\". Eating breakfast and getting to work on time is usually enough of an achievement.\nAnyway, the Emotion Sense technology has been developed by psychologists  and computer scientists who say it uses speech recognition software and phone sensors  attached to standard smart phones to judge how callers' emotions are changed by everyday factors.\nThe sensors analyze voice samples and these are then divided into five categories: happiness, sadness, fearfulness, anger or neutral---boredom or passivity  would fit into this last category.", "id": "high4845.txt"}
