And as for sea travel ,it hardly deserves mention ,It is perfectly summed up in the words of the old song:'I joined the navy to see the world ,and what did I see? I saw the sea'. You mention the place names in the world like EI Dorado, Kabul and someone is sure to say'I've been there'meaning ,'I drove through it at 100 miles an hour on the way to somewhere else.'\nWhen you travel at high speeds, the present means nothing :you live mainly in the future because you spend most of your time looking forward to arriving at some other place, But actual arrival ,when it is achieved , is meaningless , You want to move on again . By traveling like this, you suspend  all experience; the present stops being a reality:you might just as well be dead.\nThe traveler on foot, on the other hand , lives constantly in the present, For him traveling and arriving are one and the same thing: he arrives somewhere with every step he makes, He experiences, the present moment with his eyes, his ears and the whole of his body, At the end of his journey he feels a delicious physical tiredness, Satisfying sleep will be his: the just reward of all true travelers.", "id": "high4996.txt"}
