As to the Englishmen, I promised them to send them some women from England, with a good cargo  of necessaries, if they would apply themselves to planting ---- which I afterwards could not perform. And the fellows proved very honest and diligent after they were mastered and had their properties set apart for them. I sent them also from the Brazils five cows, three of them being big with calf, some sheep, and some pigs, which when I came again were considerably increased.\nBut all these things, with an account how 300 Caribbeans came and invaded  them, and ruined their plantations, and how they fought with that whole number twice, and were at first defeated, and one of them killed; but at last a storm destroying most of their enemies' boats, they destroyed almost all the rest, and renewed and recovered the possession of their plantation, and still lived upon the Island.\nAll these things, with some very surprising incidents in some new adventures of my own,  for ten years more, I may perhaps give a further account of the story.", "id": "high20121.txt"}
