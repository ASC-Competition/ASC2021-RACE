They say patience is a virtue   seldom found in women and never in men. This may or may not be true, but it's fair to say that there is nobody on the earth who couldn't benefit from more patience.\nPatience is necessary for success.\nIt is said that \"all good things come to those who wait\". Many of the great scientists have remarked that their scientific discoveries came only through patient perseverance  . Edison said, \"Genius was 99% perspiration and only 1% inspiration.\" Patience teaches us to value the effort and not just the success. It is a mistake to think that happiness can only be obtained through achievements.\nPatience brings peace of mind.\nWhen we desire certain outcomes  , we'll have no peace of mind.

Through being patient and accepting our situation, it's quite possible for our suffering to be transformed.\nSri Chinmoy said, \"If failure has the strength to turn your life into bitterness itself, then patience has the strength to turn your life into the sweetest joy.\"", "id": "high5122.txt"}
