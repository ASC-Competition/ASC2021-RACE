One step is to make sure that the house has a _ look. Living room shades could be pulled down only half-away. Bedrooms that usually have the shades pulled down at night should be left down. Another is to make sure that all outside looks are the dead-belt  type. Still another is to leave several low-watt  lights burning and make sure that one is in the kitchen. Lights that turn on and off automatically  are the best. Then, too, it is a good idea to leave a radio turned into a talking station. Any type of conversation makes a burglar  think twice before trying to enter. Finally, while away on vacation, make sure that nothing collected in the front or back of the house. Make certain that the newspaper is stopped and that a trusted neighbor has been asked to pick up the posts.", "id": "high14740.txt"}
