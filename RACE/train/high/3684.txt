They have also collected trash in the mountains of Nepal with school children.\nSo far they have communicated with 45,000 children from South America, Australia and Asia, giving presentations about the importance of recycling and using alternative energy like solar and wind power.\n\"We need to motivate children,\" said Sabine.\nWhen they began their adventure in 2003 they had no children of their own.
