Time for a game now. The oldest brother is the seeker so I have to hide extra good because he's smart and will find me quickly. But where? Behind the garage won't work. The barn is too easy. Wait, I know. The door leading under the porch is perfect. No one would look for me under there.\nIt smells unpleasant under this porch. Wish I had picked another place to hide. Smelly cats! Too late now, I can hear brother seeking everyone out. I'll just sit here quiet as a mouse. Hah hah hah! I can hear you out by the barn! You'll never find me over there!\nIt's been a while and he hasn't found me yet. What's that I hear? Now all my brothers are looking for me. They've all been caught, but not me. They'll never trick me into coming out to catch me. Wait, is that Dad I hear calling my name? Oh no, now I hear someone going to call Grandpa to help look for me. I'm not coming out now because I'm in really big trouble.\nWhat to do? If I come out and say I heard them calling me, I'll be in big trouble. Think, think! How do I get out of trouble? I know what to do! I'll tell them I fell asleep while waiting. Is that Grandpa's voice? Heh heh heh! Now's my chance. I'll crawl out slowly and rub my eyes. Now that I see Grandpa go towards me quickly, I say. \"I fell asleep.\"\n\"Oh! You had us all worried!\" says Grandpa. \"You little devil, I'm just glad you're all right, but next time try not to fall asleep and scare us like that, okay?\" says Dad. Whew! I pulled it off  . Now to keep my mouth shut. And I did, for over 42 years. Once in a while, a kid pulls the wool over people's eyes. So that's one of my little secrets I've never revealed before. Don't tell anyone now!", "id": "high19043.txt"}
