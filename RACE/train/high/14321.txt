This is now possible with the help of 3D printers. Such machines were once used just\nby universities and big companies, but now, stores with 3D printing services are appearing around the\nUnited States.\nBryan Jaycox and his wife opened The Build Shop LLC in Los Angeles two years ago. The store\nis filled with tools like a laser cutter, an industrial sewing machine and 3D printers. The Jaycoxs offer\n3D printing classes and services for anyone who is interested.\n\"I think 3D printing is going to be huge. It's going to have a huge effect on society as a whole.\"\nOne of the students in a recent class was KiChong Tran. He plans to open a 3D printing business in\nCambodia.\n3D printing services are becoming available for American consumers.\nThe UPS Store is a nationwide retailer ( ) that provides shipping, copying and other\nservices. The UPS Store recently put 3D printers in three of its independently-owned stores. Burke\nJones owns one of the stores in San Diego.\n\"The demand has been amazing. It's been much more than I would have imagined.\" The UPS\nStore plans to add 3D printers in three more stores.\nAt The UPS Store, the cost of the object depends on the amount of materials used. The store\ncharges up to $95 an hour to design the object with computer software that creates a digital file to\nguide the printer.\nMr. Jaycox predicts that within five years, 3D printing technology could become more popular.\nBut KiChong Tran says even current technology can make a difference in a developing country like\nCambodia.\n\"With 3D printing, you can give them tools; you put it in their hands so they are responsible\nmore for their own development and they learn skills beyond just learning English and becoming a\ntour guide or something like that or working at a bank; you can actually create things that give value\nto the world.\"\nHe says it's not just in Cambodia but anywhere where there is a 3D printer that it can turn a good\nidea into reality.", "id": "high14321.txt"}
