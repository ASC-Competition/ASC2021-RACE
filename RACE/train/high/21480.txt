It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses.\nHe went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. \"How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?\" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations .\n\"No, I have to have roses,\" he said, \"My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite.\"\nThe florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, \"Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars.\" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement.\nJohn ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery .\nThe light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, \"Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please. Tell my mommy I love her.\" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car. He drove quickly to the flower shop and told the florist he would take the flowers personally.", "id": "high21480.txt"}
