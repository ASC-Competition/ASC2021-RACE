The average age of the first marriage has increased to 28.7 for men and 26.7 for women, up from 27.5 and 25.9 respectively in 2006. At the same time, fewer people are getting married. If the marriage rate had stayed the same as in 2006, there would have been about 4 million more married people in 2010.\n*Fewer babies. There were 200,000 fewer births among women aged 20 to 34 in 2010 compared with two years before.

The proportion of people aged 16 to 64 in employment dropped greatly in all but one of the 50 largest metropolitan   areas. That has helped push the share of people driving to work alone from 76 percent in 2006 to 76.6 percent in 2010. Ride-sharing is down a full percentage point, to 9.7 percent.", "id": "high21804.txt"}
