Walking over to the young trouble-maker, I asked for the note in her hands.\nIt was a had-drawn picture of me, teeth blackened, nostrils  upwards, and the words \"I'm stupid\" coming out of my mouth. I managed to fold up the picture calmly and continue the class. My mind, however, was working angrily. I knew the two most likely suspects for drawing the picture. Maybe it was high time that I taught them a lesson!\nSomehow, in the very moment of real hurt and anger, I asked myself very softly, \"How can I ever bring good out of this?\"\nWhen there were about six minutes left of the class, I showed the kids the picture. The whole class was silent. I told them there must be a reason behind such a picture and that now was their chance to tell me the reason. Then I let them write silently while I stood sadly in the back of the classroom.\nMost of them either blamed the artist or felt sorry. But two notes, from the girls I figured were behind the picture, had a list of issues. I was too mean and too strict. Reading those notes, I realized that where I thought I was driving them to success I was actually driving them away. I had some apologizing to do.\nWhen the kids walked into my classroom the next day, one boy and one girl each handed me a card. The one signed by all the boys expressed sincere regret for the ugly joke. The one from the girls asked for forgiveness. I was extremely surprised. And more than a little shameful. I had my little speech all ready to give to the kids, but they did it before me.", "id": "high21999.txt"}
