He's never late to work. He does not get upset on the job. When one of his employees started crying after a customer screamed at her, Travis took her away. \"Your working uniform is your shelter,\" he told her. \"Nothing anyone says will ever hurt you. You will always be as strong as you want to be.\"\nTravis picked up that lecture in one of his G&G training courses, an education program that began on his first day and continues throughout an employee's occupation. The training has, Travis says, changed his life. G&G has taught him how to live, how to focus, how to get to work on time, and how to master his emotions  . Most importantly, it taught him willpower.\nAt the center of that education is an extreme focus on an all-important habit; willpower. Dozens of cases show that willpower is the single most important habit for a person's success.\nAnd the best way to strengthen willpower is to make it into a habit. \"Sometimes it looks like people with great self-control aren't working hard--but that's because they've made it automatic,\" Angela Duckworth, one of the University of Pennsylvania researchers said. \"Their willpower occurs without them having to think about it.\"\nThe company spent millions of dollars developing programs of study to train employees on self-control. Managers wrote workbooks that serve as guides to how to make willpower a habit in workers' lives. Those courses arc, in part, why G&G has grown from a sleepy company into a large one with more than seventeen thousand stores and profits of more than $10 billion a year.", "id": "high16350.txt"}
