The next day he is a gangster from Temple street. His songs are heard on radios all over Hong Kong. This is Andy Lau Tak Wah, the superstar that everyone sees, hears and loves. He is one of the most famous actors and singers in Hong Kong.\nHowever, there is another side to Andy Lau. There is an important part of his life that only a few people know about. Andy Lau helps 15 children from poor countries all over the world. These boys and girls live in 11 different countries. Most of the children have not met him and none of them know that he is one of the biggest stars in Asia.\nAndy Lau's interest in children started when he did some work with World Vision. This is a charity that helps poor children to lead better lives. For $200 a month, a  _ helps with the food and education of one child.\nThe child does not receive the money in cash. Instead the money pays for the child's school fees, food, medical care and clothing. Each child knows the name of the sponsor who is giving the money. The sponsor receives a report each year on the child's progress. They can write to each other, but usually the children do not speak Cantonese or English.\nWhen Andy Lau heard about these children, he wanted to help them. \"It was not anything special,\" he said. \"Until I had the chance to go to Indonesia and meet the little girl I am sponsoring, I didn't know anything about the type of life she had.\"\nHe said the meeting with Nina in Indonesia was very emotional. \"When I met her, I felt very, very happy,\" he said. \"I saw that the money was used for a very good purpose. It brought me closer to the child in a way that simply giving money cannot.\"\nBy sponsoring these children through a charitable organization, Andy Lau is giving them hope and at the same time caring for them. \"I want to do whatever I can. I will continue to help these children in need,\" he said.", "id": "high20809.txt"}
