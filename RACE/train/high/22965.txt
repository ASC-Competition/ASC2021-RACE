My parents spent a lot of money on a private school, so they could get me into a competitive middle school. Everything was about tomorrow, next year, my graduation. We never had to worry about today.\nBefore last summer I never thought much about the people in the world who live day to day, every day, whose lives are controlled by poverty and hunger. Then I enrolled in a two-week intensive program. We lived in a \"Tribal Village,\" in a hot, dry open grassland in Arkansas, a state of the south-central United States. I am a tribal member in Mozambique, a country of southeast Africa. Every meal, I make the fire for my family, and feel the flames lick up my nostrils as I blow to keep the fuel alive. I cook mush with vegetables. This is all my family is ever given.\nI feed the hen and three rabbits their dinner. I grow attached to the rabbits, even though I know I shouldn't. I name them. I'm not getting enough to eat; it's time to decide whether or not to kill the rabbits. I feel pain but it's a privileged child's pain because I know I will soon be eating again. That's not true for a lot of other children around the world.\nGrowing up comfortably in the U.S., I've never had to worry about my dinner, and even though this whole process was only a  _ , it changed my life. Now I believe in doing whatever I can to help find practical ways to defeat hunger.\nSo I've become president of Roots and Shoots, a group working to improve local environments for people and animals. I'm also working to create a program at my high school called the \"Safe Passage\" trip to help young people in the Guatemala City dump. And I've got plans to do more.\nI'm often thinking of laboring in the hot sun and the millions who still do. Now, I try to live for today and stop worrying so much about the future. When I eat or feel full, I am grateful for this fortunate life and want to extend the same feeling to others.\nI believe in offering help to those who need it.", "id": "high22965.txt"}
