It normally features a single person on stage, as opposed to a duet. Although music is sometimes included, other features such as dance are a lot rarer.\nInstead, stand-up comedy is usually just one person, a microphone and the audience. Whether the comedian  _ or has people in fits of laughter is all down to his or her skill.\nI never used to like the idea of stand-up comedy. It seemed too forced for me. \"I'll laugh when I feel like it,\" I thought. I don't want to have someone stand in front of me, pressuring me to chuckle.\nStand-ups also have a reputation for picking on their audience. If you sit close to the front of the stage, you'd better be careful. One cough or wrong move, and the comedian will pounce. Before long, you are the focus of all the jokes.\nBut a couple of years ago, I went to see a comedian who changed my opinion - British stand-up Stewart Lee. He is not hugely famous, but instead of jokes, he told very funny, often long stories about his life. His delivery was dry, and he had a very quick wit. I soon began to appreciate just how hard it is to make people laugh on demand.\nThe great thing about stand-ups is that you hardly ever see two that are the same. There are so many different approaches, and people from all sorts of backgrounds can make people laugh in different ways.\nFor example, one of the most popular stand-up comedians in the world is Chris Rock. Rock is African-American, and uses his race, and the problems he faces because of it, as material for his routines. He turns a topic that is normally serious into something funny.\n\"A black C student can't be a manager at Burger King, meanwhile a white C student just happens to be the President of the United States,\" he once joked about racism in the United States during George Bush's presidency.\nThat is the beauty of stand-up comedy. Just about anything can be turned into a joke.", "id": "high22752.txt"}
