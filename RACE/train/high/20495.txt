This price also includes an eightweek training course on an island. During their stay, guests would see the sunrise 15 times a day and travel around the world every 80 minutes. \n \nGalactic Suite Ltd's CEO Xavier Claramunt says the project will put his company in a leading position of a new industry with a huge future ahead of it, and forecasts space travel will become common in the future. \"It's very normal to think that your children, possibly within 15 years, could spend a weekend in space\" he told Reuters Television.\nA promising space tourism industry is beginning to take shape with construction in progress in New Mexico of Spaceport America, the world's first facility built specifically for passengers.  British industrialist Richard Branson's space tours firm, Virgin Galactic, will use the facility to send tourists to space at a cost of $200,000 a ride.\nGalactic Suite Ltd, set up in 2007, hopes to start its project with a single pod   in orbit 280 miles above the earth. \"It will take a day and a half to reach the pod, and the passengers will join it for three days,\" Claramunt said. More than 200 people have expressed an interest in traveling to the space hotel and at least 43 people have already reserved it.\nThe numbers are similar for Virgin Galactic with 300 people already paid or signed up for the trip, but unlike Branson, Galactic Suite says they will use Russian rockets to transport their guests into space from a spaceport to be built on an island in the Caribbean. But critics have questioned the project, saying the length of time that will be used is unreasonable and also where the money is coming from to support the project.", "id": "high20495.txt"}
