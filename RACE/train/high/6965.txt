In fact,it has been well-recorded over the years. Twelve hours before Hurricane Charlie hit Florida in 2004,fourteen sharks left their natural habitat and stayed in deep waters for two weeks. The sharks,which were being observed by US scientists,had never done this before.They escaped the hurricane.In the winter of 1975 in Haicheng,China,snakes which would normally have been hibernating were seen on the ground.Days later there was a big earthquake striking.\nUnlike human beings,wild animals' senses are sharper and they can feel even the smallest changes in the environment.In other words,they see natural warnings that are invisible to the human eye.Ancient people probably had the similar\"senses\", which they needed to survive,but these have been lost to us as modern technology leads us further away from the danger that nature creates.\nThe real question is,can we use the reactions of animals to save ourselves from natural disasters? Animal behaviour expert,Rupesh Kaneira,believes we have no choice.\"The technology which we rely on isn't always perfect,and in poorer countries it isn't even available .Animals know the environment better than any of us.When they run for their lives,we must follow.\"", "id": "high6965.txt"}
