However, the teacher that I remember most was Mrs. Green from Marianna, Florida. She was my 5thgrade teacher. Since I was a new student, not only in her class, but at the school, she made my time there much more pleasant. I immediately began to like her. She was really funny and I knew that she liked me. She made learning fun. I remember one day for Christmas holidays, she taught us how to make ornaments  from eggs. My parents still have some of the ornaments I made.\nShe made me leader for many group projects and that made me feel special. I think that would make any child feel special, especially when a child is in a new place with no friends. She made me want to be like that. Not to pick a \"favorite\" student, but to make every student feel that they are special. That year, I received the Presidential Academic Award  . I was really proud and so were my parents.\nLooking back at it, I think the reason why I did so well was that I felt important. Students do better when they feel like they are important or loved. Mrs. Green always gets to know her students and forms personal relationships with them, which I will try to do some day. I just hope that there will be a student who finds me to be their favorite teacher as I found her to be mine.", "id": "high8199.txt"}
