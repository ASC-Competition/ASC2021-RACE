One thing I noticed was that most of the work was done by robots. Welding  , painting, testing and many other jobs are performed by robots. The whole dashboard   is put into a car by a robot. It would have taken two men to do so in the past, and it would have hurt their backs quite a bit.\nIt got me thinking: Is it a good thing that robots are replacing factory workers? On the one hand, robots generally do a more accurate job than people. They are not likely to make many mistakes. If something goes wrong with one car, an alarm goes off. They do exactly the same thing every time, but a human worker is unable to do so. On the other hand, robots reduce costs for companies. Companies don't have to pay robots wages or injury compensation   if they're broken. If something in a robot does go wrong, it won't have to take time off work for a year, or even forever, as could happen to a real person if he breaks his back or burns himself while welding.\nThe obvious _ is that robots increase unemployment rate, which in turn increases taxes. We don't want to pay for those who are out of work just because a company has replaced them with robots.", "id": "high7088.txt"}
