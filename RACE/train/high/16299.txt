Jim Yong Kim told a Washington audience Tuesday, he wants to make ending world poverty by 2030 a top goal for the bank and governments around the world.\nWorld Bank President Jim Yong Kim says that the problems of poverty, hunger and inequality are wide, urgent and a matter of survival of millions.\n\"We know that despite the great successes of the last decade, there are still about 1.3 billion people living in extreme poverty, 870 million who go hungry every day, and 6.9 million children under five dying every year,\" he said.\nBut Kim told a Washington audience that the previous successful efforts to cut the number of people living in extreme poverty by half give them hope.\n\"We are at an\nmoment in history, when the successes of past decades and an increasingly favourable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance-for the first time ever-to end extreme poverty within a generation,\" he said in a speech at Georgetown University. \"Our duty now must be to ensure that these favourable circumstances are matched with deliberate decisions to realize this historic opportunity.\"\nKim says success will require increasing the speed of economic growth, particularly in South Africa and South Asia.\nBut he warned that civil unrest could happen if economic growth does not help people at all income levels, and also include women and youth.\nKim says that the World Bank and other development agencies will have more resources to get this job done right. \"Meeting this 2030 goal will take extraordinary effort,\" he said.\nHowever, Kim warned that all the progress in fighting poverty could be destroyed by climate disasters unless the nations of the world do more to prevent climate change.", "id": "high16299.txt"}
