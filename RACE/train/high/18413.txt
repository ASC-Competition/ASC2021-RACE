They can be minor problems or life-threatening emergencies. Distinguishing a minor burn from a more serious burn involves determining the degree of damage to the tissues of the body. If you are not sure how serious the burn is, seek emergency medical help.\nFirst-degree burns are those in which only the outer layer of skin is burned. The skin is usually red and some swelling   and pain may occur. Unless the burn involves large portions of the body, it can be treated at home.\nSecond-degree burns are those in which the first layer of skin has been burned through and the second layer of skin is also burned. In these burns, the skin reddens intensely and blisters   develop. Severe pain and swelling also occur. Second-degree burns require medical treatment.\nThird-degree burns are the most serious and involve all layers of skin. Fat, nerves, muscles, and even bones may be affected. Areas may be charred black or appear a dry white. If nerve damage is substantial, there may be no pain at all. These burns require emergency medical attention.\nFollow these steps when treating minor burns at home \n1) If the skin is not broken, run cool water over the burn for several minutes.\n2) Cover the burn with a sterile   bandage or clean cloth.\n3) Take aspirin to relieve any swelling or pain. \nSeek emergency treatment immediately for major burns. Before an emergency unit arrives, follow these steps\n1) Remove the person from the source of the burn (fire, electrical current, etc.). \n2) If the person is not breathing, begin mouth-to-mouth resuscitation   immediately. \n3) Remove all clothing to stop further burning. If the clothing is stuck to the burn, do not attempt to remove it. \n4) Cover the burned area with a cool, moist, sterile bandage or clean cloth.
