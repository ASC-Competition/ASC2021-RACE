Here're some practical tips to help you get fit. \nMaster your mind--most people argue that they're too tired or old to start exercising. Doing so is much easier than trying to change the busy lifestyle. Change your mindset and be more confident in improving your health. Tell your body to be more active and say, \"I can do it.\"\nEasy does it--once you have chosen a fitness program, start slowly and increase it in stages. Begin with just a few minutes of gentle exercises and stretches. Go next to some mild activity such as walking, jogging or cycling. About 30 minutes should be devoted to your workout. As your body starts to respond and your muscles get used to the exercises, you can gradually increase the length of your workout. \nDon't overload your body--there's no quick access to getting fit.

If you don't know how to balance your needs and your expectations, you might seriously injure your muscles or just create stress.\n _ -- always remember to warm up your muscles before exercising.
