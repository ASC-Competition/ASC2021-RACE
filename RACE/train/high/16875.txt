He is one of the only three chefs in the country to maintain three Michelin stars for their restaurant.\nGordon was born in Scotlandbut was brought up inEnglandafter his family moved toStratford. He played football as a teenager for Oxford United Football Club's youth side and was spotted by a scout for Rangers. He became a professional player at the age of 15. After a knee injury that left him unable to regain full fitness, he was released from the club.\nAt the age of 19 Ramsay now turned his hand to cookery. He worked under Marco Pierre White and Albert Roux in London and Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon in Parisbefore becoming head chef of the newly-opened Aubergine restaurant in 1993. By 1996, the restaurant had been awarded two Michelin stars. In 1998 Ramsay opened his first own restaurant inChelsea. The restaurant gained three Michelin stars in 1999, making Ramsay the first Scot to gain the achievement. From there his empire has expanded rapidly, opening a lot of restaurants.\nRamsay has published six books on cooking and also appeared in two documentaries --Boiling Pointin 1998 andBeyond Boiling Pointin 2000. The series showed that Ramsay is a hot-tempered man in the kitchen; he was seen yelling dirty words at his staff and throwing equipment around.
