A few days earlier I'd seen an ad. I was willing to try anything, so I contacted the owner, a woman named Camille. When she e-mailed me back I discovered she wasn't renting a house at all. She was renting the attic   apartment. I left her a message calling off our meeting.\nBut Camille called me back and insisted I come over. So here I was. I pulled the car to a stop and looked up at the tiny cottage. The house was small as it was. The attic window looked too tiny to let much light in. We couldn't live in a dark, depressing place. I could make do with almost anything. But Dash needs a good home, a place he really feels safe.\nNo sense in wasting her time or mine. I knocked. The woman who opened the door was small and bright-eyed. She was much older than I'd guessed, but I could see she had the energy of someone half her age. She looked so sympathetic that I found myself wanting to keep talking to her.\"We have to leave our home,\"I explained.\"My marriage ended. I only have a few days to find something else, but I want it to be right.\"\nCamille nodded.\"You're a good mother. You never know the miracles that await youaround the corner.\"Camille walked me to the door and wished me well. I got back in the car and snapped out of it. I drove off slowly, hoping to make the feeling last. I turned down a side street I didn't recognize. I glanced out of the side window. Just up ahead was a cottage with a sign out in front: for rent.\nI pulled over. I found the owners had just bought the house themselves and were decorating it, hoping to find the perfect renters. They took me on a tour of the house that was like a copy of my list: a big bedroom for Dash, a backyard with trees, and a great school nearby. The house was meant for us!\nCamille was right. Miracles await us, just around the corner.", "id": "high19595.txt"}
