Give yourself time to get familiar with the newsreaders and their accents. You should also get an idea of the structure of the entire report as well as the structure of a typical news story.\n* Watch the news in Chinese first. This will tell you what the main news items are and help prepare you for understanding news reports in English.\nWhile listening, you should pay attention to a few things that you may try to do:\n* You can aim at just getting what a story is about. Give a one-to -tow-sentence description after each story.\n* Put forward a few questions to yourself about a story, and then seek to answer them from your listening. You can do this by stopping the tape as soon as the headline is read to you. \n* Your may write a full transcript  of a story to practice intensive listening.
