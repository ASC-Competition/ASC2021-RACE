In fact, over the last 30 years, he's broken almost 400 Guinness World Records. And he recently broke the Guinness World Record for \"the most records held at the same time by an individual\". \n   Ashrita broke his first record in 1979, doing 27,000 star jumps in one go. But since then, he's set all sorts of records: clapping non-stop for 50 hours, balance a lawn mower   on his chin for almost two minutes... the list is endless. The 57-year-old New Yorker runs a health food shop but spends his free time training to break new records.\n   How does he decide which records to attempt? Simple! Ashrita studies the Guinness Book of Records online database. \"I used to stay up two or three hours in the morning,  _ the 40,000 records and chose the ones I was interested in.\" he explained. But these days, to make sure he has overall fitness, he chooses records that work different parts of his body.\n   In his attempts to break records, Ashrita often travels abroad. In 2005, he set the record for the \"fastest mile on a space hopper\" while jumping along the Great Wall of China. In 2003, he set the record for the \"longest time balancing on a Swiss ball\" at Stonehenge, England. And he likes to make his record attempts as challenging as possible.\n   As a teenager, he met a guru   and began studying meditation  . \"It changed my life... And I soon realized that limits are all in the mind.\" One day, his guru told him to go and \"break records\". So he did and he hasn't stopped since. He recently said, \"The point is joy. The point is the challenge. It's something silly, but you are the best in the world at it.\"", "id": "high23234.txt"}
