You can get there by sea. It is an interesting place and it had a long history. Macao is part of China and most people living there are Chinese.\nThe first Europeans to go to Macao came from Portugal . More than four hundred years ago the Portuguese went there to trade with China. Some settled and made their homes there. They built strong forts(,) to guard the city and the harbor. They also built churches, schools, hospitals and other places. Slowly the city grew. People from many countries came to live and work in Macao.\nToday many people visit Macao. Some only go there to watch dog-racing or motor-racing or to gamble  with their money. But Macao is a quiet and peaceful place. It is pleasant just to walk around and look at old buildings and forts. You feel you are back in the old days. Of course, some of the buildings are now in ruins. The Church of St. Paul has only the front wall with many steps leading up to it. But it is still interesting to see.\nWhen you are hot and tired, there are small cool gardens to rest in. when you are hungry, there are good restaurants with many kinds of food. Nearby there are some islands, which are also nice and are easy to get to. There is certainly a lot to do in Macao.", "id": "high715.txt"}
