The 18-year-olds from Gloucester, U.K. are two of the five children born to their Caucasian   father and \"half-Jamaican\" mother. While their other siblings (brothers and sisters) have a blend   of features from their parents who have different skin colours, Lucy and Maria are unique: Lucy has fair skin and red hair, while Maria has brown skin and dark hair.\n\"No one ever believes we are twins because I am white and Maria is black,\" Lucy said. \"Even when we dress alike, we still don't look like sisters, let alone twins. When we meet friends for the first time they all refuse to believe we are twins and some have even made us produce our birth certificates to prove that we are really twins.\"\nUnlike identical   twins, fraternal twins are bom from two separate eggs. The BBC reports that for a biracial   couple expecting twins, there is about a 1 in 500 chance those twins will have different skin colors.\nThe Aylmers are proud of their uniqueness.\n\"Now we have grown older, even though we still look so different, the bond between us is much stronger,\" Lucy said. \"Now we are proud of the fact that we are each other's twin sister. Maria loves telling people at college that she has a white twin sister -- and I'm very proud of having a black twin sister, too.\"", "id": "high9946.txt"}
