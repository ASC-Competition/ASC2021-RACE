He explained that he wished\nto buy a pearl  for his wife's birthday and that the price didn't matter since business\nhad been very good for him that year. After examining a number of beautiful and valuable\npearls, he chose a nice black one that cost $5,000. He paid for the pearl, shook hands with\nthe jeweller and left.\n     A few days later the man returned and said his wife had liked the pearl so much that\nshe wanted another one just like it. It had to be exactly the same size and quality as she\nwanted a pair of earrings   made. \"Can you give me any advice on how to get such a \npearl?\" said the man. The jeweller replied, \"I would say it's nearly impossible to find an \nexact one like that pearl.\"\n     The rich man asked the jeweller to advertise  in the newspapers, and \noffered $25,000 for the matching pearl. Many people answered the ad , but nobody\nhad a pearl that was just right. Just when the jeweller had given up hope, a little old lady  \ncame in. To his surprise, she pulled the wonderful pearl from her handbag. \"I don't like to \nsell it,\" she said sadly. \"I inherited  it from my mother, and my mother inherited \nfrom hers. But now I really need the money.\"\n     The jeweller was quick to pay her before she changed her mind. Then he called the\nrich man's hotel to tell him the good news. The rich man, however, was nowhere to be\nfound.", "id": "high21012.txt"}
