Though he is only l8 years old and blind, Suleyman Gokyigit is among the top computer technicians and programmers at InteliData Technologies Corp., a large software company with several offices across the United States.\n\"After our company united with another one last October, two different computer networks were driving us crazy,\" recalls Douglas Braun, the InteliData president. \"We couldn't even send e-mail to each other.\" In three weeks Mr Gokyigit created the software needed to connect the two networks. \"None of the company's 350 other employees could have done the job in three months,\" says Mr. Braun. \" Suleyman can 'see' into the heart of the computer.\"\nMr. Gokyigfi's gift, as Mr. Braun calls it, is an unusual ability to form an idea of the inside of a machine. \"The computer permits me to reach out into the world and do almost anything I want to do,\" says Mr. Gokyigit\nThe young programmer is _ as well, thanks partly to a highly developed sense of touch. Mitzi Nowakowski, an office manager at InteliData, remembers how he easily disconnected and reconnected their computer systems during a move last year. \"Through feel, Suleyman can find the position of connectors, pins and wires much faster than most other people with sight,\" he says.\nMuch of the student programmer's speed comes from his ability not to be interrupted while at the computer. When typing, he listens carefully to the synthesizer  . His long, thin fingers fly over the keyboard. \"Nothing seems to shake his attention,\" says Mrs. Nowakowski, his boss.\nMr. Gokyigit is the only company employee who is available 24 hours a day. \"We consider him our top problem solver.\" says Mr. Braun.", "id": "high308.txt"}
