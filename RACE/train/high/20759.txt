I was complaining about something unfair that had happened to me. Dad looked directly at me and said, \"No one ever said life was fair.\" I was shocked at his answer. Later on as my marriage had problems even though I tried to save it.  _ . Now as I raise two kids alone, try to create new relationships and build a business, I am forced to face the inevitable  truth every day. Gradually I've found that I have accepted my dad's wisdom.\nWe all will face loss or unexpected changes. But unfairness should not be the only thing in our life. We choose for ourselves what seems fair by comparing our lives with others', and this can lead us to feel that our own lives are unfair. People need to ignore what others have and set their own plans. Certainly, there're so many unhappy events in the world and in our lives, and when we deal with them, we try to control as many things as we can. Then, the sense of \" it's not fair\" often comes when we can't control the things in our lives. So please put your efforts into the process rather than the result. You should learn that life is unfair, but you can be fair and learn how to enjoy life.", "id": "high20759.txt"}
