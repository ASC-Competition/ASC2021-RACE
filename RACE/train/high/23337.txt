Experts believe that willpower  is like a muscle, and needs to be exercised to help one avoid the temptation  spending a night on the couch instead.\nKathleen Martin-Ginis, a professor of kinesiology-the science of movement--who led the study, says everyone has a limited amount of willpower, and that it will be reduced by stress. Miss Martin-Ginis, of Canada's McMaster University, explains,\" Cognitive  tasks, as well as tasks such as regulating one's emotions, can reduce one's capacity to force oneself to exercise. \"\nHer team of scientists performed a so-called \"Stroop\" test on volunteers to reach their conclusions. The experiment involved showing participants words associated with color1s but printed in different color1s-for example, the word \"blue\" written in red ink Participants were divided into two groups. One group was asked to name the color1 of the ink, instead to say the printed word, while the other wasn't Martin-Girus says, \"After we used this cognitive task to use up their self-regulatory capacity, the participants didn't exercise as hard as those who had not performed the task \" The more people concentrated on the cognitive task, the more likely they were to skip exercise sessions  over the next eight week You only have so much willpower.\nHowever, there are ways to strengthen willpower. The study found the listening to music before going to the gym can help, as well as making a commitment to work out with friends. It also concluded that willpower can be stretched by constant cake, or forcing oneself to study an extra hour each night\nMartin- Ginis adds,\" There are strategies people can use to help revitalize  themselves after they've used up their self-regulation Willpower is like a muscle: it needs to be used to stay strong. \"", "id": "high23337.txt"}
