In the video, the band members ride a New York City subway while performing entirely on iPhones, with applications linked with mini-battery powered broadcasters for each instrument.\nSinger Luck White says the production was a top-secret operation.\n\"We didn't tell anyone about this. It was completely top-secret from our family, from our friends, from management, from everybody. So the first time that people saw this video was last Friday when we put it on YouTube,\"explained White.\nIt has been watched by more than 2 million on YouTube since debuting  last week. \"All I've wanted to do for the past few days is just stare at the YouTube page and keep refreshing it to see how far it will go, \" said Espiritu, the lead guitarist of the band.\n\"The Internet changed everything,\"Espiritu said. \"It's kind of an exciting time because it forces everyone to adjust and be creative and find new ways to get your name out there.\"\nThe idea for the video came from Espiritu's 24-year-old brother Benjamin, who's hoping to go to film school. \" I've seen a lot of these music applications, and they're kind of fascinating to me,\"Benjamin Espiritu said. \" I thought: 'What would happen if iPhones kind of took over the world? If there could actually be a band that played straight through with iPhones, what would that look like?'\" So they shot  the video --with iPhones also serving as video cameras. The band also tried Union Square but were stopped during playing because they didn't have a permit.\n\" _ ,\"Espiritu said. \"We've seen the jump.\" Their album has been in the top 10albums on iTunes.\nWill their fans start cheering for iPhone-only performances? \"We've gotten the most exposure and teh most fans that we've ever gotten through this, so I wouldn't be surprised if fans are going to want to see that.: Espritu said.", "id": "high8690.txt"}
