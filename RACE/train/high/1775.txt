Then he ordered his servants to tell everybody in his capital that if anyone brought him a fish, he would give him anything that he asked for.\nAt last, a fisherman caught a big fish late in the afternoon and hurried to the king's palace with it. But the king's Prime Minister would not let him in until he promised to give him half of whatever the king gave him for the fish.\nThe king was very happy when he saw the fish. He asked the fisherman what he wanted for his fish. To his surprise, the fisherman said, \"I want you to beat me two dozen  times with a stick.\" When the king began to beat him a dozen times, the fisherman jumped away and said, \"That is enough for me. I promised the other dozen to your Prime Minister.\" Then he told the king what had happened between the Prime Minister and himself. The king was very angry. He not only gave the Prime Minister the dozen hits, but also said, \"Because you have been dishonest, you will not be my Prime Minister any more. The fisherman will take your place.\"", "id": "high1775.txt"}
