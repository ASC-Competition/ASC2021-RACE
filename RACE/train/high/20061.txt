But Guido Daniele creates fantastic paintings of birds, elephants, tigers, and giraffes by painting on skin. Born in Soverato, Italy, Guido Daniele has been called\"Ha nd Gogh\" (after artist Vincent van Gogh) since he began creating works of art on people' s hands in 1990.\nPainting on the hands can be a challenge because, unlike canvas, the skin moves when rubbed. Daniele' s models must remain perfectly still for hours as he paints. He often uses his daughter and his son as his \"canvases\".\nBefore he can begin to create his \"manimals\" ( the artist' s name for his hand animals), Daniele studies photographs of the animal that he will be painting in order to be able to understand its character and give it life. \"Next,\" he says, \"I look at the hand from different perspectives   ,and I begin to imagine what is the best way to position the hand for me to paint the animal. \"He also studies the skin of the model, preferring it to have little hair and few blemishes  .\nDaniele starts by drawing on the model' s hand with a pencil. He next paints the skin using watercolor1s made specifically for body art. The eyes of Daniele' s painted animals look amazingly real, and they are the most difficult part to paint.\nPaintings on hands must eventually be washed away. Guido Daniele says that he's gotten used to this part and that he doesn' t really mind seeing his work washed down the drain  . \" Tomorrow, I will paint the next one. The important thing is to take many good photo- graphs before washing the hand!\"", "id": "high20061.txt"}
