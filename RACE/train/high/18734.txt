He loves to teach what he knows,from teaching my mother,aunt,and sisters driving skills to teaching his kids vocabulary. Also,whenever he is asked to do something at work,whatever it is,he will always complete the task on time.\nMy mother buys most of his clothes,as he hates big crowds. In his house,children watch TV only after finishing all homework,which he believes is the best,because the child does his homework and still stays happy.\nOne of my father's main focuses in life is making sure his children grow up the right way,like he did.He grew up with one sister in Chicago. As he got older,he got married to my mother who is three years younger than him.\nMy dad is an individual with numerous qualities. His personality is just very wonderful to live with. The manners he shows are so refined and probably much better than most people. I admire my father and want to be just like him when I grow up.", "id": "high18734.txt"}
