She was a good witch and dreamt to become a fairy godmother who can save people from trouble with magic powers. Wanda had been learning fairy godmother magic for 103 years. That morning, she decided to try the magic she had learned and bring happiness to others.\nSeeing Wanda, Charley cried, \"Hi, Wanda.\"\n\"Hi, Charley,\" replied Wanda, \"I have a surprise for you.\"\nThen, Wanda waved her wand , said a magic word, and Charley turned into a prince!\nWhen Charley-turned-prince looked at himself in the water, he cried, \"Hey!

And why would I do something as silly as snapping my fingers?\"\n\"Snapping fingers!\" cried out Wanda. \"That's what I forgot!\" She snapped her fingers, cried \"Upsi-doodle!\" and the castle and musicians disappeared and the prince became a little green frog.\"\nCharley looked at himself in the water. \" _ , Wanda. Oh, happy day! I'm a frog.\"\n\"I must apologize, Charley,\" Wanda said, \"you are a happy frog. I should know this a moment ago.\"", "id": "high1716.txt"}
