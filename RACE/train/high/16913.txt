That day, in the first class Sir Mushtaq said, \"Tomorrow there will be a parent teacher meeting and you will get your result.\" Hearing this Rehan was worried.\n     He went home as usual, but didn't tell his mother about the parent teacher meeting. The next day when his teacher asked him about his parents, he said, \"My parents are out of town, so please give my result to me.\"\n     When Rehan went back home, he told his mother that he had got 95. his mother was glad and said, \"Well done, my son! Show me your report card.\"\n     Now, Rehan was really worried but he said, \"Mom, actually this time we haven't got any report card and our teacher only told the result orally.\" A result without a report card? Rehan's mother asked, but didn't ask any more questions. She also promised to buy a new bicycle for Rehan as his reward.\n      One day Rehan came back from school, threw the bag on the floor and rushed towards his room. When his mother saw the dirty bag on the floor, she decided to clean it for him. As she opened it, she found the report card about which Rehan had lied.\n      Rehan's mother quickly went to Rehan's room and showed him the report card. Tears started to fall down from Rehan's eyes. For many days Rehan's mother didn't talk to him. At last Rehan said sorry to his mother for cheating. He promised to get first position in his class next time. \n     Rehan proved himself. He worked very hard and at last he got first position in the final term.", "id": "high16913.txt"}
