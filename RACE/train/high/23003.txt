Poor parental supervision also raises the chances of teenage drinking, said the Joesph Rowntree Foundation. If parents don't know where their children are on a Saturday night, or let them watch films of violence, they are more likely to have had an alcoholic drink.\n    The survey also found the behavior of friends is also a powerful factor in drinking habits. The more time teenagers spend with friends, the more likely they are to drink alcohol.\nIn this survey of 5,700 children aged 13 to 16, carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, researchers found that one in five wanted to have a drink by the time they were 14. By the age of 16, half of those questioned said they had been drunk.\n    Pamela Bremner, scientist of the survey, said, \"For the first time in the UK, this study shows what most influences young people's drinking behavior.\"\n    \"It found that the behavior of friends and family is the most common influential factor in determining how likely and how often a young person will drink alcohol.\"\n    Don Shenker, Chief Executive of Alcohol Concern, said, \"Government ministers must also look at some of the causes of why it is so easy for children to get alcohol, usually from the home.\"\n    \"Governments should look to see if they've done everything they can to help the large supermarkets from continuing to sell cheap alcohol which encourages more alcohol sales and therefore results in more alcohol being stored in the home.\"\n    The Royal College of Physicians also said it was not surprising that being able to get alcohol easily was an important factor on current drinking problems and drunkenness of teenagers.\n    A statement said, \"This shows that the government needs to focus more attention on increasing the price of alcohol, and increasing education and national campaigns for both young people and their families on the dangers of alcohol.\"", "id": "high23003.txt"}
