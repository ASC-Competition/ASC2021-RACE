Men were more likely to mention cultural, societal and family pressures than women. \nRobin Hadley, of Keele University, found that 59 percent of men and 63 percent of women said they wanted children. Of the men who wanted children, half had experienced loneliness because they did not have any children, compared with 27 percent of women. Thirty-eight percent of men had experienced depression because they did not have any children, compared with only 27 percent of women.\nOne in four men had experienced anger because they did not have any children, compared with 18 percent of women, while 56 percent of men had experienced sadness because they did not have any children, compared with 43 percent of women. However, no men had experienced guilt   because they did not have any children although 16 percent of women had. \nMr Hadley said, \"My work shows that there was a similar level of wish for parenthood among childless men and women in the survey, and that men had higher levels of anger, depression, sadness, jealousy  and loneliness than women. This challenges the common idea that women are much more likely to want to have children than men, and that they always experience all kinds of bad emotions more deeply than men if they don't have children.\"\nHe carried out his survey of 27 men and 81 women who were not parents using an online questionnaire among people aged 20 to 66, with an average age of 41.", "id": "high17058.txt"}
