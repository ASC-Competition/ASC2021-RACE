Unique among architecture schools, this program is compulsory for all members of the class, and students frequently refer to it as their reason for applying to Yale.\nThis year's class of 64 worked to design, develop and document an idea for a 2,100-square-foot, wheelchair-accessible, two-family house. Students had to use sustainable resources and energy-efficient technology. The budget for the project is always less than actual construction costs, and the builders-in-training had to seek supplementary donations, mostly in the form of construction materials.\nThe result this year was a \"designer\" home, dressed entirely in cedar , fitted inside with Swedish-designed cabinetry  and partially powered by solar energy. The floors are bamboo, another natural material prized for being quickly replenished . This year, the student-builders used a pre-cast foundation system, which, in addition to its other labor-saving virtues, uses 75% less concrete than the poured system. The first-year class of 2008 raised $100,000-worth of donated materials. But when it came to constructing the inside steps of the house, they used old drafting tables from the School of Architecture that would otherwise have been thrown out. \nGround was broken in May for the house at King Place, and the whole class worked on site until the construction was finished.", "id": "high22863.txt"}
