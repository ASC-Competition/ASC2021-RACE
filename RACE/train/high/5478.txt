Vitamin D is found in milk, as well as in some fortified orange juice, yogurt and cheeses, usually at around 100 international units (IU) a serving. People might want to consider a vitamin supplement to raise their intake to 1000 IUs per day, Garland said, adding that it was well within the safety guidelines established by the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe authors said that taking more vitamin D could be especially important for people living in northern areas, which receive less vitamin D from sunshine.\nAfrican Americans, who don't produce as much of the vitamin because of their skin colour, could also benefit significantly from a higher intake, the authors said.", "id": "high5478.txt"}
