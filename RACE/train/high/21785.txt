To win , they had to finish the 142-mile race in less than 10 hours . Teams and watchers knew there might be no winner at all , because these vehicles were missinge a key part drivers .\nDARPA , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , organized the race as part of a push to develop robotic vehicles for future battlefields . But the Grand Challenge , as it was called , just proved how difficult it is to get a car to speed across an unfamiliar desert without human guidance . One had its brake lock up in the starting area . Another began by throwing itself onto a wall . Another got tied up by bushes near the road after 1.9 miles .\nOne turned upside down . One took off in entirely the wrong direction and had to be disabled by remote  control . One went a little more than a mile and rushed into a fence ; another managed to go for six miles but stuck on a rock . The \"winner,\" if there was any , reached 7.8 miles before it ran into a long , narrow hole , and the front wheels caught on fire .\n\"You get a lot of respect for natural abilities of the living things,\" says Reinhold Behringer , who helped design two of the car-size vehicles for a company called Sci-Autonics . \"Even ants   can do all these tasks effortlessly . It's very hard for us to put these abilities into our machines .\"\nThe robotic vehicles , though with necessary modern equipment such as advanced computers and GPS guidance , had trouble figuring out fast enough the blocks ahead that a two-year-old human recognizes immediately , Sure , that very young child, who has just only learned to walk , may not think to wipe apple juice off her face , but she already knows that when there's a cookie in the kitchen she has to climb up the table , and that when she gets to the cookie it will taste good . She is more advanced , even months old , than any machine humans have designed .", "id": "high21785.txt"}
