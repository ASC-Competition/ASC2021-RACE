More importantly though, he appeared safely seven hours later, completing with exciting-photos and videos from this dark mysterious world that has been visited by only two humans before!\nSeated inside a specially built 12-ton green submersible   called the Deep Sea Challenger,  the brilliant filmmaker caught every moment of his 2-hour-36-minute journey down to the bottom of the Mariana Trench on video -- given that it is 120 times larger than the Grand Canyon and a mile deeper than Mount Everest.       \nAbsolutely nothing! There were no large alien creatures or mysterious footprints -- just a flat desolate   landscape, 50 times larger than the Grand Canyon.  Mr. Cameron describes it as \"devoid   of sunlight, any heat, any warmth\". The only things swimming around, were some tiny shrimp-like   creatures no bigger than an inch.\n     While the 57-year-old had expected to spend six hours at the bottom, he was forced to return in three hours, because the robotic arm that was supposed to help him collect samples went wrong and began leaking oil. He also lost some thrusters    and a whole starboard side,  causing the submersible to spin around in circles.                     \nHowever, these small setbacks did not make the whole trip any less exciting for Mr. Cameron. The director, who returned to the surface in a speedy seventy minutes, believes this is just one of many trips he and other adventurers will be taking. In fact, Sir Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, is currently in the midst of planning a similar trip to the Puerto Rico Trench that lies five miles below the surface of the water.  Though Mr. Cameron's is promising to move his historic trip into an exciting 3-D National Geographic documentary, he is tight-lipped about how the experience will be used in his next movie!  We cannot wait to see!", "id": "high18048.txt"}
