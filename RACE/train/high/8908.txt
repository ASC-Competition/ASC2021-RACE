Without the danger of being fired, there just hasn't been a lot of motivation  to get out of bed.\nI've quickly learned that getting up is the key to success and better yet: waking up early is really just a habit.\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is that you must have strong reasons to get out of bed. Motivation is the only thing keeping us from lying in bed all day.\nWriting down all the big and important things you'll do the next day can give you an extra push in your goal to wake up early and quickly.\nDon't read in bed. Spending as little time as possible in bed will actually help your body realize that the bed is for sleeping, and not for lying awake for hours. The goal of reading in bed is just to help you fall asleep within 10 minutes.\nStress is one of the main causes of poor sleep. Relax yourself before getting into bed. Try controlled breathing exercises or yoga to lower your stress level.\nThese are just a few ways you can use to wake up earlier. Finding the best way is the most important, and it requires a little work. The key thing is that waking up should be a pleasant experience. If you can make waking up something you are looking forward to, you're already halfway on your journey toward becoming an early riser.", "id": "high8908.txt"}
