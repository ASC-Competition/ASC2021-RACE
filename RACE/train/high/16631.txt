Many people feel this way after lunch.They may think eating lunch is the cause of the sleepiness.Or,in summer, they may think it is the heat.However, the real reason lies inside their bodies.At that time--about eight hours after you wake up--your body temperature goes down.This is what makes you slow down and feel sleepy.Scientists have tested sleep habits in experiments where there was no night or day.The people in these experiments almost always followed a similar sleeping pattern. They slept for one long period and then for one short period about eight hours later.\nIn many parts of the world,people take naps in the middle of the day.This is especially true in warmer climate ,where the heat makes work difficult in the early afternoon.Researchers are now saying that naps are good for everyone in any climate.A daily nap gives one a more rested body and mind and therefore is good for health in general.In countries where naps are traditional,people often suffer less from problem such as heart disease.\nMany working people,unfortunately, have no time to take naps.Though doctors may advise taking naps,employers do not allow it!
