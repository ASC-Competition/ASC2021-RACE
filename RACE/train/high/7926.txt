Written on the front were the words, \"To my grandson.\" Recognizing his grandfather's handwriting, the young man opened the envelope. A letter inside read:\nDear Ronny,\nYears ago you came to me for help. You said, \"Grandpa, how is it that you've accomplished so much in your life? You're still full of energy, and I'm already tired of struggling. How can I get that same enthusiasm that you've got?\"\nI didn't know what to say to you then. _ , I figure that I owe you an answer. So here is what I believe.\nI think a lot of it has to do with how a person looks at things. I call it \"keeping your eyes wide open\".\nWhen you meet up with challenges, welcome them. They'll leave you wiser, stronger, and more capable than you were the day before. When you make a mistake, be grateful for the things it taught you. Resolve to use that lesson to help you reach your goals.\nAnd always follow the rules, even the little ones. When you follow the rules, life works. If you think you ever really get by with breaking the rules, you're only fooling yourself.\nIt's also important to decide exactly what you want. Then keep your mind focused on it, and be prepared to receive it.\nBut be ready to end up in some new places, too. As you grow with the years, you'll be given bigger shoes to fill. So be ready for endings as well as challenging beginnings.\nSometimes we have to be brave enough to move from the familiar to the unfamiliar. Life isn't just reaching peaks. Part of it is moving from one peak to the next. If you rest too long in between, you might be tempted to quit. Leave the past in the past. Climb the next mountain and enjoy the view.\nRemember that your choices will create your successes and your failures. So consider all the pathways ahead, and decide which ones to follow. Then believe in yourself, get up, and get going.\nAnd be sure to take breaks once in a while. They'll give you a renewed commitment to your dreams and a cheerful, healthy perception of the things that matter the most of you.\nMost important of all, never give up on yourself. The person that ends up a winner is the one who resolves to win.Give life everything you've got, and life will give its best back to you.\nLove always,\nGrandpa", "id": "high7926.txt"}
