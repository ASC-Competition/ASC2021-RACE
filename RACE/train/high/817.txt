She sought many wise people to help her understand why she was so bad that her mother hurt her and why she was unable to be better so that men wouldn't hurt her.\nShe was on a journey that she thought was to help her be \"better\". She carried a big bag with her everywhere she went. Inside it were all the hurts she had experienced. Because she was so eager to please those who offered their wisdom, she willingly agreed with what they said about forgiving. But she held that bag of hurts tightly.\nAfter 50 years of carrying that bag around and showing it to all she met as if it were proof that she was a good person, she decided to open it up and just see what happened.\nWhen she looked inside it was filled with bits of paper. At one time they had words on them, detailing the hurts. But time had faded   the words and all that was left was some useless paper. She had been struggling to carry this bag that held nothing but the image of something that once was.\nShe saw the absurdity of carrying that bag around. It made her laugh. By letting go of the paper and having pity for those that hurt her, this little girl was able to become a woman with beautiful hair. The woman looked in the mirror and said, \"I am lovable.\"\nAlthough it took many years, she was finally open to bringing love and respect into her life.", "id": "high817.txt"}
