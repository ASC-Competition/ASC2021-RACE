At age 24, he was a part-time player for the Stockbridge Park Steels, earning only PS30 (293 yuan) a week.\nFast forward to 2015, Vardy is Leicester City's star striker and only the second player in the history of the Premier League to score in eleven matches in a row.\nNow 28, Vardy has gone from an underdog to a superstar. Even he is surprised by his sudden rise to fame.\n\"I didn't expect it to happen in a million years, to be honest with you,\" he told The Telegraph.\nHis career started with rejection. His local soccer club Sheffield Wednesday let Vardy go at age 16, believing him to be too small to play professionally.\nThen he found a part-time job at Stockbridge Park Steels, a soccer team in a lower league. He trained two evenings a week after working in a carbon fiber factory. Vardy lived like this until 2010.\nHis story is an unusual one, especially because of the highly competitive nature of European soccer. It is often said that if a player can't get a professional contract   by his early 20s, he will never be a star. Many of today's soccer stars were successful at a young age. Lionel Messi was named FIFA World Player of the Year at the age of 22. A 23-year-old, Neymar, is a star in the Barcelona team.\nBut Vardy's late start didn't stop him from dreaming of greatness.\n\"The secret's just lots and lots of hard work and the motivation that is exactly what I want to be doing,\" Vardy told The Telegraph. \"It's putting it all into the practice on the training field.\"", "id": "high19745.txt"}
