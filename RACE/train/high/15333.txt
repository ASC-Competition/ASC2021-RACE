Past\"newcomer\"experiences had been difficult, so I was\nvery anxious to fit in.\nLunchtime was a pleasant surprise when the girls all crowded around my table. Their chat was friendly, so\nI began to relax. My new classmates filled me in on the school, the teachers and the other kids. it wasn't long\nbefore the class herd was pointed out to me: Mary Lou. Actually she called herself Mary Louise. A\nformal, overmodest young girl with old-fashioned clothes, she wasn't ugly--not even funny looking. Practical\nshoes, long wool skirt and a blouse completed the image of a complete herd. The girls' whispers got louder and\nlouder. Mary Lou didn't notice this. After school, the girls invited me to join them in front of the school.\nArms wrapped around her backpack, Mary Lou came down the school steps. The _ began--rude,\nbiting comments and disrespectful words from the girls. I paused, then joined right in. My force began to pick\nup as I approached her, mean remarks falling from my lips. I even pulled the belt of her backpack and then\npushed her. The belt broke, Mary Lou fell. Everyone was laughing and patting me. I fit in. But I was not proud.\nSomething inside me hurt.\nMary Lou got up, gathered her books and--without a tear shed--off, she went. She held her head high as a\nsmall trickle of blood ran down from her injured knee.\nI turned to leave with my laughing friends and noticed a man standing beside his car. His skin, dark hair\nand handsome features told me this was her father. Respectful of Mary Lou's proud spirit, he remained still and\nwatched the lonely girl walk toward him. Only his eyes--shining with both grief and pride--followed. As I\npassed, he looked at me in silence with burning tears that spoke to my shame and scolded my heart. He didn't\nspeak a word.\nNo scolding from a teacher or a parent could linger as much as that hurt in my heart from the day a\nfather's eyes taught me kindness and strength and dignity. I never again joined the cruel herds. I never\nagain hurt someone for my own gain.", "id": "high15333.txt"}
