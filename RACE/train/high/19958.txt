The self-made billionaire said he felt stupid for not knowing any foreign languages.\nSpeaking in his third Ask Me Anything question-and-answer session for online forum Reddit , the Microsoft founder said that he wished he spoke French, Arabic or Chinese.\nHe said: \"I took Latin and Greek in high school and got A's and I guess it helps my vocabulary. I keep hoping to get time to study one of these--probably French because it is the easiest. I did Duolingo for a while but didn't keep it up.\"\nGates, who is worth $79.3 billion, praised Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg for surprising an audience in Beijing when he spoke fluent Chinese. \"Mark Zuckerberg amazingly learned Chinese and did a Q&A with Chinese students--unbelievable, isn't it?\" he said\nThis isn't the first time for Gates to admit his regret over language. He also showed his habits at home and personal insights.\nLast February, Gates said he likes to do the dishes himself--to his own special standards every night and also told the interviewer that his wife, Melinda, would likely want Samuel L. Jackson to play her husband in a biopic . \nHe also admitted that he would pick up a $100 bill if he found it on the street.\nAs he took the top spot on Forbes 28th Annual Billionaires list last year for the fourth time, he said he is pretty basic when it comes to so ending on clothes and food, but that he enjoys investing in shoes andracquets when he plays tennis.\nWhen asked a life lesson he had to learn the hard way, the billionaire said staying up too late is a habit he is still trying to break. \"Don't stay up too late even if the book is really exciting. You will regret it in the morning. Pam still working on this problem.\" he said.", "id": "high19958.txt"}
