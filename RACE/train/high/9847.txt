Alan Beck, an expert in human-animal relationship, and Nancy Edwards, a professor of nursing, are leading the animal-assisted study concerning the influence of robotic dogs on old people's depression, physical activity, and life satisfaction. \"No one will argue that an older person is better off being more active, challenged, or stimulated  ,\" Edwards points out. \"The problem is how we promote (......) that, especially for those without friends or help. A robotic dog could be a solution.\"\nIn the study, the robot, called AIBO, is placed for six weeks in the houses of some old people who live alone. Before placing AIBO in the home, researchers will collect baseline data for six weeks. These old people will keep a diary to note their feelings and activity before and after AIBO. Then, the researchers will review the data to determine if it has inspired any changes in the life of its owner.\n\"I talk to him all the time, and he responds to my voice,\" says a seventy-year-old lady. \"When I'm watching TV, he'll stay in my arms until he wants down. He has a mind of his own.\"\nThe AIBOs respond to certain orders. The researchers say they have some advantages over live dogs, especially for old people. Often the elderly are disabled and cannot care for an animal by walking it or playing with it. A robotic dog removes exercise and feeding concerns.\n\"At the beginning, it was believed that no one would relate to the robotic dog, because it was metal and not furry, \" Beck says. \"But it's amazing how quickly we have given up that belief.\"\n\"Hopefully, down the road, these robotic pets could become a more-valuable health helper. They will record their masters' blood pressure, oxygen levels, or heart rhythms. AIBOs may even one day have games that can help stimulate older people's minds. \"", "id": "high9847.txt"}
