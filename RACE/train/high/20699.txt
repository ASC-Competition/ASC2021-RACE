For example, Australia and the United States use a driving licence   to identify people.\nIdentity cards are introduced for a variety of reasons. Race, politics and religion were often at the heart of older ID systems. In recent years, though, ID cards have been linked to national information databases, which form the basis of how a government manages a country.\nThe US, Britain and some other countries are considering a national ID system as a way of preventing possible terrorist attacks.\nHowever, such plans have been .met with fierce   resistance by those who believe identity cards work against human rights and individual privacy   .\n\"ID cards make us suspects  , not citizens,\" said UK human rights group Liberty.", "id": "high20699.txt"}
