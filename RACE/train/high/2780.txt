That's where the language was first spoken. But England is often called by other names. This often confuses people and I wonder if you know what these names mean. So, now I would like to tell you about this matter of names. I believe that you have heard people use the names--England, Britain or Great Britain. Let's see what each of these names means.\nIf you look at a map of Europe, you'll see a group of islands--one larger island off the northwest coast, one smaller and many tiny ones. These make up what is called the British Isles. The largest island of the British Isles is Britain. It is also called Great Britain. The smaller island is Ireland.\nBritain is divided into three parts: Scotland, Wales and England. But sometimes the word \"England\" is used instead of \"Britain\". Why so?\nIn ancient times, what is Britain now used to be three different countries. People in these different countries spoke different languages. Over many years the three countries became one. England is the largest and richest of the three and it has the most people. So the English people take it for granted that their own name stands for the whole island.\nThere's another thing that confuses people: sometimes you may hear people say \"the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". That is the official name of the country. Northern Ireland is only one sixth of the island of Ireland. The rest of the island is an independent state, called the Republic of Ireland. So we have the names of \"England\", \"Britain\", \"Great Britain\", and \"the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". Now do you know what each of them means?", "id": "high2780.txt"}
