But she did not write news. She told her stories with a camera. Margaret Bourke-White began her career as an industrial photographer in the early 1930s. In 1936, she accepted the American publisher Henry Luce's invitation and went to his magazine, called Life, and later another magazine called Fortune.\nIn the 1930s, Margaret Bourke-White met the American writer Erskine Caldwell. They decided to produce a book about poor country people of the South. They traveled through eight states. Their book, You Have Seen Their Faces, was published in 1937. It was a great success.\nIn 1938, some countries in Europe were close to war. Margaret Bourke-White and Caldwell went there to report on these events. The next year they got married.\nDuring the World War Two, she became an official photographer with the United States Army. Her photographs were to be used jointly by the military  and by Life magazine. She was the first woman to be permitted to work at the front during World War Two.\nAfter the war, she went to India and took a famous photograph of Mohandas Gandhi called \"Gandhi at His Spinning Wheel\". She was the last person to photograph Gandhi before he was murdered in 1948.\nOften, Margaret Bourke-White was not satisfied with what she had done. She would look at her pictures and see something she had failed to do, or something she had not done right. Reaching perfection was not easy. Many things got in the way of her work. She said, \"There is only one moment when a picture is there. And a moment later, it is gone forever. My memory is full of those pictures that were lost.\"", "id": "high17476.txt"}
