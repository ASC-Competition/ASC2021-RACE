Children under two should not watch any TV. The longer they sit in front of the box, the worse their behavior becomes.\nJust having the TV on in the background, even if the child wasn't watching it, was also connected to troublemaking behavior although the relationship wasn't as strong, said the researchers.\n\"Parents should be smart about TV use,\" researcher Jennifer Manganello from the University at Albany, New York, said.\n\"They should limit the time that children use TV, pay attention to the content of TV programs, and consider how TV is used throughout the home.\"\nThe study looked at 3,128 women from 20 U.S. cities who had a child between 2005 and 2008.\nWhile there was some diversity of education among the women, one-third hadn't graduated from high school.\nTwo-thirds of the mothers said their three-year-old watched more than two hours of TV a day, and the average viewing time for children was around three hours. On average, the TV was on for about five additional hours on a common day.\nAfter accounting for factors such as living in a violent neighborhood, scientists also found watching TV was strongly connected to behavior such as hitting others, having angry moods, being disobedient , and screaming a lot.\nThe researchers thought that children may see violence on TV, and spend less time on positive development tasks such as reading or playing.\nThe American Academy of Paediatrics suggests no TV at all for children at two and younger, and two hours a day or less for older kids.", "id": "high769.txt"}
