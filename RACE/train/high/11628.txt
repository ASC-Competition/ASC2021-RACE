As I came near to the gates I turned off the head lights of the car so as to prevent the beam from swinging   through the window and waking Jack, who shared the house with me. But I needn't have done so. I noticed that his light was still on, so he was awake anyway--unless he had fallen asleep while reading. I put the car away and went up the steps.\nThen I opened the door quietly and went to Jack's room. He was in bed awake, but he didn't even turn towards me.\n\"What's up, Jack?\" I asked.\n\"For God's sake, don't make a noise,\" he said.\nThe way he spoke reminded me of someone in pain who is afraid to talk in case he does himself serious injury.\n\"Take your shoes off, Neville,\" Jack said.\nI thought that he must be ill and that I had better give way to him to keep him happy. \"There is a snake here,\" he explained. \"It's asleep between the sheets. I was lying on my back reading when I saw it.I knew that moving was _ . I could not have moved even I'd wanted to.\" I realized that he was serious. \"I was depending on you to call a doctor as soon as you came home,\" Jack went on. \"It has not bitten me yet but I dare not do anything to upset it. It might wake up. I'm sick of this,\" he said.\"I took it for granted that you would have come home an hour ago.\"\nThere was no time to argue or apologize for being late.I looked at him as encouraging as I could and went to telephone the doctor.", "id": "high11628.txt"}
