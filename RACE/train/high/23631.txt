If it takes more than five seconds for a website to load, we won't view it. We want to call our friends now, even if we'll see them in 10 minutes. The \"now\" culture is one of convenience, and let's face it, convenience can make our lives easier. \nUnfortunately, by gaining convenience, we've lost some of our patience. If you're like me, patience does not come naturally. Here are a few tips I've learned along the way to cultivate more patience in my life:\n     Ask yourself why you're in a hurry. If you feel rushed while going about your normal day, ask yourself why. Will the world end if you get home five minutes late? What if you stop to talk to the random people you meet each day? If you do stop to talk, you'll be amazed how much more connected you'll feel to your community.\nHang around people who have patience. I had a lot less patience before I met my husband. Being around him daily has certainly given me a greater appreciation for the art of waiting. He's not only a great example of someone who lives his life patiently, but he tells me if I'm getting too anxious or impatient. If you don't know someone who's patient in your immediate circle of friends, take a class like yoga where meditation is part of the art.\n _ . Sometimes you can lose sight of long-term goals in the rush towards instant gratification. Most people trying to lose weight have a hard time cutting out sugary or carb-loaded foods completely. It helps to cut these lofty long-term goals into smaller chunks. To encourage weight loss, you can slowly cut back on your calorie intake or increase your exercise regimen each week. Whatever route you take, setting those little goals will help you achieve the big ones faster.\nThink of the things you've gained by being patient. When all else fails, I think of the good things that have happened in my life because I waited. Passing up on a few \"so-so\" job offers last year paved the way for me to land a job I really wanted. When you can think of positive outcomes that have come from waiting, it puts into perspective why it's not always the best strategy to rush into things.", "id": "high23631.txt"}
