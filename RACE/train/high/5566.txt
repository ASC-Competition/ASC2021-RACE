Poor empress.\" \"Do you think Zhen Huan really loves the emperor?\" From campuses to offices, from shopping malls to the streets, talk about Legend of Zhen Huan is everywhere.\nUnlike other long TV series, Legend of Zhen Huan, the 76-episode Qing dynasty drama series, has kept attracting new audiences along the way. It has enjoyed widespread popularity on the Chinese mainland over the past months.\nThe story is seemingly the same as those dramas which look into the lives of women in the imperial palace. _ focuses on plots and intrigues  within the Inner Palace during Emperor Yongzheng's reign.\nThe heroine, Zhen Huan, initially a kind and innocent young lady, enters the emperor's harem  of concubines. Discovering that the palace is a cruel and harsh place, Zhen learns how to survive on her own.\nHowever, Legend of Zhen Huan seems to arouse more discussion than any drama series. Why?

And as a newcomer to the palace, she finds herself caught in the fierce infighting and she has to survive,\" Niu said, \"Everyone may find themselves in Zhen's position at a certain point.\"\nThen it's not hard to understand why the story of Zhen Huan is even seen as a survival guide for newcomers in the workplace. Its director, Zheng Xiaolong, once admitted that in terms of society today, the \"promotion\" of Zhen Huan reflects a person's career path in some way. \"Whether the principles can be applied in today's society, or not, I want to make the story as real as possible,\" Zheng told Sina.com. \"There are many fairytale-like series that make audiences ignore or avoid reality, and the complexity of humanity.\" \"But Legend of Zhen Huan, is a series that makes you think.\"", "id": "high5566.txt"}
