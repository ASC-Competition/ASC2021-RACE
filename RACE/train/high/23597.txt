But are we traveling with the kids? Here's how the down economy is changing the way we travel.\nSECONDARY CITIES\nSome smaller cities are stealing the glory . Fort Myers,Fla.experienced double digit   growth in January 2009 over January 2008, based on American Express Travel bookings. Cities like Portland,Ore.are also becoming popular destinations, with Travelocity data showing an increase of 38% over last year. EvenPhiladelphia's star is rising, said Travelocity senior editor Shaw Brown.\nBrown said it's hard to explain exactly the reason for the  _ : it could be a decrease in airfare or hotel prices or excellent marketing. Hotel rates inFort Myersare down about 10%. But hotel rates inPortlandare up, she said. She thinksPhiladelphia's higher popularity is due to good marketing, a decrease in airfare of 16% compared to the overall 8% decrease for domestic flights and more interest in historic destinations in general.\nFAMILY TRAVEL\nRather than take a two-week vacation to Europe, families are going to national parks.\nDavid Mandt, spokesman for the Association of Amusement Parks, is cautiously optimistic about the summer season. He said even when gas was $4 a gallon in 2008, people continued to visit theme parks--they simply selected parks closer to their homes. \nWhile for years, park operators have used special offers, promotions and discounts to encourage families to visit at a specific time, the deals may be easier to find this year, especially when it comes to packages that include accommodations. Universal Orlando Resort has a deal allowing families to book a three-night package and receive two additional nights free. Packages include accommodations at a hotel near Universal and unlimited theme park admission to both Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure.", "id": "high23597.txt"}
