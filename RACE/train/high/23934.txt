But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners:\n*Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\"\n*Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \"lecture time\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too.\n*Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear   unless you want your kids to do the same.\n*Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\"\n*Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners.\n*Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners.\n*Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip.", "id": "high23934.txt"}
