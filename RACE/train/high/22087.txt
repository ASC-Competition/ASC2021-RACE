So I think that being beautiful is the only way to become a success.\n     As I grew up,the story of my best friend made me realize that outer beauty was not so important to make a person successful.She as so beautiful a girl that every classmate liked to chat with her,but she was very arrogant.In her opinion,she could get all she wanted because of her beauty, but all of her friends left her one by one! Only then did she come to know the importance of the beauty in a person's heart,which changed her attitude and she made friends again. \nTurning on TV,we can see many advertisements,most of which seem to give us a feeling that,physical attractiveness is the most important thing.T _ .It is surprising that more and more people,especially girls and women, try it like the first man-made beauty in China, Hao Lulu.It is a common sense that attractive people can easily find work.Most good looking guys,usually get higher scores in the job interviews. But, what is real beauty? I want to say that is inner beauty because those who have beauty in their soul are really beautiful persons.\n  As is known, the beauty judged with eyes is temporary,so we should concentrate on inner beauty. And if we make the efforts to make our minds beautiful,we'll live a happier life.", "id": "high22087.txt"}
