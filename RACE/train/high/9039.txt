Business people, political leaders, university professors, and especially millions of grass-roots Americans are taking part in the movement. \"The understanding has increased many, many times,\" says Gaylord Nelson, the former governor from Wisconsin, who thought up the first Earth Day.\nAccording to US government reports, emissions  from cars and trucks have dropped from 10.3 million tons a year to 5.5 tons. The number of cities producing CO beyond the standard has been reduced from 40 to 9. Although serious problems still remain and need to be dealt with, the world is a safer and healthier place. A kind of \"Green thinking \" has become part of practices.\nGreat improvement has been achieved. In 1988 there were only 600 recycling programs, today in 1995 there are about 6,600. Advanced lights, motors, and building designs have helped save a lot of energy and therefore prevented pollution.\nTwenty-five years ago, there were hardly any education programs for environment. Today, it's hard to find a public school, university, or law school that does not have such a kind of program. \"Until we do that, nothing else will change!\" says Bruce Anderson.", "id": "high9039.txt"}
