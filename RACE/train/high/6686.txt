Last year, the world spent  $80 billion on electricity to power all these household electronics, the energy agency said.\n\" Most of the increase in consumer electronics will be in developing countries, where economic growth is the fastest and ownership rates of gadgets are the lowest , \" Waide said.\n\"This will _ efforts to increase energy security and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.\" the agency said. Existing technologies' could cut down gadgets' energy consumption by more than 30 percent at no cost or by more than 50 percent at a small cost, the agency estimates, meaning total greenhouse gas emissions  from households' electronic gadgets could be held stable  at around 500 million tons of CO2 per year.", "id": "high6686.txt"}
