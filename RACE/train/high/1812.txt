When he was 3, Mark was reading fluently, mostly self-taught. His parents haven't been able to keep him away from books since.\n\"I tried many times to stop him reading. We worry about his crazy fond of reading because he constantly wants to read every-thing whatever it is.\"\nA psychologist at the Centre for gifted children tested Mark and gave him an IQ of 200. The average child of Mark's age has an IQ of 100. At 200, Mark is a genius-even compared with other child geniuses.\n\"With children like Mark you can tell that's a bright child as soon as they walk in. They just have this sort of intensity, and maybe they're not so good at communicating with people,\" the psychologist said. \"He will never fit perfectly into a class where he's with children of his age.\"But Mark's mother worries about the \"socially isolated\" labels. \"Nobody wants their child to grow up with that image. I want him to communicate with others freely, but not to be frustrated academically, so it's really hard to find a balance,\" she says.\nHelen Dudeney from the Talented and Gifted Children Association says Mark is one in a million with such a high IQ. She points out that geniuses are still rare and difficult for the public education system to handle. \"The lack of coping comes because teachers aren't trained in teaching gifted children,\" says Dudeney.\nHelen believes it's also extremely important for them to be recognized and supported in their talents. Mark's parents are trying to figure out how best to help Mark. At the moment, there are few options. Mark finds first year work boring and simple, but he must learn to complete the work. His mother says, \"We just want to be happy. Just to have a happy childhood and want to go to school every day.\"", "id": "high1812.txt"}
