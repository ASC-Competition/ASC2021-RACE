They talk on the phone all the time and don't like each other. But then they communicate by mail and fall in love. This movie will be very popular with teenagers and people who like romances. It also has beautiful music.\nv  I Scream\nIn the movie, Paul (acted by Colin Jacks) is a young man who joins a thriller club. Each of the members tries to frighten the others. Paul is told to stay in an old house for the night. Everyone who had tried to stay in the house before has died. This movie is very frightening but also quite silly. It doesn't make sense for Paul to stay in the house when things start to go wrong. Only for people who like thrillers.\nv  Paul's Heros \nThis is a very funny war movie set in World War Two. Six soldiers (including Sammy Turblow) have to get to Italy to take secret message to the American army there. During the movie, they dress up as women and fight with Italian workers. You can guess the ending, but it's great fun getting there.\nv   _ \nThis is a very good drama with Jake Ross, who plays a hard-working truck driver. His wife becomes ill and he has to find a doctor who can help her. In his travels he meets Dr. Lioyd (acted by Phil Driver) who has found the cure for the illness, but Jack Ross has only twelve hours to get the medicine back to his wife on the other side of America. This is an excellent movie, which is very exciting and well worth seeing again.", "id": "high22201.txt"}
