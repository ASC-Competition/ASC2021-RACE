Finally, there was only one family between the ticket office and us. This family made a big impression on me.\nThere were eight children, all probably under the age of 12. You could tell they didn't have a lot of money. _ The children talked excitedly about the clowns. It was clearly a very important day out for them. The father and mother seemed happy as they could be.\nThe tickets lady asked how many tickets the father wanted, he proudly answered, \"Please let me buy eight children's tickets and two adults' tickets, so I can take my family to the circus.\"\nThe ticket lady told him the price.\nThe man's wife lowered her head. There was no longer a smile on the man's face. He quietly asked, \"How much did you say?\"\nThe ticket lady again told him the price.\nThe man obviously didn't have enough money. But how could he tell his kids the bad news?\nSeeing what was happening, my dad took a $20 note from his pocket and dropped in on the ground. (We were not rich ourselves at all!) He then tapped the man on the shoulder and said, \"Excuse me, sir, you dropped this.\"\nThe man understood my father was helping him. He picked up the money, looked straight into my dad's eyes, and in tears replied. \"Thank you. This really means a lot to me and my family.\"\nAlthough we did not go to the circus that night, we didn't go without.", "id": "high5008.txt"}
