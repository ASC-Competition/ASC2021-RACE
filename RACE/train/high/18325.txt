I turned into a sock shop that caught my eye, and a boy clerk who was about 17 came forward. \"What can I do for you, sir?\" There was a note of passion in his voice.  \"Did you know that you have come into the finest place in the world to buy socks? Come with me,\" said the boy.

I have come to the conclusion that the surest road to failure is to do things mechanically .", "id": "high18325.txt"}
