Its collections, which number more than 13 million objects, are amongst the largest and most comprehensive in the world and originate from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginning to the present.\nThe British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759 in Montagu House in Bloomsbury, on the site of the current museum building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of an expanding British colonial footprint and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions. Until 1997, when the British Library (previously centered on the Round Reading Room)moved to a new site, the British Museum housed both a national museum of antiquities and a national library in the same building. The museum is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Since 2002 the director of the museum has been Neil MacGregor.\nAdmission and opening hours:\nThe museum is open every day from 10am to 6pm (Fridays 10am to 5:30pm)and it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions.\nHow to get there:\nBy train: 7:00-18:30 every day.\n    By Underground: 8:00-18:30 every day.\n    By bus: 7:30-18:30 every day.\n    By coach: 7:00--19:30 every day.\n    Nearest underground stations:\n    Tottenham Court Road (500m)\n    Holborn (500m)\n    Russell Square (800m)", "id": "high17803.txt"}
