It showed that present economic conditions are discouraging young adults from leaving home and forcing those who have already gone, so-called boomerang kids, to return.\n\"Parents are continuing their financial involvement longer than we expected,\" said Ted Beck, president of National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE).\nAbout 60 percent of parents questioned in the survey said they're helping their adult children who are no longer in school financially. Half are providing housing and nearly half are helping with living expenses.\nFor an increasing number of adult children, the situation is bad. Two-thirds of adult children, aged 18 to 39, who are not in school said they faced tougher financial pressures than previous generations, according to the survey. And nearly one-third of parents agreed that it was easier for them to find their financial feet than for their children.\nParents are helping their children out of genuine concern because they do not want to see them struggle. But Beck said that parents who make sacrifices  to help their adult children should be careful about their own finances.\n\"If you are taking on extra debt or delaying  retirement to help your adult child, you could be making a mistake and putting your own financial future in danger,\" Beck warned.\nBoomerang children can also cause other problems for their parents. Thirty percent of parents said they had given up privacy since their adult children moved back home, while more than a quarter have taken on added debt, and seven percent have delayed retirement. But the survey also showed 42 percent of adult children living at home are helping with the cooking and cleaning.", "id": "high3578.txt"}
