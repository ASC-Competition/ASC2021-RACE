Whenever the villagers had a problem, they would climb up the mountain and ask the old man for advice.\nOne day a young man arrived. \"Wise man,\" he asked, \"What makes a man truly great?\"\nThe old man said, \"Do you sincerely want to know?\"\n\"Yes, yes!\" the young man replied.\n\"Well,\" the wise old man said to him, \"Let me tell you in the form of a story.\"\nThere was once a Greek man who suffered from a deadly disease. Knowing that he would die soon, he was the first to join the army when his country was in a battle with the enemy. Hoping to die in battle, he would fight in the front line, risking himself without any worry for his life. Finally they won the battle and he was still alive. His general   was so impressed with his bravery which contributed much to the victory.\nThe general decided to promote him and award him with medals of bravery and honor. On the day of presentation  , he was looking very down and sad. Curiously, the general asked him why he was so sad on a day he should be so proud. The soldier told him of his deadly disease. \"How could I let such a brave soldier die?\" the general thought. So the general hired the best physician and finally cured the soldier. But from that day on, the once _ soldier was no longer seen at the front. He would always avoid danger and tried his best to protect his life.\n\"Young man,\" the wise man said, \"if you want to be truly great, you must not be afraid of dying, you must be daring.\"", "id": "high8019.txt"}
