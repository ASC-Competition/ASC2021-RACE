He held up a sign which said, \"I am blind. Please help me.\" There were only a few coins in the hat.\nA man was walking by. He took out a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote something on it. He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by could see the new words. Soon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy. That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were. The boy recognized his footsteps and asked, \"Are you the one who changed my sign this morning? May I know what you wrote?\" The man said, \"I only wrote the truth, I said what you said but in a different way.\" What he had written was, \"Today is a beautiful day but I cannot see it.\"\nOf course both signs told people the boy was blind. But the first sign simply said the boy was a blind. The second sign told people they were so lucky that they were not blind. It reminded you to be thankful for what you have. When life gives you a 100 reasons to cry, show life that you have 1,000 reasons to smile. Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear. Keep the faith and drop the fear. The most beautiful thing is to see a person smiling.", "id": "high245.txt"}
