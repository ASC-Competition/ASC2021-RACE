I hope you don't think I have forgotten you. There have been so many places to see and so many things to do that I've not had much time for writing letters. I shall soon start my studies at King's College.\n  So far I've been learning about British ways of living. I won' tell you about London in a traditional way, because there are plenty of books you can read and plenty of pictures you can look at. I'm sure you'll be more interested to know what I think about the life here. I find some of the customs new and interesting. People here do not shake hands so much as we do in Asia. During the first few weeks I was often surprised because people did not put out their hands when I met them. Men raised their hats to women, but not to each other.\nYours ever,\n Anne", "id": "high16600.txt"}
