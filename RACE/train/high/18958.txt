It was an audition   in which people had exactly two minutes each to perform for a producer.\nI am not a comic, have never appeared onstage, am awkward before many people, and have no social skills. But I have written some funny things in the newspapers, and I figured that if you can write funny, you can be funny. That was my first mistake.\nGood stand - up comics improve their acts over months if not years, practicing before bathroom mirrors or their friends. I developed the key skill the morning I went on. I also brought a box of plastic beads   , because I figured they could be useful.\nFor the first few seconds, I was simply staring forward, mouth open, expressing the concept:\"Uuungh\".\nFinally I said, \"This is my first performance as a stand - up comic. It's a kind of a special moment for me. I'd like to take this opportunity to say something to my mother, who was an inspiration   to me throughout my life. My mother passed away a few years ago, but I feel she is still with me. All the time, wherever I go, I feel her presence. Day in and day out. So I would like to say this to her. LEAVE ME ALONE, MA!\"\nSome people actually laughed. \nThen I said, \"Anyway, this really is my first time onstage, and I'm pretty nervous because I'm not all that funny and I have a really bad stage presence. But I've been working on the problem. A long time ago a Greek guy named Demosthenes had the same problem I have, and he became a great speaker by sticking pebbles   in his mouth, so I thought I would (and here I began putting\nthe beads in my mouth) try that. See, the idea is that if you can talk through the pebbles ( now I was putting them in by the handful) you can learn to talk better and wfnm fmuff frmphm grphnm . . .\"\nMore laughter.\nI looked at my watch, said something that might have sounded like \"My time is up,\" and left to somewhat spirited applause. What the audience did not know was that I was quietly choking   on a slippery bead.", "id": "high18958.txt"}
