That's what I learnt when I started to work as a private investigator 10 years ago.People pay restaurant bills with their bank card,check into hotels or travel around. In every case,they leave a trace.And because of this,I'm able to track them down even when they don't want to be found.\nThe first thing I do when I want to find out where someone is staying is to go to the neighbourhood where he used to live.It's human nature to tell stories--which is why neighbours will tell me all they know when I ring at their houses.Sometimes,someone even talks about his friend's dishonesty.Then I produce a pattern of my subject's life:if he likes to have a holiday in Spain or in Italy,if he prefers two- or three- star hotels and where he might hide his assets .When I've got this life pattern,I start my rescarch.\nNine times out of l0,I find the people I'm looking for.I once investigated a lorry supplier who owed PS500,000 to a subcontractor .The subcontractor wanted to find out if it was worth bringing charges against the supplier.I found out the supplier had moved assets to his son,who founded a new company offering the same product.It was a11 done within the law.There was no money to be got from that operation.\nHowever, I asked the son if I could speak to his father and he told me that his parent was on a long holiday in Spain and wouldn't be back for a while.It didn't take me long to find out that the father wasn't in Spain. \nI went back to the son and this time he told me that his father might be in Bulgaria,and I found him doing winter sports in a beautiful mountain area.He was 1iving in a big house on a 1arge piece of land he had bought for ie 400,000.This was exactly the kind of asset my customer was loooking for.", "id": "high21445.txt"}
