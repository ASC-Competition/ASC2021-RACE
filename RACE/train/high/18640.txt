Green building can also refer to environmentally friendly houses, factories, and offices. Green building means \"reducing the effect of the building on the land,\" Taryn Holowka of the US Green Building Council in prefix = st1 /Washington,DC, said.\nAccording to Holowka, buildings account for 65 percent of total USelectricity use. But green buildings can reduce energy and water use. Also, the buildings are often located near public transportation such as buses and subways, so that people can drive their cars less. That could be good for the environment, because cars use lots of natural resources, such as gasoline, and give off pollution.\nGreen buildings are often built on developed land, so that the buildings don't destroy forests or other wild habitats. Marty Dettling is project manager for a building that put these ideas into action. The Solaire has been called the country's first green residential high-rise building.\nAccording to Dettling, \"We've reduced our energy consumption by one-third and our water by 50 percent.\nThe Solaire cuts energy in part by using solar power. The Solaire also has lights that automatically turn off  when people leave the room. Plus, the building has lots of windows. This allows people to use the sun for light instead of lamps during the day.", "id": "high18640.txt"}
