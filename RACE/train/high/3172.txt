Its pricing scheme is concerned with both the sector's normal operation and development, as well as the daily traveling and vital interests of the general public.\nThe state will be very cautious in making any price adjustment in the railway sector, taking into account various factors including operation, construction, public acceptance and coordinated development with other modes of transport, according to the NDRC official.\nUnder Chinese law and regulations, hearings will be held before adjustments in the basic passenger train ticket fare, Cao said.\nIn China's latest railway reform, endorsed at the just-concluded annual session of the country's top legislature, the former MOR was dismantled into two parts, with the newly created CRC carrying out business functions and a state railways administration fulfilling administrative functions.", "id": "high3172.txt"}
