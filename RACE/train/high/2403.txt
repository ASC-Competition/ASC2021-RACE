The following ways might help improve their listening ability.\nFirst of all, do things step by step. It is not good to listen to something beyond your level. Better choose a suitable course and start with the first book. Go on to the second book only after you are sure you understand the first one.\nSecondly, stick to one course of study. Don't change books often.
