Elizabeth looked down. \"Is it from Harvard? They refused my application once.\" Emily answered, \"No, it's from Yale.\" Quickly, Elizabeth walked downstairs. She took the letter and opened it. \"Rejected again,\" Elizabeth said unhappily. \"Who says women can't be doctors?\"\n\"They are fools not to accept you. You can't let them stop you, Lizzie,\" Emily said.\n\"I won't. I'll apply to   Geneva Medical College,\" Elizabeth told her sister. As it turned out, the professors at Geneva Medical College were not fools. They allowed Elizabeth Blackwell to study medicine.\nIn 1848, a year before Elizabeth would graduate, a typhoid epidemic   broke out in New York. Elizabeth wrote to Emily. \"There's an outbreak   of typhoid, and I am going to help. It is dangerous, so if I should not survive, please do me the honor of studying medicine yourself.\"\nEmily replied, \"Encouraged by your dream and success, I have decided to study in medical school, as well.\"\nHaving survived the disease, Elizabeth tried to set up a private medical practice. \"I graduated first in my class but no one believes a woman can be a good doctor,\" she said to Emily one day. \"All I hear is that doctors should be men, while women should stay home to cook and clean.\"\nEmily said worriedly, \"I will graduate in June with my medical degree. What shall we do?\" Elizabeth thought for a while and replied, \"There's a big house in the poor part of our town. We can practice medicine there for people who couldn't afford care.\"\nSoon with the help of some friends, Elizabeth and Emily bought the house and opened a hospital for poor women and children. \"We'll have an all-women staff  ,\" Elizabeth said. \"And later, we'll add a medical college for women!\" Emily added. At last, Elizabeth realized her dream of being a doctor.", "id": "high3900.txt"}
