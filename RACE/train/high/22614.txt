They were more interested in my story of success, such as how I was able to create the nation's largest firm for millions of dollars. That's the story everyone wanted me to write, but it's not the story I wanted to tell.\nLooking back, I see so clearly how often, throughout my boyhood, I was touched by random acts of kindness that helped shape me into the man I am today. And random acts of violence and ignorance played just a powerful lawyer involves hard work, bur escaping generational poverty is the hardest thing I ever done.\nI chose to write the story of my childhood years in poverty, with the hope that a child somewhere in the world will read my story and be inspired to break the cycle of poverty. My publisher was quick to point out that the market would be small for a memoir written by a  ly unknown author. To everyone's surprise, the book received over 1,000 pre-publication orders one month before the scheduled launch date. The book launch scheduled for October 1, was moved up to September 14. Less than four months later, the first print run of 5,000 copies were sold out.\nToday, the memoir is being used by universities, high schools and middle schools, as a case study of the behavior patterns of the culture of poverty as well as valuable lessons on how to succeed in life. Here is a quote from the principal of a middle school in Texas on October 27, who is using my memoir for students 5th through 8th grades; \"We are halfway through your story. It is changing the lives of our students and the perspectives of our teachers.", "id": "high22614.txt"}
