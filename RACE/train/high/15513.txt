The weather is warm. They do not have to wear heavy clothes to keep warm. Young people do not have to go to school. They can do many activities outside, like playing sports and swimming at the beach or the pool. They like the sunshine during the day and the warm summer nights.

He wrote the music in nineteen thirty-five. The opera takes place in the southern United States. It opens with these words: \"Summertime and the living' is easy. Fish are jumping' and the cotton is high.\" Leontyne Price sings the song.\nThe nineteen fifties and sixties produced many songs about teenagers enjoying their summer vacation from school.
