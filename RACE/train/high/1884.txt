As any serious job-hunter knows, it helps to dress smartly and smile at that all-important interview. But research has showed that a firm handshake is what really matters when it comes to impressing potential employers.\nThe US research looked at 98 undergraduates taking part in mock   interviews with businesses. As each undergraduate was graded on their overall performance, five \"handshake raters\" also marked them on their grasp, strength, duration, vigor and eye contact.\nProfessor Greg Stewart, from the University of Iowa, who led the study, said those who scored highly with the handshake raters were also considered to be the most hirable by the interviewers. Students with \" wimpy\" shakes were judged to be more timid and less impressive.\nThe study also found women with a firm handshake were likely to be evaluated more favorably than their male counterparts.\nProfessor Stewart said: \"We've always heard that interviewers make up their mind about a person in the first two or three minutes of an interview. But we found that the first impression begins with a handshake that sets the tone for the rest of the interview. We don't consciously remember a person's handshake but it is one of the first non-verbal clues we get about the person's overall personality, and that impression is what we remember.\"\nWomen were less likely to have a highly rated handshake, partly because traditionally they shake hands less than men. But when women did possess a firm handshake, they were likely to be evaluated more favorably than their male counterparts.\nBody language experts warn, however, that the firmness needs to be just right, - as an over enthusiastic \"bone crusher\" handshake can indicate self-importance, a controlling personality and a lack of trustworthiness.\nThe handshake is thought to have originated in medieval Europe as a way for kings and knights to show that they did not intend to harm each other and possessed no hidden weapons.", "id": "high1884.txt"}
