When it comes to cleaning that part of my home, I suffer from the most serious case of avoidance  .\nThe thing is this: when I do set out to clean and re-organize my books, which seldom happens, I place myself into a really bad situation. No sooner do I take a title from the shelf, blow off the dust, and wipe down the cover than I find myself sitting on the floor with legs crossed and my back against the wall. Pretty soon books get piled up on my legs as I am reunited with old friends.\nIt is as if these books have voices, and each wants to say its piece. \"Remember me?

I couldn't understand a bit of it, but I did learn what \"laser\" meant.\nWhat I end up with when I empty my bookshelves is a cross-section   of my personal history.
