About 83 percent of them said they will find it difficult to continue operating without financial support from abroad, it said. Official statistics showed the Global Fund has given China $548 million in grants since 2003.\nXia Jing, leader of a Beijing-based grassroots organization dedicated to controlling AIDS, said: \"We were like children fostered by foreign milk. As foreign money began to be withdrawn from China, we were faced with serious financial hardships.\" Han Mengjie, executive director of Global Fund China Programs, said the Chinese government has fully recognized the important role social organizations play in controlling diseases. \"The work done and efforts made by such organizations must be sustained for a long time to supplement the government's intervention work,\"he said, \"We have to face the truth that international money for AIDS control will gradually leave China and to prepare ourselves to deal with that.\"", "id": "high2356.txt"}
