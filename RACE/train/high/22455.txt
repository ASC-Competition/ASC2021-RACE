German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers, Rottweilers, Dalmatians, Cocker Spaniels and Doberman Pinschers are preferred.\nChief Inspector Lal Senavirathne said 25 people donated their pets, but only 18 dogs could be enlisted as the others did not meet the recruitment. He said the dogs would be trained to identify explosives, search for buried mines, sniff down drugs, deal with criminals and even perform tricks for the public. The dogs will retire after serving a maximum period of eight years and will be returned to their original owners.\n\"We already have 170 dogs deployed in 30 units, including the operational area or conflict areas in the island's north and east\", Senavirathne told AFP by telephone from his headquarters in the central town of Kandy.\nHe said it was the first time they were making a public appeal because of pressure on the police kennels , which usually import about half of their annual requirement.\n\"This time, we hope to enlist about 50 dogs. They will be given six months extensive training and another six months on the job,\" he said. \"Thereafter they will be officially called Police Dogs.\"\nSri Lanka's dog population is about 2.3 million while it has 19.5 million people, and about 20,000 to 30,000 people are annually treated for homeless dog bites.", "id": "high22455.txt"}
