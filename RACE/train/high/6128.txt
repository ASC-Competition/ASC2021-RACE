The US audience will now see the award-winning robot -- along with its big brother UR10 -- for the first time.\nThe UR5 and UR10 robotic arms are aimed at small-sized companies that thought robots were too expensive and hard to operate in existing production. The robotic arms are easily moved around the production area and present a simple user interface   which lets workers quickly operate them.\nEsben Ostergaard, founder and CTO (Chief Technical Officer) at Universal Robots, explains how the robots were designed to be as user--friendly as possible:\n\"We decided to make programming easy by developing a user interface worked together with a \"teaching function\" allowing the user to simply took hold of the robot arm and show _ how a movement should be done. The robot can work in any production process very quickly. Our experience shows this is generally done in a few hours.\"\nThe robots weigh as little as 40 pounds, making it possible for them to be moved around the production area to do different tasks. The UR5 can handle a load of up to 5 kilos (11 pounds), the UR10, 10 kilos (22 pounds). As soon as a worker touches the robot arm and uses a force of at least 150 Newton, the robot arm will automatically stop operating.", "id": "high6128.txt"}
