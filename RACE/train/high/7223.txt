They're ordinary folks like you and me.\nBut am I good enough?\nI was once where you might be now. My thoughts of writing had been pushed down by self-doubt, and I didn't know where to turn for help.\nThen, I accepted a free offer from the Institute to test my writing aptitude ,and it turned out to be the inspiration I needed.\nThe promise that paid off\nThe Institute made the same promise to me that they will make to you, if you show basic writing ability:\nYou will complete at least one manuscript  suitable to hand in to a publisher by the time you finish our course.\nI really didn't expect any publication before I finished the course, but that happened. I sold three stories. And I soon discovered that was not unusual at the Institute.\nSince graduation, I have authored 34 nationally published children's books and over 300 stories and articles.\nFree test and brochure\nWe offer a free aptitude test and will send you a copy of our brochure describing our recognized home-study courses on the basis of one-on-one training.\nRealize your writing dream today. There's nothing sadder than a dream delayed until it fades forever.\nSincerely,\nKristi\nKristi Holl, Instructor\nInstitute of Children's Literature", "id": "high7223.txt"}
