Only seven of these splendid watches were ever made and these watches were almost lost to history. Today, it is so hard to get and original  watch that some watch historians are even willing to offer $200,000 for one. \nThese watches attracted a lot of people for their splendid color1, fashionable style and new uses in the 1920s.

The watchmaker has made the movement of the watch much more modern with an automatic rotor  so that the watch never needs to be wound by hand. The watch comes in a very beautiful case with a crocodile design on it. To get a watch in such a perfect design means to get a chance to know a piece of watch-making history and to wear such a watch will show your personal taste and social position. \nYou can get the watch either in person or by mail at an affordable price.
