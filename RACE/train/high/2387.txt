They successfully moved the DNA of one type of bacteria  to a yeast  cell, changed it, then put it into another bacterial cell.\n\"Bacteria have systems that protect them from foreign DNA,\" Venter explained to the BBC. In the experiment, the team managed to block this system.\nThe experiment was performed on a simple type of bacteria called Mycoplasma mycoides. The team took the bacteria's genes and put them into a yeast cell.\nPutting the DNA in a yeast cell allowed the team to change the genes----in this case, taking out a gene that was not necessary for the bacteria to live.\nThey then put the gene into a host bacteria cell. The cell went on to divide normally, producing new healthy bacteria.\nIn January, the team created artificial genes of a new type of bacteria. Their next goal is to put the artificial DNA into a host cell to create a new species, according to a report inSciencemagazine.\n\"If we don't make any errors, I think it should work and we should have the first artificial species by the end of the year,\" Venter said in the report.\nThe first artificial life from is likely to be a simple man-made bacteria, to prove that the technology can work. But that form will be followed by more complex bacteria that turn coal into cleaner natural gas, or algae that can take in carbon dioxide and change it into fuel.\nMany scientists think it's good news to have this artificial life, but others are worried that the technology to create new organisms might end up in the wrong hands, with dangerous results.", "id": "high2387.txt"}
