Many advertisements are designed to produce increased consumption of those products and services through the creation and reinforcement  of \"brand image\" and \"brand loyalty\". For these purposes, advertisements sometimes fixes their persuasive message with fact-based information. Every major medium is used to deliver these messages, including television, radio, cinema, magazines, newspapers, video games, the Internet and billboards. Advertising is often placed by an advertising agency on behalf of a company or other organization. \nOrganizations that frequently spend large sums of money on advertising that sells what is not, strictly speaking, a product or service include political parties, interest groups, religious organizations, and military recruiters. Non-profit organizations are not typical advertising customers, and may rely on free modes of persuasion, such as public service announcements. \nAdvertising spending has increased greatly in recent years. In 2006, spending on advertising has been estimated at $155 billion in the United States and $385 billion worldwide , and the latter to be over $500 billion by 2010.\nWhile advertising can be seen as necessary for economic growth, it is not without social costs. Unsolicited  commercial email and other forms of spam  have become so widespread as to have become a major trouble to users of these services, as well as being a financial burden on internet service providers. Advertising is increasingly invading public spaces, such as schools, which some critics argue is a form of child exploitation .", "id": "high18227.txt"}
