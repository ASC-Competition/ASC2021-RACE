In my own experience, the people I respect the most and think about the most are the teachers who demanded   the most discipline   from their students.\nI miss one teacher in particular that I had in high school. I think she was a good teacher because she was a very strict person. I remember very vividly   a sign over her classroom door. It was a simple sign that said, \"Laboratory--in this room the first five letters of the word was emphasized  , not the last seven.\" In other words, I guess, labor for her was more important than oratory, which means making speeches.\nShe prepared her work very carefully and demanded us to do the same. We got lots of homework from her. Once she had broken her arm, and everybody in the class thought that maybe the homework load would be reduced, but it continued just the same. She checked our work by stamping her name at the bottom of the papers to show that she had read them.\nI think sometimes teachers who demand the most are liked the least. But as time goes by, this discipline really seems to benefit   the students.", "id": "high5770.txt"}
