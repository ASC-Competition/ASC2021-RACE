And he told me it was \"on the fourth floor, next to the pool.\" I found out five minutes later that we didn't even have a fourth floor and there was no pool either! Besides that, I didn't have any trouble with the older kid.\nI think the biggest difference between middle and high school is the homework load  and size of the school. I went from maybe fifteen minutes of homework a night to several hours, so I had to learn how to make full use of time! Our class size is around 550, but joining in clubs, sports, music and other activities at school makes it easier to get to know people in every grade.\nThe best advice I can give about the years you spend in high school is to learn things for yourself, not just to get a good grade. There have been so many tests that I've prepared for the night before, gotten an A, but not remember anything later. I've changed that this year, and I enjoy school so much more. Don't take easy classes just to have a simple year. If you have a choice between chemistry and sports, the first will prove to be a lot more useful!\nWhile drinking and smoking might be present in some middle schools, they are also around in high school. I have a lot of friends who promised they would never drink or smoke, but are now partying every weekend. If you have \"fun\" and spend your nights wasted instead of studying, you will regret it when you are applying for   college. The \"friends\" who say you are a loser for not partying are really not your friends at all. It's hard to see your closest friends grow apart and go in different directions, but don't follow their footsteps. Follow your own path in life and make your own decisions.", "id": "high7728.txt"}
