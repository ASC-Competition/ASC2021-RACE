It can be as easy as walking into a neighborhood store to look at its announcement  board. Local stores often have areas where people can put small signs telling what kind of service they need or can provide. Such services include caring for children or cleaning houses.\n         Or, job searchers can look in the newspaper. Local newspapers have employment announcements placed by companies seeking (looking for ) workers.\n         Another popular tool for finding jobs is the Internet. For example, people in four hundred and fifty cities around the world can use the Craigslist Web site to buy objects, meet people or find a job. Craigslist says that it receives two million new job listings each month.\n         Another useful way to find a job is through a college or university. For example, students at the University of Texas in Austin can go to the Career Exploration Center to get help in finding a job. Of course, looking for a job requires knowing what kind of work you want to do. For example, there is a book called \"What Color is Your Parachute  ?\"by Richard Bolles. This book has been helping people choose a career   since it was first published in nineteen seventy.\n         Some experts also help people find jobs. Susan W. Miller owns a company called California Career Services in Los Angeles. She says her company helps people find jobs by first helping them understand their strengths, goals and interests. Then she provides them with methods and resources  to help them find the right job.", "id": "high22101.txt"}
