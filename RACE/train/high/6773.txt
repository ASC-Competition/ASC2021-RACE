What if this question was to come from an unusual source? In April 2014, the National Health Promotion Foundation uploaded an anti-smoking advertisement onto YouTube. The anti-smoking ad has quickly been known as the \"most powerful anti-smoking ad.\"\nThe anti-smoking video, called the \"Smoking Kid,\" features children walking up to adult smokers asking for a light. The children in the ad are actors but the adults smoking are _ participants in the project.\nThe video begins with the statement \"adults know that smoking is harmful, but don't remind themselves of this fact \" Once a \"smoking kid\" approaches the adults, every adult asked is shocked that a child with a cigarette in hand is asking for a light. The first adult starts by saying, \"I'm not giving it to you,\" and the video goes on to state \"every adult filmed said no and reminded the children that smoking is bad.\"\nBefore going away, the kid hands each adult a booklet after being turned down for a light. The booklet says, \"You worry about me, but why not about yourself?\" Each adult looks around for the child as their faces are filled with confusion and discomfort.\nThe video shows that a few of the smokers quickly threw away their cigarettes or put their cigarettes away, showing that this experiment was affective at that moment.\nThe most influential element in the ad isn't the use of children or the responses from the smoking adults. It comes down to something much simpler than that. Why is it that we worry about other people, forgetting to worry about ourselves?", "id": "high6773.txt"}
