My 11yearold daughter was, in the midst of her project, going to help her older brother in making a little cushion . I left, and in a few hours returned to find a mess in the kitchen, front room, and both children sitting in front of the television.\nHaving had a long day, I was very short with my greeting to them and then I noticed the material my daughter had used. It had been bought to make a baby blanket, and now had chunks cut out of almost every piece of cloth. Not stopping to listen, I  _ at the children and explained how angry I was at what had been done.\nMy daughter listened to me sheepishly, not trying to defend herself at all, but the pain could be seen written across her face. She went back to her room quietly, and spent some time in there alone before she came out to say good night and once again apologize for the mistake she had made.\nA few hours later, as I was preparing to go to bed, there on my bed lay a beautiful, little cushion made out of the forbidden cloth, with the words\"I LOVE MOM\". Alongside it was a note apologizing again, and the innocence in which she had taken the cloth.\nTo this day, I still get tears in my eyes when I think of how I reacted and still feel the pain of my actions. It was I who then sheepishly went to her and apologized for my actions. I display with great pride the cushion on my bed, and use it as a reminder that nothing in this world is greater than a child's love.", "id": "high23485.txt"}
