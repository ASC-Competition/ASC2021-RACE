It might also affect sleep, he says, and that could have an influence.\nThe study was just published in the Archives of General Psychiatry.\nIn December, the journal Social Indicators Research published a study of activities that help lead to happy lives.Sociologists from the University of Maryland found that people who describe themselves as happy spend less time watching television than unhappy people.The study found that happy people are more likely to be socially active, to read, attend community services and to vote.", "id": "high17672.txt"}
