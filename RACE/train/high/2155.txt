That wouldn't be a problem if architect Felipe Campolina had his way.\nThe Brazilian architect has designed a concept for a home tower consisting of portable, stackable   apartment units, which he says opens up new possibilities for ways of living in the city.\nHis design would allow owners to take their home with them when they travel -- whether for a weekend away or for longer periods, he said.\nThe mobile home tower project is at the concept stage, and it could be years before it is built, if ever at all.\nBut if it is realized, it would offer an eco-friendly solution to living in urban areas, Campolina said.\n\"We have enough technology to build with fewer materials and minimize   the impact on nature,\" he said.\nHis vision would call for units with a green roof and walls and a system for recycling water.\nThe tower, whose first floor would be built nine meters above ground, would also make it possible to save space in thickly populated areas.\n\"It is designed to facilitate   its application in dense urban centers, where space is very limited,\" he said.\nStill just a concept, Campolina -- who designed the building for architecture journaleVolo's Skyscraper Competition -- said with enough public interest, it just might become a reality one day.", "id": "high2155.txt"}
