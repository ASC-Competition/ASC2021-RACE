They can actually be quite lazy!  Greyhounds are good at fast races but not long-distance running. They do need regular exercise but they like to run for a short burst and then get back on the bed or a comfortable seat. Another misunderstanding is that greyhounds must be aggressive because they are big in size. In fact greyhounds love people and are gentle with children.\nGreyhounds can live for 12 - 14 years but usually only race for two or three years, and after that they make great pets. They don't need a lot of space, don't make a lot of noise, and don't eat a lot for their size.\nNormally, greyhounds can be as tall as 90 cm. There is, however, a small-sized greyhound, which stands only 33 cm. Greyhounds come in a variety of colors. Grey and yellowish-brown are the most common. Others include black, white, blue, red and brown or a mix of these.\nGreyhounds have smooth body coats, low body fat and are very healthy. Because they're slim they don't have the leg problems like other dogs the same height . But they do feel the cold, especially since they would much rather be at home in bed than walking around outside.", "id": "high9540.txt"}
