Suddenly, we were interrupted clapping.\"Terrific, \" the director said, stepping up the stage from the aisle .\"Except, could you kids face the audience a bit more? \"\nThe kids shifted to face the empty seats, which would be filled in a few days for the church play.\"Perfect,\" the director said. \"Now, Grandma, read to your grandchildren.\"\nhit me. If' only I could read to my real grandchild!\nI had a granddaughter, but I'd never met her. Sixteen years earlier my son was involved in a relationship that ended badly. But out of' it came a blessing: a baby girl named Lena. I hoped to be a grandmother to her-but shortly after the birth, the mother moved without any address left. Over  the years, I asked around town to try and find my son's ex-wife  ,but it seemed that she didn't want to be found.\nI'd just joined this new church a week earlier and was at once offered the part of Grandma in the play. At least now I could pretend to be a grandma. The rehearsals went well, and finally the day of' the show arrived. The performance was great. \"You all looked so natural up there, \"one of' my friends said.\nAfterward, we went to the church basement for refreshments  .I walked over to one of the girls in the play. Rehearsals had been such a whirlwind   that we never really got to talk. \"How's my granddaughter? \" I joked.\n\"Fine !\" she answered. Just then, someone else walked up and asked the girl her name.\nI wasn't sure I heard the girl's answer correctly.

She told me.It was my son.\nShe'd only started going to that church a week before I did. Since that day of 'the play, we've stayed close. Not long ago, she even made me a great grandma.", "id": "high15431.txt"}
