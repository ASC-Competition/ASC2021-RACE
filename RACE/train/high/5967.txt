Students look at your appearance,\" said Kelly Mok, 26, a \"tutor queen\" at King's Glory, one of Hong Kong's largest tutorial establishments.\nRichard Eng from Beacon College, a former secondary school teacher, is often credited with being the first of Hong Kong's \"star tutors\". \"In school all the teachers look the same, there's no excitement,\" he said.\nThe celebrity tutor phenomenon is a result of the huge growth in outofschool tutoring in Asia. It is fuelled by highly pressured examination systems and ambitious parents wanting their children to secure places at top universities and highstatus secondary schools.\nIn societies where success _ good exam results, parental anxiety converts into a \"steady stream of revenue \" for tutoring establishments, according to a study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\nThe tutoring industry, or \"shadow education\" as the ADB calls it, has become very widespread in Asia, fed by the growth in universities and the rising proportion of school leavers aiming for university. Hong Kong University's professor Mark Bray, one of the authors of the ADB study, said a staggering 72% of finalyear school students in Hong Kong now go to private tutors.\nIt's not just Hong Kong. Tutoring has \"spread and intensified  in Asia and become more commercialized,\" said Professor Bray. In South Korea, 90% of primary school children attend such classes.
