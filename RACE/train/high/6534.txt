Some items you might bring back from overseas can be pests and diseases that Australia doesn't have. When you return, declare all food, meat, fruits, plants, seeds, wooden souvenirs, animal or plant materials.\nAustralia has strict quarantine laws and tough on-the-spot fines. Every piece of luggage is now screened or X-rayed. If you fail to declare any quarantine items, or if you make a false declaration, you will get caught. In addition to on-the-spot fines, you could be accused and fined more than $60, 000 and you may risk 10 years in prison. All international mail is also screened.\nSome products may require treatment to make them safe. Items that are restricted because of the risk of pests and diseases will be seized and destroyed by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service(AQIS).\nIn many cases, the goods you declare will be returned to you after inspection. However, any item that presents a quarantine risk will be withheld . You will be given a range of options for each item depending on the quarantine risk:\nTreating the item to make it safe;\nHolding the item until an import permit is presented*; *\nRe-exporting the item;\nDestroying the item.\nThose treatments with the sign \"*\" are subject to fees.\nFurther information:\nFor more detailed information about bringing in food, animals, plants, animal or plant materials, call the AQIS at 1800-020-504.", "id": "high6534.txt"}
