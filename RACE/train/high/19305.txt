It's in a valley so there's not so much wind.It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing.We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get rid of the smog so you can see the sun again.\"\nRoosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a complete solution to Beijing's serious and terrible air pollution.\"This is not the real answer for smog.The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles,\" he says.\nHowever, he hopes the project will make a difference by allowing the city's residents to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air.\"I want to take a park in Beijing, 50m by 50m square, and make it the cleanest park in Beijing,\" he says.He is still discussing with local authorities which park will be used.\nRoosegaarde's studio has worked on several projects that use static electricity  in unusual ways:creating a road that charges electric cars and a floor that generates electricity when danced on.", "id": "high19305.txt"}
