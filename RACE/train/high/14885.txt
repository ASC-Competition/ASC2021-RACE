We lived downstairs and rented the upstairs rooms to the patients at the clinic.\nOne evening as I was fixing supper, there was a knock at the door. I opened it to see a truly awful-looking man. He's hardly taller than my eight-year-old son. \"Good evening. I've come to see if you've a room. I came for a treatment this morning from the eastern shore, and there's no bus till morning.\" He told me he'd been hunting for a room since noon but with no success. \"I guess it's my face...I know it looks terrible, but my doctor says with a few more treatments...\" For a moment I hesitated, but his next words convinced me: \"I could sleep in this chair on the porch. My bus leaves early in the morning.\"\nI told him we would find him a bed. When I had finished the dishes, I talked with him. He told me he fished for a living to support his five children, and his wife, who was hopelessly crippled   from a back injury. He didn't tell it by way of complaint. Next morning, just before he left, as if asking a great favor, he said, \"Could I come back and stay the next time?\" He added, \"Your children made me feel at home.\"\nOn his next trip he arrived a little after seven in the morning. As a gift, he brought a big fish and the largest oysters   I had ever seen. I knew his bus left at 4:00 a.m. and I wondered what time he had to get up in order to do this for us.\nIn the years he came to stay overnight with us and there was never a time that he did not bring us vegetables from his garden. I know our family always will be grateful to have known him; from him we learned how to accept the bad without complaint when facing the misfortune.", "id": "high14885.txt"}
