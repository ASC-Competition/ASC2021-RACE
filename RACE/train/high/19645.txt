However, Warner Bros, maker of the Harry Potter films, wrote to the club's organizer \"Ms Marmite Lover\" warning that the parties would infringe its rights.\nThe club will now hold two \"Genetic Wizard nights\" for Halloween. On her blog,Ms Marmite Lover explains that she researched and developed her menu with her Harry Potter-obsessed teenage daughter and a food writer. \nGuests would have to enter the venue, called the Underground Restaurant, through \"Diagon Alley\" and by giving a password--while a \"Sorting Hat\" would decide the seating plan.\nAfter Warner Bros learned about the event, he wrote to Ms Marmite Lover saying: \"While we are delighted that you are such a fun of the Harry Potter series, unfortunately your proposed use of the Harry  Potter Properties without our permission would amount to an infringement of Wamer's rights.\"\nThe letter added: \"Warner does not, of course, object to you holding a generic wizard/Halloween night at the Underground Restaurant.\"\nMs Marmite Lover suggested in her blog: \"JK Rowling herself, having at one time been a struggling single parent, and having donated to the National Council for one Patent Families, would probably approve of a single mother being entrepreneurial  and creative\".\nThe Underground Restaurant usually charges diners about 20-30 each, except alcohol. Warner Bros says it has guidelines to help Harry Potter fans run non-profit and charitable events true to the spirit of the stories.\nThe vast majority of non-commercial events are able to go ahead with the studio's support, it says.", "id": "high19645.txt"}
