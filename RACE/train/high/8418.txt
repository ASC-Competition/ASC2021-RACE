My grandfather, it seems, had a habit of keeping his loose change in his shirt pocket. As they prayed side by side, during one of the prostrations  , the coins fell down onto the carpet.\nMy grandfather did not notice it. However, a man seated nearby as well as my father noticed the incident. The man reacted fast and picked up the coins and went off into another corner of the mosque.\nMy father took everything in and as soon as my grandfather finished praying, he told him what had happened. My grandfather having heard just about what happened stopped my dad from telling him who took the money.\nThen he went on to tell my dad the following. \"If the man has chosen to steal in the mosque, then it must be because his life is too bad. We must not be quick to judge such people,\" he said.\nSince they owned a grocery shop, my father was told by his father to make sure that every month he should make up a parcel of all the daily necessities required in a household and send it to that person without telling him who sent it.\nWouldn't this world be a better place to live in if we had such wisdom spreading within our society!", "id": "high8418.txt"}
