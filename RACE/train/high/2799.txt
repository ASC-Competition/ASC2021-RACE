The teacher told each child in the class to bring along a plastic bag containing a few potatoes. Each potato will be given a name of a person that the child hates, so the number of potatoes that a child will put in his/her plastic bag will depend on the number of people he/she cannot forgive .\nSo when the day came, every child brought some potatoes with the name of the people he/she hated. Some had 2 potatoes; some 3, while some had up to 5 potatoes.\nThe teacher then told the children to carry the potatoes with them wherever they go (even to the toilet) for one week. With days passing by, the children started to complain because of the unpleasant smell let out by the rotten   potatoes they were carrying.\nThose children who have 5 potatoes really began to feel the weight of the heavier bags. After one week, the children were happy to hear that the teacher had finally ended the game. The teacher asked: \"How did you feel while carrying the potatoes with you for one week?\" The children started complaining of the trouble that they had to carry the heavy and smelly potatoes wherever they go.\nThen the teacher told them the hidden meaning behind the game. The teacher said: \"This is exactly the situation when you carry your hatred for somebody inside your heart. The burden of hatred will pollute your heart and you will end up carrying an unnecessary burden with you wherever you go.\nIf you cannot _ the smell of rotten potatoes for just one week, can you imagine what a burden it would be to have the hatred in your heart for your lifetime?\"", "id": "high2799.txt"}
