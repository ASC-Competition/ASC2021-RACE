She asked Ann if she could keep an eye on the dog. Ann said that she could watch it only for the day.\nTracy took photos of the dog and printed off 400 FOUND fliers , and put them in mailboxes. Meanwhile, Ann went to the dollar store and bought some pet supplies, warning her two sons not to fall in love with the dog. At the time, Ann's son Thomas was 10 years old, and Jack, who was recovering from a heart operation, was 21 years old.\nFour days later Ann was still looking after the dog, whom they had started to call Riley. When she arrived home from work, the dog threw itself against the screen door and barked madly at her. As soon as she opened the door, Riley dashed into the boys' room where Ann found Jack suffering from a heart attack. Riley ran over to Jack, but as soon as Ann bent over to help him the dog went silent.\n\"If it hadn't come to get me, the doctor said Jack would have died,\" Ann reported to a local newspaper. At this point, no one had called to claim the dog, so Ann decided to keep it.\nThe next morning Tracy got a call. A man named Peter recognized his lost dog and called the number on the flier. Tracy started crying, and told him, \"That dog saved my friend's son.\"\nPeter drove to Ann's house to pick up his dog, and saw Thomas and Jack crying in the window. After a few moments Peter said, \"Maybe Odie was supposed to find you, maybe you should keep it.\"", "id": "high9048.txt"}
