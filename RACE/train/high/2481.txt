But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and cannot focus on our schoolwork.\nFor more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that highself-esteem  is the key to success.Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can make people less likeable or more upset when they fail in something.\n\"Forget about self-esteem,\" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, US. \"It's not the important thing.\"\nFeeling good\nCrocker's advice may sound a bit strange. After all, feeling good can be good for you.Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem.\nHowever, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person.\nHe believes that violent people often have the highest self-esteem of all.

Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail in something, try to learn from the experience. \"The besttherapy  is to recognize your faults,\" Vohs says. \"It's OK to say, 'I' m not so good at that,' and then move on.\"", "id": "high2481.txt"}
