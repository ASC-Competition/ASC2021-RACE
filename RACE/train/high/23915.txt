But what happens when kids have a disability preventing them joining in?\n    Challenge Alaska has worked out a national program to give those disabled kids a chance to enjoy the sports they otherwise may not be able to.\n    Alex thought a simple game of bocce ball   was out of reach before. Alex was hit by a car when he was 5 years old, an accident that left him with a broken body and a mind full of dreams. \"Those dreams are harder to do because you can't move your hands, and you can't move your legs,\" he said.     \n    But today Alex was getting the chance to live his biggest dream. With some help, he can get the bocce ball across the playing field and he said he was getting the biggest joy from his favorite. \n    Today, Challenge Alaska worked together with another organization, the US Paralympics Academy  , to give kids with physical disabilities a chance to try some new sports.\n    \"They offer a lot of sports for people with disabilities and that's cool,\" Alex said.     \n    But this program is not just about teaching these kids about sports. \"It's an opportunity to learn how to work on a team, how to work with other people, how to win graciously and how to lose graciously -- all about the lessons you can use throughout life,\" said Jeff Dick, leader of Alaska Paralympics Academy.    \n    Challenge Alaska also has a program called Blaze Sports, which holds different events throughout the year. Dick says skills learned at these free programs increase kids chances of getting college scholarships   to play these sports.", "id": "high23915.txt"}
