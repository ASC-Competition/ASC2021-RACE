Recently the Obama \nadministration is considering disabling cell phones in cars, \naiming to out down cell-phone-related road deaths.\nTransportation Secretaryy Ray LaHood, the nation's anti-distracted-driving supporter, said in an interview on November 18 that federal officials are looking at technology to disable cell phones inside cars.\n\"I think it will be done,\" LaHood said.\"I think the technology is there and 1 think you're going to see the technology become adaptable in automobiles to disable these cell phones.We need to do a lot more if we were going to save lives.\"\nAlso on Thursday, the transportation government started a new \"Faces of Distracted Driving\" video campaign that features people who have been killed or lost their loved ones because of inattentive drivers.The video features heartbreaking stories of children killed in crashes because of phoning or text messaging, and new videos are expected to be added every few weeks.\nA driver is four times more likely to crash while using a mobile phone.More than 5,500 people were killed last year by distracted drivers, and another 500,000 were injured.LaHood has said it is never safe to talk on a cell phone while driving, hands-free or not, because it can really cause distraction.\nIncidentally, a lot of people seem to agree with this viewpoint--a new research shows nearly two-thirds of Americans support a national ban on the use of cell phones while driving, even if the driver is using a hands-free device .But the research didn't ask how people feel about government-issued mobile phone scramblers or other disabling devices.", "id": "high21115.txt"}
