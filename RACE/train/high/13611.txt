I leaned the laptop so she can see where she's going,pleased that our Internet connection in Zimbabwe is holding. \"This is the living room,\" I say. Then I tell mydaughter,s;Show Grandma the bed for the mummy and the daddy. \" From a continent away, Grandma gave herapproval.\nMum had a dollhouse,too.
