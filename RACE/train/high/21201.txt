He had pleased the king in many ways, and so the king believed in him.\nOne day this soldier was on a ship at sea when a great storm came up. The winds drove the ship upon the rocks, and it was broken. The soldier was thrown upon the shore ; and he would have died there if it had not been for the kind care of a farmer who lived nearby.\nWhen the soldier was well enough to go home; he thanked the farmer for what he had done, and promised that he would repay him for his kindness.\nBut he did not mean to keep his promise . He did not tell King Philip about the farmer. He only said that there was a fine farm by the seashore, and that he would like very much to have it for his own.\n\"Who owns the farm now?\" asked Philip.\n\"Only a useless farmer, who has never done anything for his country,\" said the soldier.\n\"Very well, then,\" said Philip \"You have served me for a long time, and you shall have your wish. Go and take the farm for yourself.\"\nAnd so the soldier drove the farmer from his house and home. He took the farm for his own.\nThe poor farmer was hurt seriously. He went  ly  to the king, and told the whole story from beginning to end. King Philip was very angry when he learned that. He sent for the soldier in a great hurry, and when he had come, he had these words burned in his forehead: \"The Ungrateful Man\".", "id": "high21201.txt"}
