When you know the effects of different types of food, you can use your knowledge well and eat what you want to become.\nFood has an impact on our physical and mental health. Have you ever heard any of the following advice?\nLettuce   or milk can make you sleepy.\nTo stop feeling sleepy you should eat peanuts or dried fish.\nEveryone has their own advice to give, which they have read about or have been told by older relatives. Some of these pieces of advice seem to _ each other.\nEating chocolate makes you fat and gives you spots.\nChocolate contains the essential minerals: iron and magnesium  .\nWhat we need to figure out is what type of chocolate to eat to get the benefits and how much of it to eat. We can do this by reading the list of ingredients   on the chocolate bar package. Exactly how much real chocolate is in there? And how much of that do we need to eat to get the benefits of the minerals it contains?\nFuture restaurants might be named after the physical or mental state they hope to create. Their menus will list the benefits of each dish and drink. Some restaurants have already started this concept, and list the nutritional   content of their dishes on the menus.\nLet's take the restaurant \"Winners\" as an example. Their menu would list dishes specifically designed to help you win sports competitions. Or you could choose the Go-faster salad, which is a large bowl of mixed raw vegetables in a light salad dressing, giving you energy without making you gain weight. And what kind of dishes do you think would be on the menu at the \"Clever Cafe\"?\nSo what's going to happen to hamburgers and biscuits? Will the concept of eating food, because it's tasty, go out of fashion? Of course not! Junk food is also changing. If ice-cream is not good for children, can't we give them fat-free, sugar-free tofu ice-cream? Unhealthy food is going out of fashion, so brands are changing. We are told not to drink cola because of the sugar and caffeine content so cola companies are making sugar-free and caffeine-free drinks. We are told dried fruit is a healthier snack than biscuits so some biscuit companies are making biscuits with added vitamins.", "id": "high3036.txt"}
