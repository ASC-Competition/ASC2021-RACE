In either case, the sticker price  of a new car would be less than $ 50. Why haven't you guys kept up?\" \nThe president of GM smiles and says, \"Because the federal government won't let us build cars that crash four times a day.\" \nWhy is that funny (or not funny, as the ease may be)? Human beings love to laugh, and the average adult laughs 17 times a day. Humans love to laugh so much that there are actually industries built around laughter. Jokes, siteoms and comedies are all designed to get us laughing, because laughing feels good. For us it seems so natural, but the funny thing is that humans are the only species that laughs. Laughter is actually a complex response that involves many of the same skills used in solving problems. \nLaughter is a great thing--that's why we've all heard the saying, \"Laughter is the best medicine.\" There is strong evidence that laughter can actually improve health and help fight disease. When we look at laughter--what it is, what happens in our brains when we laugh, what makes us laugh and how it can make us healthier and happier, there's a huge amount about it that no one understands yet.", "id": "high18369.txt"}
