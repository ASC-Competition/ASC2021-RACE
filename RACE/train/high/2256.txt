Then there is the problem of \"work\" during that time. But, as my professor suggested, it's not how hard one works but the quality of the product that's important.\nThat led me to a new idea: the quality of the work.That concept is perhaps best explained by a sign I once saw on the wall in someone s office: \"Don't work harder. Work smarter.\" There is a lot of sense in that idea.\nIf you can't get more time,and few of US can,the only solution is to improve the quality of the work.That means thinking of ways to get more out of the same time than we might otherwise get.That should lead us to an analysis of our work habits.Since \"work\" for students usually means \"homework\", the expression \"work habits' should be read as \"study habits\".\nThen, as a smart student,you will seek to improve those skills that you use in study, chiefly reading and writing. If you learn to read better and write better,there are big advantages that pay off in all your studies.", "id": "high2256.txt"}
