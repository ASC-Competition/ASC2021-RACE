But some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there. They also seem to feel less pain when they are giving all their attention on a car race or other games.\nAt a children's center in Baltimore, Maryland, young kids are finding hospital visits easier to deal with, thanks to a test program called HOPE. Patients in HOPE have a life-threatening condition where their kidneys  no longer get rid of wastes from their blood. To get their blood cleaned, these kids must use the dialysis   machines at the hospital three times a week, for at least three hours each time. HOPE allows kids to play Internet sports, racing, and other games with each other. They will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who have the same problem. \"We want to use the Internet to bring together kids who are ill, and let them know they are not alone,\" said Arun Mathews, the doctor of the program. He loved video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country.\nMany researchers elsewhere are testing video programs that might help young patients. For example, nine-year-old Ben Duskin of San Francisco, California, who was struggling with cancer helped to design a video game where players got rid of cancer cells.\nThat's all great news, because doctors already know that reducing pain and worry helps patients heal  faster.", "id": "high15848.txt"}
