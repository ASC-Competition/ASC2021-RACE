It showed him how to take his changing situation seriously but not take himself so seriously.\nWhen his friends noticed how much better life had become for him, and asked why, Dr.Johnson shared his \"Cheese\" story. Many later said how greatly the story had helped them to keep their sense of humor, to change, and to gain something better, too.\nTwenty years after the story was created, \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" was finally published. It soon became a No.1 international best seller, with one million hardcover copies in print within the first sixteen months and over ten million copies within the next two years.\nSome critics   do not understand why so many people find the book so valuable. They say the story is simple enough for a child to understand, and it insults  their intelligence. Some even fear it suggests that people should mindlessly accept unnecessary changes forced upon them by others, although that is not in the story.\nThe author said that both the fans and the critics are \"right\" in their own way. It is not what is in the story of \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" but how you understand it and apply   it to your own situation that gives it value.\nHopefully the way you understand the story of \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" and the way you put it into action in your life will help you find and enjoy the \"New Cheese\" you deserve  .
