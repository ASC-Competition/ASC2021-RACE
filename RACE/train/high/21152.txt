This name comes from the fact that Vancouver is \nthe third most filmed city in North America behind Los Angeles and New York City.\nVancouver became known as a filming destination because it is a perfect stand-in  for other \ncities. Shot from the right angles, the downtown core could look like New York, Seattle, Boston or a\nvariety of other places. Also, the architectural smorgasbord  that is Vancouver, the low Canadian \ndollar, and generous tax subsidies  attracted film production companies to the city.\nMany would accuse Vancouver of simply being a stand-in city, and not really being of any \nsignificance to the overall culture of film production. However, this has proven not to be the case. The \ncreative establishment in the film sector has realized that Vancouver is more than just a stand-in; it is a\ncity that is filled with talent.\nEarlier this year Pixar Studios opened an animation studio in Vancouver. The animators made famous \nby such hits as Toy Story, Monsters Inc, and Wall-E, demonstrated that Vancouver is now a major player \nin the film industry by opening up shops in the city.\nAmir Nasrabadi, the General Manager for Pixar Canada said the company decided to open an office in \nthe city because of the \"very mature , high-quality talent pool, driven primary by the strength of \nthe industry and great local universities and schools\" \nFor now the studio will work as a satellite branch of Pixar's California studios, but future plans \ninclude the Vancouver studio taking on its own feature films. The British Columbia Film Commissioner, \nSusan Croome, told CTV News in an interview that \"Pixar's announcement is  ly fantastic\". When \nasked if this expansion of Vancouver's film industry was the result of favorable exchange rates, she \nresponded that it wasn't, and the company was making plans for the long term.", "id": "high21152.txt"}
