I asked if she became close to her patients. She said, \"Some I do, especially if I have become their close friends and they tell me things they wouldn't tell anyone else. I've found it harder for the patient's family to accept what's happening. In most cases, the dying person has accepted the truth.\"\nI asked her how she could do this work for so long. She said, \"I have taken care of 3,000people over 37years. I consider dying to be a very important part of life. I feel good because I can make these people's journey easier.\"\nJackie was the mother I have never had. My own mother, Helen, was taken away from me right after I was born. I never knew her. And I had a strange relationship with my father. He was a Sunday father. Since my sister and I lived in foster homes, he came to visit only on Sundays.                                \nBut at the hospice , nurse Jackie gave me hope, love and encouragement.
