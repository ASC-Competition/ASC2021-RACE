People do not know what to do with old televisions or computers, so they throw them in the trash.\nNational Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) state programs director Chaz Miller says the large amount of electronic waste Americans produce is not unexpected.\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates more than 400 million consumer electronic items are dumped each year, and there is a push by more states to ban the waste from landfills  and create recycling programs. They can be torn apart and sorted for useable parts. Mike Fannon who runs the plant in Baltimore, says, \"There are a lot of valuable metals that can be recovered and reused instead of just putting them in the landfill, and in certain components, there are some materials that should not really be in the landfill,\" Fannon explains.\nFannon says nearly 20 percent of electronic waste is recycled nationwide. Thirteen years ago, it was only about 6 percent. Recycling rates continue to rise as more communities have banned electronics from landfills in an effort to keep e-waste poisons like lead  and mercury  out of garbage dumps.\nThis year, several states like Vermont imposed a ban on electronic waste in landfills. More than 25 other states have also adopted landfill bans, e-waste recycling programs or both. Chaz Miller says more can be done to boost electronic waste recycling.\n\"We can do much better,\" noted Miller. \"I think clearly our goal should be to do as well as we do recycling newspapers.\"", "id": "high8572.txt"}
