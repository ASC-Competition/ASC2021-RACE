They believe that traveling can help them expand their field of view, especially in the geographical and historical sense. They also think that touring will give them more chances to enjoy different kinds of food and experience new things that would never be brought by other activities. But those who dislike traveling also have some reasons.\nTraveling, in my opinion, dose more good than harm. Most importantly, it broadened our mind. We can get in touch with othercivilization , culture, customs and ideas.\nThrough history, most people traveled because of necessity --not for pleasure. People traveled just in order to remain alive. They searched for food to eat or places to live in. They sometimes ran away from enemies. This is not to say that no one ever traveled just for the fun of it. In ancient times, for example, rich Romans traveled all the way to Greece to take part in the Olympic Games, and festivals. Of course, some people decided to travel just out of curiosity. They wanted to find out what it looked like beyond the horizon . Also business travel has been going on for centuries. Traders could not only make money but also learn to speak several languages and be introduced to different cultures.\nSo, traveling does enrich our mind and draw new ideas to us. There is no doubt that we can get much from it.", "id": "high886.txt"}
