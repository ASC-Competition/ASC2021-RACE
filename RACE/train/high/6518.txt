For many, goal setting is a never ending circle that starts, stops, and begins again. To help us succeed in reaching our goals, let's examine the reasons why many people fail at reaching them. Here are 7 Reasons That You Won't Reach Your Goals:\n1. You Don't Have Any Goals\nToo many people are afraid to \"set\" their goals. Afraid of failing. Afraid of disappointment. Well, you definitely won't complete them if you don't try. Make a choice and set your goals. Otherwise you will end up wherever life takes you.\n2. You Don't Start\nOK, so you have a goal. What have you done about it? Have you started it yet? What are you waiting for? Procrastination is responsible for the failure of many goals.\n3. You Aren't Willing to \"Buy\" Your Goals\nYes, you have to buy your goals. Why? Because every goal has a price. It has a cost. Time. Money. Sweat. Sacrifice. You will have to \"pay\" for your goals in some manner.\n4. Your Goals Are Unrealistic.\nMake sure that your goals are possible and that you set an adequate time frame for success.\n5. You Won't Stick With It\nOver half of goals will be given up within 30 days. You set your goals .You started them. And then...you gave up. Are you using life's daily happenings as excuses? Goals are not   reached through one effort. Rather, they are made in small steps over time.\n6. You Will Fail...And You Won't Get Back Up!\nNo one succeeds immediately. Those who appear to have effortlessly succeeded have usually put in years of preparation and practice. You have to fall down many times before you will succeed. Skill is learned by doing.\n7. You Quit Before The Finish Line\nToo many people stop...right before the finish line. It's almost like they are afraid of succeeding. Often a life event is used as the reason for not finishing. Something always comes up before you finish.\nAre you reaching your goals? Which of these is keeping you from succeeding? Set your goals. Stay the course. Always get back up when you fail. And make sure you cross the finish line.", "id": "high6518.txt"}
