The RFID Bikealarm is attached to the seat on a bicycle and gives off an alarm when it senses movement.\n\"The RFID Bikealarm is meant to be a useful add-on to mechanical bicycle locks because it greatly extends the range of protection with only a few components,\" Siegel explains on his website. \"It is low-cost, durable and easy to use.\"\nThe Bikealarm was designed as part of Siegel's Bachelor's degree thesis at the University of the Arts Bremen in Germany. The device will scare off any would-be thieves the moment they begin to steal the bicycle to which it is attached. It is able to continuously sense the environment to distinguish between specific events, for instance a passing tram / car and a serious theft.\nSiegel created a working model of an alarm that would sound when it sensed movement, but wasn't initially sure how it would be best attached to a bicycle. \"I decided to mount it to the rails of the seat because it allows for comfortable interaction and the position is less obvious as it looks like a small repair kit,\" he says.\nSiegel chose to use RFID technology rather than Bluetooth to keep the costs down. Siegel explains that the most difficult aspect of creating the alarm was to get the electronic circuit down to a small enough size.\nThe device runs off a kind of battery that can be charged by USB within 2 hours and lasts for a few days with normal use. As the Bikealarm is only at development stage, Siegel hasn't signed any agreements to put it on the market.", "id": "high14760.txt"}
