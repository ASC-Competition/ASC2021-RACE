Your eyesight will be damaged.\" You must have heard such warnings many times. Don't read in dim  light! This is one of the \"pearls of wisdom\" that are supposed to help us live a healthy life.

But the majority of eye experts believe it is unlikely to do any permanent damage.\nWe must drink at least eight glasses of water a day\nIn 1945, the Nutrition Council in US suggested that people need to consume 2.5 litres of water a day. But the water contained in food, particularly fruit and vegetables, as well as in milk, juice and soft drinks, also counts towards the total.\nWe only use 10 percent of our brains.\nThis myth arose as early as 1907.
