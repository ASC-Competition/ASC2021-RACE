There's a lady here my size!\" The mother rushed to her son; then she turned to me to apologize. I smiled and told her, \"It's okay.\" Then talked to the boy, \"Hi, I'm Darry Kramer. How are you?\" He studied me from head to toe, and asked, \"Are you a little mommy?\" \"Yes, I have a son,\" I answered. \"Why are you so little?\" he asked. \"It's the way I was born,\" I said. \"Some people are little. Some are tall. I'm just not going to grow any bigger.\" After I answered his other questions, I shook the boy's hand and left.\nMy life as a little person is filled with stories like that. I enjoy talking to children and explaining why I look different from their parents.\nIt takes only one glance to see my uniqueness. I stand three feet nine inches tall. I was born an achondroplasia dwarf  . Despite this, I did all the things other kids did when I was growing up.\nI didn't realize how short I was until I started school. Some kids joked on me, calling me names. Then I knew. I began to hate the first day of school each year. New students would always stare at me as I struggled to climb the school bus stairs.\nBut I learned to smile and accept the fact that I was going to be noticed my whole life. I decided to make my uniqueness an advantage rather than a disadvantage. What I lacked in height, I made up for in personality.\nI'm 47 now, and the stares have not _ as I've grown older. People are amazed when they see me driving. I try to keep a good attitude. When people are rude, I remind myself, \"Look what else I have--a great family, nice friends.\"\nIt's the children's questions that make my life special. I enjoy answering their questions. My hope is that I will encourage them to accept their peers (a person of the same age, class, position, etc.), whatever size and shape they come in, and treat them with respect.", "id": "high8611.txt"}
