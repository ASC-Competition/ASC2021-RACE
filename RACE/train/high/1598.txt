So, for a long time, I just wrote short articles. One day, inspiration  for an article hit me and, as I started writing, paragraphs began flowing out fast. It turned out to be too long to be an article. I thought it would not hurt to try self-publishing a booklet . The first printing of this 32-page black and white booklet sold out within a week. Here is something that I have learned through my experience.\n1.Start small.\nDon't try to have a 400-page work as your first publication. I suggest you publish a booklet under 50 pages to _ your career as an author.\n2.Ask for advice.\nIf you know some people who have published something, ask them for advice and help. You will gain useful information from them and save yourself many problems.\n3. _ \nWhen you put your heart into something only to hear\"We're not interested\",you may get hurt. But you must remind yourself that this is quite common. Every\"yes\"you receive comes after at least five\"noes\",especially at the beginning. You need to revise your book many times to reduce the chances of being turned down.\n4.The more you market, the more you sell.\nYou can publish an excellent book. But if no people know about it, you cannot expect many buyers. Send out an e-mail to friends, family and business partners, telling them your book's publication date. Ask them to help sell your book.\nDo not be afraid to try novel ideas.", "id": "high1598.txt"}
