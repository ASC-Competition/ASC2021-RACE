Those disabled between the ages of 15 and 59 account for 44 percent, but often their disabilities are not very serious. Although they are more or less able to work, they require vocational training, cultural education and special employment.\nThe disabled over 60 years of age account for 40 percent. Many of them become disabled due to illness or loss of various functions. Some live alone without any income, and therefore their insurance, rehabilitation, and medical needs have become a social issue.\nThe illiterate and semi-illiterate  suffer from limited employment opportunities, and often they become socially disabled as well. These people, often neglected , pose another social problem.", "id": "high16619.txt"}
