Another simple black-and-white image of a Coca-Cola bottle sold for US $35 million. But the all-time record for a Warhol painting is $100 million for a piece titled \"Eight Elvises\". What's amazing is not that the pieces sold for so much, but the fact that they are not what you would call traditional art. They are \"pop art\", art based on simple images of things and people from advertising, movies, music and day-to-day life.\nBorn in the 1920s, Warhol grew up mostly separated from other children due to   health problems. He spent a lot of his time alone drawing and then went on to study art in college. He began his career as a commercial   artist, creating pictures for magazine articles and newspaper ads. That inspired him to experiment with pop art and he hosted America's first pop art exhibition in the 1960s. The show met with a lot of discussion with some people saying that what he was doing was not art.\nWarhol followed his first works with a series we are all familiar with -- paintings of Coca-Cola bottles, Brillo soap pad boxes, and portraits   of famous people. Soon after, Warhol stopped creating his own artwork. Instead, he had assistants and other artists create them at his studio called \"The Factory\". Warhol wanted to show the world that art doesn't have to be complex or original; it can be created by anyone using ordinary things.\nToday, Warhol's work is unmistakable in its uniqueness. No matter how you may feel about his work, one thing cannot be argued. He introduced the world to a whole new art form, inspiring future generations of artists, and eventually becoming one of the most famous and successful pop art artists in the world.", "id": "high14891.txt"}
