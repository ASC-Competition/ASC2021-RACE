The scientists insist that everything should be done to identify those responsible for the crimes and to put them on trial. The Defense Research Society has taken the practical step of offering a reward of PS10,000 for information leading to those responsible, but past experience is not encouraging. People are unlikely to be attracted by such offers. The professional police will similarly be challenged by the problem of finding a needle in a haystack.\nThat is why the intellectual   community in Britain and elsewhere must act more strongly in its own defense. There are several steps that can be taken, of which the chief one is to demand of all the organizations that exist with the declared aims of defending the interests of animals that they should declare clearly where they stand on violence towards people. And it will not be enough for the chairman and chairwoman of these organizations to make placatory   statements on behalf of all their members. These people should also promise that it will be a test of continuing membership in their organizations that members and would-be members should declare that they will take no part in acts of violence against human beings.", "id": "high22346.txt"}
