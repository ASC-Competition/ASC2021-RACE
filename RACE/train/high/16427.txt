What do you know about them?\nThe seahorse is actually not a horse but a fish, and much smaller than any regular horse. In general, a seahorse is about an inch long. It is a beautiful fish that likes warm waters, swims upright  , and looks a little like a chess piece.\nSeahorses are an unusual kind of animal because the males   give birth to babies. Mating   takes place in cooler waters on spring and summer nights with a full moon. The females   put their eggs into the bodies of the males, and the males give birth to baby seahorses.\nThe seahorse can use each eye separately, which allows it to search for food without moving the rest of its body. Seahorses situate themselves near deep, fast-running channels rich in plankton, a kind of life on which they feed. They can catch food from an inch and a half away. Seahorses can change from gray or black to yellow or purple within seconds to fit in with their surroundings, and in this way escape from most of their enemies.\nOne of the surprising facts about seahorses for most people is that they are vertebrates  . They can turn and curl freely, and like to swim in pairs connected by their tails. Their tails are powerful, and they can use them to grasp the surrounding seaweed   to keep themselves from being swept away. So seahorses are usually found in warm water filled with seaweed.\nNow that you know all these facts about seahorses, don't you find them more interesting?", "id": "high16427.txt"}
