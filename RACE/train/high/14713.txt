I can't remember what it was about, but my dad and I had a very big argument   when my mom was away. We both said things we didn't mean, and in the end I said, \"I'm leaving.\" And he said, \"Good. The sooner, the better.\"\nI threw a few things in a suitcase and closed the door angrily behind me, not knowing where I was going. After walking aimlessly for about 20 minutes, I stopped at a local supermarket. Then my phone rang. It was my mom calling. She said, \"Hey, Mary. Where are you? Dad is worried about you.\"\n\"How can he worry about me? I've been away for nearly half an hour, but he didn't call,\" I said with annoyance  . My anger returned and I remembered all the hateful things he'd shouted to me. \"Listen, Mom. You can tell Dad that I'm fine. I'll call you tomorrow,\" I said and hung up.\nI walked around the store, trying to get my thoughts together. By the time I paid for my _ , it had been much later than I used to be out alone.

I miss you and I'm worried about you!\"\nThen a car pulled up beside me. Hanging out of the window was my dad. Beside him, smiling gently, sat my mom. And that's when I started laughing. I laughed so hard that I cried. Despite   my best efforts to run away from home, my father finally managed to track me down. I couldn't leave now, not with him sitting there with caring eyes.", "id": "high14713.txt"}
