Customers here pay only what they can afford, no questions asked.\nA risky business plan, perhaps, but SAME Cafe has done one unchangeable thing in the Mile High City for six years: Open only at midday, the restaurant provides poor local people with healthy, delicious lunches six days a week. Those unable to pay for their meals can instead volunteer as waiters and waitresses, and dishwashers, or look after the buildings and equipment for the cafe.\n\"It's based on trust, and it's working all right\" , says co-owner Brad Birky , who started the cafe in 2006. With his wife Libby. Previously volunteering at soup kitchens, the Birkys were dissatisfied with the often unhealthy meals they served there.\n\"We wanted to offer quality food in a restaurant where everyone felt comfortable ,regardless of their circumstances,\" Birky says. SAME's special lunch menu changes daily and most food materials are natural and grown by local farmers.\nThe cafe now averages 65 to 70 customers (and eight volunteers) a day. And the spirit of generosity behind the project appears to be spreading. In early 2007,one volunteer who had cleared snow for his meals during the long winter said goodbye to the Birkys,\" He said he was going to New Orleans to help with the hurricane cleanup,\" says Birky.", "id": "high399.txt"}
