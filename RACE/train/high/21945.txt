They say they're \"under the weather,\" not feeling good about this time of year.\n         As I stood outside with my two dogs yesterday, it was so cold that my nose and face felt frozen and my ears were stinging.\n         Of course, that doesn't matter to Ricky and Lucy. They have a routine they must go through to find just the fighting spot no matter how cold or hot it is.\n         So I wait.\n         But this time it was different.

Without the extremes, life would be boring.\n         It's being pushed to one of the extremes that makes us appreciate the middle more. Health challenges remind us that we need to pay more attention to how we live. Financial extremes remind us that when things go smoothly it's also time to save for raining days. ks5u\n         I've come to the conclusion that all too often I find a reason not to be happy with where I am at that moment.\n         Whether it's hot or cold, good health or bad, in the money or out of it, I always\nwant it to be different.\n         I'm tired of being \"Under the Weather!\"", "id": "high21945.txt"}
