If you are looking for a cafe with a children' s menu, a play area, lounges for your children to jump on, vast space for your baby carriages, an area for your children to run around, and annoy other customers, while you are unaware of them--then the short answer is 'No, we are not child-friendly.' However, if you would like to bring your children here and they are happy to sit at a table with you and behave properly, please come in. Otherwise, there are plenty of places that are specifically designed to entertain your children.\" The post has since been deleted.\nSome Facebook users called the post \"arrogant  \" and an \"attack on parents,\" The Newcastle Herald reports. The cafe owner responded with this statement: \"I built the cafe myself. It has my blood, sweat and plenty of tears in it.\"\nThe post came about after the cafe owner was asked by a customer, who had left a one-star review on the cafe's business page, about whether the cafe was child-friendly. Ms Kotz told news.com.au she wrote the bad review because she felt staff reacted negatively towards children at the cafe.\nThe cafe owner said it broke a piece of her heart every time when she was watching children emptying salt and pepper shakers into her fireplaces, parents changing nappies   on her lounges, or kids throwing their own food onto her carpet.\nAlthough the cafe's policy has attracted a lot of criticism, most people who commented on the Little French Cafe's Facebook page stood by the owner. One woman named Lesley wrote, \"I don't think there was anything wrong with what you said by any means. If parents want to take their children to your cafe, they need to be responsible for their behavior.\"", "id": "high10716.txt"}
