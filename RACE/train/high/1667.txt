Then try again. Until at last, if you have some gift for it, the failures become less frequent, or at any rate less apparantly.\nIt is this ability to cover up one's defects that is finally regarded as accomplishment or achievement.\nAlong the way there are the discouragements of unkind criticism, outright rejection, troublesome insecurity and irregular inability to meet debts.\nIt is uncommon, therefore, to come across a book containing advice of much practical value for anyone toying  with the dangerous idea of staring on a writing life.\nA friend recently lent me such a book, however - one I wish I'd had the luck to read years ago, and which I would recommend to any young person devoted to making a career of words. It is the autobiography   of the English novelist Anthony Trollope, first published in 1883, the year after his death.\nNeeding some means to support himself, Trollope at age 19 worked as a junior clerk in the British postal service. He was at his desk at 5:30 each morning to write for three hours. And he remained in the mail service 33 years, long after reputation and prosperity had come to him.\nNow, what of his advice in his works?\n1. For safety's sake, arm yourself with some other skills, some other line of work to fall back on .  That way, failure at writing, though the disappointment may appear, will not mean ruin.\n2. Do not depend too much on inspiration. Writing is a craft, which Trollope compared to the craft of shoemaking. The shoemaker who has just turned out one pair of his work sets to work immediately on the next pair.\n3. Have a story to tell, but, more important than that, people with characters who will speak and move as living creatures in the reader's mind. Without memorable characters, story alone is nothing.\n4. Meet your deadlines. Life is endlessly \"painful and troublesome\" for writers who can't finish their work on time.\n5. Do not be carried away by praise. And, above all, do not be injured by criticism.\n6. Understand the risks of writing for a living. \"The career, when successful, is pleasant enough certainly; but when unsuccessful, it is of all careers the most painful.\"", "id": "high1667.txt"}
