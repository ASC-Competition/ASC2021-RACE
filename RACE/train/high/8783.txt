Eating baked fish also appeared to provide a protection against high blood pressure. The study also found that those women who ate more baked fish were likely to have a lower weight,exercise more and eat more fruits and vegetables in comparison to those who ate fried fish.\nResearchers noted that past research had discovered the fatty acids in fish probably decreased the risk of high blood pressure by improving blood pressure along with heart and blood functioning. This study showed the link between eating fish and heart failure risk but it was not designed to show cause and effect.\nThis study also showed that just by eating one dish of fried fish a week led to a 49% greater risk of heart failure,and eating fried fish led to lower fiber intake and higher calorie intake.\nThe American Heart Association suggested eating a minimum of two dishes of fish especially fatty fish each week.", "id": "high8783.txt"}
