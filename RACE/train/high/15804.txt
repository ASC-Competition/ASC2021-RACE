It just means you won't be happy until you are moving towards your true purpose.\nUnfortunately, our school system does very little to help students discover their true career. This is where online personality tests and career tests can help.\nOnline personality tests and career tests can help you better understand what type of work you should be doing to achieve job satisfaction, happiness, and success.\nPersonality tests are most useful in giving you insight into \"how\" your personality compares to others and \"how\" you like to work.\nIn particular, if you frequently experience difficulty working with others, or getting their support and cooperation, a really good personality test would show you how to get along better.\nWhile personality tests are very useful at showing you how you like to work and how you like your work environment, they are not really designed to show you \"what\" type of work is right for you.\nThat is where Career Interest Tests come in. Online Career Tests, such as the CareerPlanner.com offers will help you discover what your true interests are, and what type of work you will be passionate   about.\nBut back to personality tests. The most well-established personality tests are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator R, and the Enneagram.", "id": "high15804.txt"}
