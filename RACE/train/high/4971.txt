As I used these exercises in my classes, I noticed that students were interested. They said more and wrote more. They enjoyed expressing their ideas and sharing them in groups. They were no longer passively _ , but actively taking part in the lesson. I find that creativity can act as a way to increase participation and improve fluency.\nCreativity has become a popular word in recent years. Scholars in arts, psychology, business, education and science are all working to get a deeper understanding of it. Robert J. Stemberg is a creativity specialist and Yale professor of psychology. He defines creativity as \"the ability to produce work that is both new (original) and appropriate(applicable to the situation ) \". This definition is useful, as we want our students to use language in a new way and to use it correctly and properly. Mot scholars say there are two types of creativity: big \"C\" creativity and small \"c\" creativity. Big \"C\" creativity refers to genius level thinking that results in artistic masterpieces and scientific breakthroughs. Small \"c\" creativity refers to everyday level thinking that can be used in any situation our emphasis is on the latter. While it goes without saying that any of our students could go on to be the next Picasso or Edison, our aim is to help students produce more ideas and use language in a new way.", "id": "high4971.txt"}
