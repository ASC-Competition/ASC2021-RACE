When King John, who was the worst king that England ever had, heard of the way in which the abbot lived, he decided to stop it. So he sent for the old man and said, \"Your fault is clear, and unless you can answer me three questions within two weeks, your head shall be cut off, and all your money shall be mine. Firstly, you must tell me just how long I shall live. Secondly, you must tell me how long I shall ride round the whole world, and lastly, you shall tell me what I think.\"\n      The abbot went to Oxford and Cambridge for help but not one of the teachers in the great schools could. At last, sad and sorrowful, he rode towards home. Then he met his shepherd   and told him all that had happened.\n       \"Cheer up, good master. I think I can help you out of your trouble.\"\n       The shepherd dressed himself up with great care and looked just like the abbot. Then he went to the king.\n       \"How long shall I live?\" \"You will live until the day that you die, and not one day longer.\"\n       \"How long shall I ride round the world?\" \"You must rise with the sun, and you must ride with the sun until it rises again the next morning. As soon as you do that, you will find that you have ridden round the world in twenty-four hours.\"\n       \"What do I think?\" \"You think that I am the abbot. But, to tell you the truth, I am only his poor shepherd, and I come to beg your pardon for him and for me.\" \n       The king laughed long. \"Very well then, you have won the old abbot a free pardon from King John for this joke.\"", "id": "high21511.txt"}
