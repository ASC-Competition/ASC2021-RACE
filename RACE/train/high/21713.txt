Then again, some people work very hard for their entire life and only are able to pay their monthly living expenses. As a matter of fact, they usually end up working until the last day they are alive.\nOn the other hand, many people who are well off, so to speak, and through no fault of their own, experience a rapid decline of their standard of living due to an unexpected disaster, poor health and /or a severe economic depression within the country in which they live.\nAdditionally, well-educated people usually earn more money during their active working years and thus are able to save a great deal of money in which to support themselves after they retire from the work force.\nPeople also become wealthy as a result of their own determination or they inherit wealth from elder family members, or they simply continue to work in the business that past generations of their family worked within.\nIt is also true that a person can simply be a lucky dog who wins a lottery or some such contests that give a great deal of wealth to the winner. Let us not forget about the self-made individuals who have a dream of achieving fame and fortune and, after many years truly hard work, are well-rewarded for their continued efforts.\nAn example of whom is the person who wrote the Harry Potter novels. She was just an average person who became a billionaire. So too, Ray Croc, the founder of a chain of fast food restaurants, became rich and famous at a time in life when most people retire from the workforce. Bill Gates is another person, who, by his own determination, skill and hard work, became rich and famous, as well as Ben Franklin and Thomas Edison.\nAs you can see, there are many ways in which to become wealthy and enjoy an above average standard of living. However, those who are motivated by greed and become criminals as a result of such greed end up causing harm to others, as they continue to suck the wealth out of other people within the society. Those criminals simply take all that they get and give back little or nothing in return. What is your plan for achieving financial security, happiness, fame, and fortune?", "id": "high21713.txt"}
