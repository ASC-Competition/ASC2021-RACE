We hope that your visit here will be a pleasant one. Today,I would like to draw your attention to a few of our laws.\nThe first one is about drinking. Now,you may  not buy alcohol   in this country if you are under 18 years of age,nor may your friends buy it for you.\nSecondly,noise. Enjoy yourselves by all means,but please don't make unnecessary noise,particularly at night. We ask you to respect other people who may wish to be quiet.\nThirdly,crossing the road. Be careful!The traffic moves on the left side of the road in this country. Use pedestrian crossings   and do not take any chances when crossing the road.\nMy next point is about litter (throwing away waste material in a public place).It is an offence   to drop litter in the street. When you have something to throw away,please put it in your pocket and take it home,or put it in a litter bin.\nFinally,as regards something,it is against the law to buy cigarettes or tobacco   if you are under 16 years of age.\nI'd like to finish by saying that if you require any sort of help or assistance,you should _ your local police station,who will be pleased to help you.\nNow,are there any questions?", "id": "high1619.txt"}
