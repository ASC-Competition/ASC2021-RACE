I believed that he was just as strong as the giant ape . As he faced death, _ .\nTwo months after he passed away, my sister called to ask if I would like to go see Lisa Williams, a well-known witch . I was familiar with Lisa from her show on Lifetime, and since I was eager to get a sign from my father, I agreed to go.\nI took my father's gold watch and listened as Lisa helped audience members communicate with their loved ones. \"I have a grandfather-like figure with me and he is speaking about his granddaughter Jilly,\" she announced. The audience was quiet; no one raised a hand. I nudged  my sister and whispered to her that this was Dad ,for my third child and my father had a deep bond(,) and he called her Jilly.\nAlthough I sensed his presence, I wasn't confident enough to raise my hand. I needed something a bit more concrete, something undoubted.\n\"This man is letting me know he had cancer,\" she continued. I nudged my sister harder and assured her this was our father. Lisa went on to say that this person died in June (my father had died June 8th). There was swelling of the legs.\n\"Important information,\" she called out. My heart beat fast . I jumped up when she asked, \"Who is holding his watch?\" I waved the watch in the air.\n\"He wishes you congratulations.\" My fourth child was born three weeks after my father died. I was in shock and could not believe I was getting a chance to hear from him, yet I knew our bond was strong enough that he could come to the world. She banged on her chest like an ape and apologized, saying, \"I don't know why but he wants me to do this like Tarzan.\" It didn't resonate  with me until my sister called out \"King Kong!\" I was convinced. No way could this woman have ever known a detail unless Dad was communicating through her.\nEach bit of information she gave us was just as meaningful. She ended our session by informing us that he would send us coins. The very next day I found six coins in various places; they seemed to have come out of nowhere. Even in death he is my Kong, and he remains important in my life.", "id": "high5630.txt"}
