I always encourage such people, but I also explain that there's a big difference between \"being a writer\" and writing. In most cases these people are dreaming of wealth and fame, not the long hours alone as a typewriter. \"You've got to want to write,\" I say to them, \"not want to be a writer.\"\nThe reality is that writing is a lonely, private and poor-paying affair. For every writer kissed by fortune there are thousands more whose wish is never rewarded. When I left a 20-year career in the U.S, Coast Guard to become a freelance writer , I had no hope at all. What I did have was a friend who found me my room in a New York apartment building. It didn't even matter that it was cold and had no bathroom. I immediately bought a used typewriter and felt like a real writer.\nAfter a year or so, however, I still hadn't got a break and began to doubt myself. It was so hard to sell a story that barely made enough to eat. But I knew I wanted to write. I had dreamed about it for years. I wasn't going to be one of those _ ? I would keep putting my dream to the test even though it meant living with uncertainty and fear of failure. This is the shadow land of hope, and anyone with a dream must learn to live there.", "id": "high3750.txt"}
