Each year we host a Walk event, which is a huge success, attracting over 2,000 people from around the Los Angeles area.\nThis year, the Walk has a new look. JNF partnered with the new green plan, GoNeutral. The GoNeutral campaign is focused on removing our carbon footprints from the Earth and contributing to a healthier future for our planet. Funds from the GoNeutral Walk will go towards JNF environmental programs to stop desertification  , promote water reuse, grow crops efficiently in the desert and create green \"lungs\" around cities.\nThis is an exciting and unique opportunity for you to support a very important effort, as well as enjoy a fun day filled with live entertainment, children's activities and much more at the park.\nThank you for your support and I look forward to your commitment to the GoNeutral Walk this year.
