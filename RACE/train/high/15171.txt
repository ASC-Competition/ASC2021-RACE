I went on to say that in my opinion a \"real\" short story was closer to poetry than to a novel.\nHere are some definitions of the short story. My favorite is Benet's: \"something that can be read in an hour and remembered for a lifetime\". One writer said, \"The theme of a novel won't fit into the framework of a short story; It's like trying to squeeze a large painting done on a wall into the frame of a miniature  .  And as in a miniature painting, the details need to be sharp. \"\nThe short story is an example of one aspect of human nature. Often a character _ some event, something that offers him or her change. This is why it's said that short stories usually \"say something \", often a small something, but sometimes delivered with such accuracy that the effect is strongly felt, even a life-moment for some readers, something similar to a religious experience or to witnessing a never-to-be-repeated scene in nature.\nOk, let's form a definition here: A short story is an account, rarely over 10, 000 words or below 500 words-more commonly 1, 500 to 5, 000 words-a single-sitting read, but with enough time and weight to move the reader. It is narrow and focused to produce an effect through the story, most commonly through events affecting some change in an individual.\nWriter Isabelle Allende once wrote: \"Novels are, for me, adding up details, just work, work, work, then you're done. Short stories are more difficult-they have to be perfect, complete in themselves. \"", "id": "high15171.txt"}
