Impressed, the foreman said, \"You can start Monday.\"\nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday went by -- and on Thursday afternoon the foreman approached the young man and said, \"You can pick up your wages on the way out today.\" Shocked, the young man replied, \"I thought you would pay me on Friday.\"\n\"Normally we do,\" said the foreman. \"But we're letting you go today because you've fallen behind. Our daily felling charts show that you've dropped from first place on Monday to the last place today.\"\n\"But I'm quite hardworking,\" the young man disagreed. \"I am the first to arrive and the last to leave and even have worked through my coffee breaks!\"\nThe foreman thought for a minute and then asked \"Have you sharpened your axe?\"\nThe young man replied, \"No, sir. I've been working too hard to take time for that!\"\nOur lives are like that. We sometimes get so busy that we don't take time to \"sharpen\" the axe. In today's world it seems that everyone is busier than ever, but less happy than ever. Why is that? Could it be that we have forgotten how to stay sharp?\nThere's nothing wrong with hard work. But we shouldn't get so busy that we ignore the truly important things in life. We all need time to relax, to think, to learn and to grow. If we don't take time to sharpen the axe, we will become dull and lose our effectiveness.", "id": "high8021.txt"}
