Music was the most important thing in her life, but to tell you the truth, she took lessons for years, practiced every day, but in spite of all this, her voice didn't improve. Honestly, it didn't get better, it just got louder.\nHer teacher finally gave up and stopped the lessons, but Alice refused to quit  , and one day she decided to give a concert and invited her mere   teacher to attend. \nThe teacher was very worried about what to say after the performance.
