A list of important dates for this term is attached to this letter.\nInterviews for our April and September Primary One classes will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday,18th&19th January.Now is the time to apply for admission to Peak School.\nChildren are expected to wear their uniforms this term.As is usual at this time of the year,mornings at the school are quite cold and l would suggest children wear their sweaters to school.As the temperature goes up during the day,children tend to take off their outer clothes,so it is important that all sweatshirts are labeled .\nI have received a few requests from parents asking if their children can wear summer uniforms this term.I am of the view that all children in the school should follow the school policy and be dressed in the appropriate uniforms.In the longer term,a number of US at school have questioned the need to have a winter and summer uniform.Perhaps.with careful consideration,we can develop a uniform that will serve children for the whole academic year.\nAs the foggy mornings start to appear,a number of parents have raised concerns over the safety of those children who walk to school.  Our dark green uniforms are not particularly visible to motorists.Hopefully, the \"Uniform Committee\" to be set up this term will deal with this particular issue.I will keep parents informed of the channels through which views may be expressed in future newsletters.\nWe still have a \"No Hat,No Play\" rule on the playground,so children need to ensure that they have their sunhats in school at all times.\nYours sincerely,\nP D Tunesi\nPrincipal", "id": "high5743.txt"}
