There are,first,Physiological explanations,like more blood flow, and so more oxygen to the brain.Being physically active means there are more hormones produced like endorphins .And endorphins make your stress level lower and  your mood improved, which means you also perform better.\"\nAlso,students involved in organized sports learn rules and how to follow them.This could improve their classroom behavior and help them keep their mind on their work.\nThe study leaves some questions unanswered,however.Ms.Stash says it is not possible to say whether the amount or kind of activity affected the level of academic improvement.This is because of differences among the studies .\nAlso.they were mostly observational studies.An observational study is where researchers do not do controlled comparisons.They only describe what they observe.So they might observe a link that students who are more active often have better grades.But that does not necessarily mean being active was the cause of those higher grades.\nThe researchers said they found only two high - quality studies.They called for more high-\nquality studies to confirm their findings.They also pointed out that \" _ \nStill,the general finding was that physically active kids are more likely to do better in school.Ms.Singh says schools should consider that finding before they cut physical education programs.Her paper on \"Physical Activity and Performance at School\"is published in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine.", "id": "high5930.txt"}
