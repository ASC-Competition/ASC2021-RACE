Every week they met and their conversation usually centered on all the things they were going to achieve. This particular Saturday when they met, WHEN sensed that IF was not in a great mood. WHEN questioned IF, \"What's wrong with you? You don't seem your usual cheery self?\" IF looked at WHEN and replied, \"I just don't feel I am making any progress. Last week I saw a course and wanted to take if only I had the time to take it.\" WHEN knew exactly how IF felt. \"I too saw a course and I am going to register when I get enough money.\" said WHEN, \"What about that new job you were going to apply for? You were so excited about it last week.\" IF responded, \"If my computer didn't break down last week, I would have applied. So I could not type my resume.\"\n\"Don't worry about it.When you are ready another job will come through. I have been thinking about looking for another job too, but I will wait and when the weather gets nicer I will look then.\" WHEN then went on to tell IF about his week, hoping that it would cheer him up a bit. \nThe man at the next table couldn't help overhearing WHEN and IF. \"Excuse me gentlemen,\" the man said. Surprised, IF and WHEN both looked at the man. The man continued, \"I'm sorry, but I couldn't help hearing your conversation. I think I know how you could solve your problems.\" Curious, IF asked the gentleman, \"How do you think you can solve our problems?\" The gentleman smiled and said, \"You only need to listen to yourselves. It reminds me of an old proverb: ' _ '.\" The gentleman went on, \"Just start doing, take action, and stop talking about 'if and when'.\" IF and WHEN suddenly realized that what the gentleman had said was so true. Both of them were guilty of thinking and living their life for the \"ifs and whens\". The gentleman left and their conversation changed. They made up their mind that when they met for lunch next week, there would be no \"ifs and whens\"; they would only talk about what they accomplished! Soon another week came.", "id": "high20871.txt"}
