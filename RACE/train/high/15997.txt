Before we left, we were reminded of the difficulties of driving in Turkey. We certainly did not find this to be the case and, except for a few places in faraway mountainous areas, the roads were wide, and well-paved  . We drove for 12 days along the Western Coast of Turkey and had no problems at all. We found the Turkish drivers very polite and well-educated. We also found that eating lunch in the smaller towns was difficult so we picnicked almost every day.\nThe following day after our arrival was Turkey's Children's Day, started by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Ataturk loved children and he often said, \"Children are a new beginning of tomorrow.\" He even devoted the day 23rd of April to the children which today is celebrated as Children's Day as well as the date when the Republic of Turkey was founded.\nOn that day certain children are picked to take over the places of the government, and a lucky kid will be the president of Turkey for a whole day.\ncan decide what's going to happen and whether or not he is going to have the president next to him. There are a very large number of possibilities of things he can do but some shops aren't open because they are celebrating the day as well.\nAll in all, it was a more enjoyable trip. I would recommend   a trip to Turkey to anyone with an adventurous spirit!", "id": "high15997.txt"}
