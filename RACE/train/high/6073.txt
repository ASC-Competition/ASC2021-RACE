All he knew was that he was on a plane heading for somewhere. The plane landed at  Kennedy International Airport, where he was greeted by a family. This young boy was me.\nI have grown up in a town where there were few Asians, so I stuck out in the crowd. I  made friends quickly and they treated me just like anyone else. You may ask if anyone made  fun of my appearance. Well, of course, I met that' kind of person. I just shrugged it off.\nAs an adopted child, I have something that others don't have. I have had the benefit of two  families. I'm lucky to have got a chance to start a new life. But we must try never to forget our  past. Someday I will go back to Korea to find out what kind of culture I left behind.\nThere is only one thing that I regret about being adopted. When I argue with my parents and they realize they are losing the argument, they sometimes wonder what I would be doing if  I were back in Korea. I don't understand this because I thought the purpose of adopting  someone was to give them a better chance of growing up in a family. Some day when I am  older, I want to adopt a girl and raise her the way my parents have raised me, but I would do it  better, for I know what went well and what did not.", "id": "high6073.txt"}
