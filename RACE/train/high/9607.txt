On the other hand, if you add \"family\" to these three choices given above, there is a chance that 99% of the people are going to put their family first, especially if they happen to be ladies!\nThe main reason is because nature has created a woman to be the cherisher and the nurturer   of the family, while the man is the hunter and protector of his little family. That is the natural rule which has come down through thousands of years. Even if a person happens to be a comparatively worldly-wise person and has no idea of taking on the responsibility of a family, he has a picture of a tight little _ in his subconscious  .\nThey tell a story about a successful millionaire businessman who died and the whole city came to pay its respects. One of his business competitors, met the son and said, \"We are really going to miss your father. You see, I knew your father well.\" And the son replied, \"You happen to be really lucky there, because I never did.\" So, you might be an extremely successful person in your own right upon Wall Street, but if your little child fails to come running out to welcome his daddy at the end of the day to be swung up in his father's arms and held there lovingly and protectively, you come in the \"nothing\" category in the business of life.\nMany people are under the impression that taking on the responsibility of the family is quite tiresome, but they do not know what it takes to be a parent. It is very easy to be a biological father or a biological mother, but the real mother and the real father is that person who stays awake all night when the baby is teething, teaches him right from wrong, is there to hold him when he takes his first steps, and in every way shows that he is there to cherish   and protect the little one from harm.\nThere was a man who did not believe in family, because of an unhappy childhood. But he found a faithful woman to love him unconditionally. The moment he picked up his little baby, he said, \"Well son, welcome to the world! I am here to teach you what your mama has taught me, and we shall both protect you, when you need our help. I will teach you to be a good, just and fair man.\"", "id": "high9607.txt"}
