I remember Margaret Field very well--the girl with that wonderful red hair and those beautiful eyes.  She was the most popular girl in our college. You're a very lucky fellow and I'm sure you'11 be very happy with her.\n    Brenda and I are very lucky,too. Her father gave us this house as a wedding present,so we don't have to pay rent. The house and furniture are insured already,so I can't help you by giving you that kind of business. I wish I'd known earlier that you were in the insurance business. I'd certainly have asked you to give me a policy for the house and its contents. \n    I'm rather doubtful about the value of life insurance. It's my duty,I know,to see that there will be money for my wife,and later on for the children,in the event of my early death. But I feel that it's wiser to put my money into the shares of good business companies. You say I can get a policy that will provide 50,000 when I'm 65. Yes,but that time is nearly forty years away,and what will 50,000 be worth then?The real value of money has been going down and prices go up a little every year,perhaps only 4%or 5%,but the movement is always up,never down. 50,000 in fifty years from now may be worth only two--thirds or even a half of what it is worth today. Now if I put my savings into the shares of the big oil companies,or aircraft manufacturers,the value of the shares will go up with the rise in costs and prices. So the real value of my money would remain about the same,wouldn't it?I know your answer. You'll say that your life insurance policy provides against my possible death. I've got to balance that possibility against the almost certain fall in the value of money*\n    I'd very much like you to meet Brenda. Can you come for a weekend some time?What about next Saturday?If you can manage it,please let me know which train you're coming by,and I'll meet you at the station. We can have a talk about life insurance and perhaps you'll succeed in making me see that life insurance is a good thing. \n                                                             Yours sincerely,\n                                                                   Fred", "id": "high23524.txt"}
