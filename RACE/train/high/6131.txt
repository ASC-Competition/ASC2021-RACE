I had little money and had only been able to afford to stay with my Aunt Rosa in Spain. So, I wasn't really excited as I knew exactly what it was going to be like: lots of noisy cousins , and Aunt Rosa begging me to take her for a ride.\nAfter I had checked in, I made my way slowly to the departure gate. As I was waiting to board the plane, I kept thinking about my ideal holiday destination: Jamaica, with its long, sandy beaches and crystal clear water.\nAs soon as the plane took off, I fell fast asleep and only woke to the sound of the announcement: \"Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten you seat belts, as we will shortly be landing in Kingston.\" I froze in my seat. Was I dreaming? Kingston? Jamaica? I had boarded the wrong plane!\nImmediately after the plane landed, I explained the situation to the authorities. It seems there were also three other passengers heading for Spain. Apparently it had been the airline's fault, since the flight numbers for Spain and Jamaica were exactly the same! Therefore, with no flight back to London for a week, the airline had no choice but to pay for our stay.\nSo there I was, lying on the beach, enjoying the music and the marvelous food of Jamaica! As for Aunt Rosa, I suppose she just had to live without me!", "id": "high6131.txt"}
