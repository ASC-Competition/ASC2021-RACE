Before her the place belonged to Xue Xiaolu, the director of Finding Mr. Right, which hit Chinese screens early this year.\nWith the box office success of So Young, people are once again turning their nostalgic eyes to youth -- an era of passion and pain, of hope and heartbreak. The reason why youth is such a soft spot for many people is that its intangible nature cannot be truly grasped until it is lost.\n\"It is the period between education and employment, between dependence and independence,\"says Zhang Yiwu, professor of Chinese literature at Peking University.\nBut Jiang Chuling, the writer of So Young, says youth shares many similarities with home. When you leave home, you start missing it. \"I think youth is meaningless for young people. Only when you look back does it acquire a special meaning,\" she says.\nFor Zhang Yueran, 31, who is regarded as one of the country's most promising young novelist, \"heroism in youth\" was a cultural asset of people born in the 1970s, but it was swept away by the materialism that is so common in today's world.\nNostalgia for the post-1980s and post-1990s generation, according to Zhang Yiwu, comes from their frustration and anxiety. Born into the most affluent society in 100 years, this generation of single children is not as tough as their predecessors.\n\"They have very high expectations toward life and their disappointment and frustration with reality is huge,\" says Zhang. \"So they turn to the past for comfort, even though they are still young. \"\nSo Young tells a love story set in the 80s and 90s. The idea of reflecting about past time has helped the film win a lot of appreciation. One audience member said, \"I think the story can really bring back memories for a lot of people. It's got something we've all experienced, but can lead us to different feelings. \"\n\"Everyone experiences youth and every generation considers their youth to have been special. But actually, most people's memory of youth is the same--it's a journey from inexperience to knowledge, from thoughtlessness to responsibility. And this journey is often marked by pain--the emotion that leaves the deepest scars within us\", say Jiang.", "id": "high17856.txt"}
