That's something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt - including the beds (though you'll sleep on regular mattresses and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric dried-up lake, which is the world's biggest salt flat. Builders use the salt from the 4,633-square-mile flat to make the bricks, and glue them together with a paste of wet salt that hardens when it dries. When there is big rain, the owners just mix up more salt paste to strengthen the bricks.\nGreen Magic Nature Resort\nWhere: Vythiri, India\nHow much: About $240 a night\nWhy it's cool: Taking a pulley -operated lift 86 feet to your treetop room is just the start of your adventure. As you look out of your open window - there is no glass! - you watch monkey and birds in the rain forest canopy . Later you might test your fear of heights by crossing the handmade rope bridge to the main part of the hotel, or just sit on your bamboo bed and read. You don't even have to come down for breakfast - the hotel will send it up on the pulley-drawn \"elevator\".\nDog Bark Park Inn B&B\nWhere: Cottonwood, Idaho\nHow much: $92 a night\nWhy it's cool: This doghouse isn't just for the family pet. _ is a 30-foot-tall dog with guest rooms in his belly. Climb the wooden stairs beside his hind leg to enter the door in his side. You can relax in the main bedroom, go up a few steps of the loft in Willy's head, or hang out inside his nose. Although you have a full private bathroom in your quarters, there is also a toilet in the 12-foot-tall fire hydrant outside.\nGamirasu Cave Hotel\nWhere: Ayvali, Turkey\nHow much: Between $130 and $475 a night\nWhy it's cool: This is caveman cool! Experience what it was like 5,000 years ago, when people lived in these mountain caves formed by volcanic ash. But your stay will be much more modern. Bathrooms and electricity provide what you expect from a modern hotel, and the white volcanic ash, called tufa, keeps the rooms cool, about 65*F in summer. (Don't worry - there is heat in winter.)", "id": "high5073.txt"}
