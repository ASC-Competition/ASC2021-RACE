He is proposing to attempt the impossible.  So I have to say, \"I'm afraid you can't.  You see.  I'm not on the telephone.  I just haven't got a telephone.\"\n                Why don't you have a telephone? Not because I pretend to be wise or pose as unusual.  There are two chief reasons: because I don't really like the telephone and because I find I can still work and play, eat, breathe and sleep without it.  Why don't I like the telephone? Because I think it is a pest and a time-waster.  It may create unnecessary suspense and anxiety, as when you wait for an expected call that doesn't come; or irritating delay, as when you keep ringing a number that is always engaged.  As for speaking in a public telephone box, which seems to me really horrible.  You would not use it unless you were in a hurry, and because you are in a hurry you will find other people waiting before you.  When you do get into the box, you are half asphyxiated by stale, unventilated air, flavored with cheap face-powder and chain-smoking; and by the time you have begun your conversation your back is chilled by the cold look of somebody who is fidgeting  to take your place.\n                If you have a telephone in your own house, you will admit that it tends to ring when you least want it to ring; when you are asleep, or in the middle of a meal or a conversation, or when you are just going out, or when you are in your bath.  Are you strong-minded enough to ignore it, to say to yourself, \"Ah, well, it will all be the same in a hundred years' time.  You are not.  You think there may be some important news or message for you.  Have you never rushed dripping from the bath, or chewing from the table, or dazed from the bed, only to be told that you are a wrong number?\nSuppose you ignore the telephone when it rings, and suppose that, for once, somebody has an important message for you.  I can assure you that if a message is really important it will reach you sooner or later.  Think of the proverb: \"ill news travels apace.\" I must say good news seems to travel just as fast.  And think of the saying: \"the truth will out.\" It will.", "id": "high18421.txt"}
