The way I see it is if you want to \"Heal Your Life\" then you had better learn how to play \"The Game of Life\" by learning how to \"Slow Down to the Speed of Life\" and keep the \"Four Agreements\",the Solutions may not be easy to do but it is simple.In fact, most solutions are pretty simple,and it is us humans that want to complicate it.", "id": "high23135.txt"}
