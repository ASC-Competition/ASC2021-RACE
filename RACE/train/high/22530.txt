But the way to test a student's knowledge and ability still remains as poor as it was. We have almost done nothing to improve our examination system. \nIt is well known that the examination system we are now using may be a good way of testing a student's memory, but it can tell you nothing about a student's ability. It does no good to students and teachers. \nAs soon as a child begins school, he enters a world of examination that will decide his future of job. \nIn fact a good examination system should train a student to think for himself. But it now does nothing about that. So students are encouraged to member what is taught. It does not enable them to gain more and note knowledge. The students who come out first in the examination often may not be the best in their studies. \nBesides, the examinations often force teachers to train students what to do with the coming examination from time to time. There must be some simpler and better way to test a student' s ability besides knowledge. And that is what we should do at once.", "id": "high22530.txt"}
