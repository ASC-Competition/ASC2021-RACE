But one thing still puzzles old Harold. How is it that he can leave Betty and her friend Joan sitting on the sofa, talking, go out to a ball game, come back three and a half hours later, and they're still sitting on the sofa, talking?\nWhat in the world, Harold wonders, do they have to talk about?\nBetty shrugs . Talk? We're friends.\nResearching this matter called friendship, psychologist Lilian Rubin spent two hundred women and men. No matter what their age, their jobs, their sex, the results were completely clear: women have more friendships than men, and the difference in the content and the quality of those friendships is \"marked and unmistakable\".\nMore than two-thirds of the single men Rubin interviewed could not name a best friend. Those who could were likely to name a woman. Yet three-quarters of the single women had no problem naming a best friend, most trusted person, or the one they would turn to in time of emotional distress . \"Most women,\" says Rubin, \"identified  at least one, usually more, trusted friends to whom they could turn in a troubled moment, and they spoke openly about the importance of these relationships in their lives.\"\n\"In general,\" writes Rubin in her new book, \"women's friendships with each other rest on shared emotions and support, but men's relationships are marked by shared activities. \"For the most part, Rubin says, interactions  between men are emotionally controlled - a good fit with the social requirements of \"manly behavior\".\n\"Even when a man is said to be a best friend,\" Rubin writes, \"the two share little about their innermost feelings. Whereas a woman's closest female friend might be the first to tell her to leave a failing marriage, it wasn't unusual to hear a man say he didn't know his friend's marriage was in serious trouble until he appeared on night asking if he could sleep on the sofa.\"", "id": "high23994.txt"}
