He wrote plays and poems during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, which remain very popular today.\nDuring earlier times, people would probably have learned several ancient Roman and Greek plays. It was not unusual for writers to produce more current versions of these works. For example, in Shakespeare's play \"The Comedy of Errors\"(<<>> )Shakespeare borrowed certain details from the ancient Roman writer Plautus. For his play \"Macbeth\"(<<>> ), Shakespeare most likely used a work on Scottish history by Raphael Holinshed for information. Shakespeare might have borrowed from other writers, but the intensity of his imagination and language made the plays his own. While many plays by other writers of his time have been forgotten, Shakespeare and his art live on.\nShakespeare was also influenced by the world around him. He described the sights and sounds of London in his plays. His works include observations about political struggles, the fear of diseases, and the popular language of the city's tradesmen. Shakespeare's knowledge of the English countryside is also clear. His works include descriptions of deep forests, local flowers, and the ancient popular traditions of rural people.\nIt would be impossible to list all of the ways in which Shakespeare's works have influenced the world culture. But the first and greatest example would be his great influence on the English language. During his time, the English language was changing. Many new words from other languages were being added. Shakespeare used his sharp mind and poetic inventiveness to create hundreds of new words and rework old ones. For example, he created the noun forms of \"critic\", \"mountaineer\" and \"eyeball\". Many common expressions in English come from his plays, including \"pomp and circumstance \"from \"Othello\"(<<>> ), \"full circle \" from \"King Lear\"(<<>> ), etc. The list of cultural creations influenced by Shakespeare is almost endless. From paintings to television to music and dance, Shakespeare was well represented. Shakespeare's plays have been translated into every major language in the world.\nShakespeare became a well-known writer during a golden age of theater. His years of hard work paid off.", "id": "high15097.txt"}
