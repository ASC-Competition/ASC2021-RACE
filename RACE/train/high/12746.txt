These web-based forums for discussing ideas, experiences or opinions allow students to discuss publicly what they are studying with other students and experts outside their own university. \"I really encourage them to put their personal opinion in there, provided they are informed and backed up with evidence.\" Bartlett-Bragg says because a lot of academics in her field of electronic or e-learning now have their own blogs, students can engage directly with them.\nShe says one of the most powerful facilities in weblogs is pinging, which involves a person positing a comment about someone else's work on their own blog. They use the \"Trackback\" tool to notify the author when they have published the comment, basically inviting them to discuss it.\n\"They get such a buzz when they make a comment on another person outside the boundaries of the institution and that person responds, or even gives them some further reading.\" she says. \"They are getting new perspectives that I can't give them in a normal lecture.\"", "id": "high12746.txt"}
