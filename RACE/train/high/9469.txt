Batches of such data may be sold for a few dollars.\nThe Wall Street Journal survey discovered that spying on Internet users is one of the fastest-growing businesses on the World Wide Web.\nThe \"cookie\" a tiny text file put on your PC by websites or marketing firms which might be used to remember your. preferences for one site, or to track you across many sites is already old news.

Private, sensitive, personal and business information is being gathered and sold without their knowledge.\nCompanies insist the information they gather is anonymous and the data is used harmlessly. But the technology has grown so powerful that even some of the biggest websites in the US don't know that they were installing intrusive files on visitors' computers. These include MSN. com and Yahoo. com.\nNext time you visit a webpage and find an ad banner advertising something you've been planning to buy, don't be amazed that your computer can read your mind.", "id": "high9469.txt"}
