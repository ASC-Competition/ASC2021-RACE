It may sound impossible, but it's actually happened.\nThe phenomenon of being able to suddenly speak another language is known as\"Xenoglossia\", from the Greek words\"xenos\"(foreigner)and \"glossa\"(language).\n _ once happened to a 13yearold girl from Croatia. After being unconscious because of a disease for 24 hours in 2010,she woke up speaking fluent German. The girl, who came from the town of Knin in the south of Croatia,was studying German at school but she'd only started recently. Her parents said that she'd been reading German books and watching German TV at home, but that she wasn't fluent in the language.However ,since waking up, she's been able to communicate \"perfectly\"in German.What's really strange is that she's now unable to speak Croat,her mother language.Doctors at Split's KB Hospital have asked some experts to examine the girl as they try to find out what caused the change.Dr Mijo Milas said,\"In earlier times this would have been considered as a miracle ;we prefer to think that there must be an explanation--it's just that we haven't found it yet.\"\nIn 2007,Matej Kus from Czech became unconscious after a motorbike accident. On waking up 45 minutes later,he could speak fluent English.Matej was only 18 years old at the time, and had just started studying the language and so was at a low level.Peter Waite,Kus's teammate said,\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing.It was really clear English.It was unbelievable to hear him talk in unbroken English.\"Unluckily,Matej's new language skills didn't last.Two days later, when he recovered fully from the accident, he'd completely forgotten his English.\nWe still don't know exactly what happened to the two people. Perhaps scientists will discover something new and exciting. But until then, keep studying!", "id": "high5326.txt"}
