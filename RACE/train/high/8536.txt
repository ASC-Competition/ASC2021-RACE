One of the pots had a crack  in it, so while the other pot always delivered   a full pot of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to his house, the cracked pot arrived only half full. This went on every day for years.\nOne day a neighbor asked the man, \"One of your pots has been broken for years. It can only deliver half its load, so you don't get full value from your efforts. Why don't you buy a new one?\"\nThe man smiled and said, \"Please follow me to my house, and you may see some beautiful flowers.\" On the way to the man's house, the neighbor took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path.\nThe man said to the neighbor, \"Did you notice that there were flowers only on one side of the path, but not on the other side? That's because I have always known about the flaw   of my pot. I planted flower seeds on one side of the path. Every day when I walk back from the stream, the broken pot waters them. For years, I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate   my house. Without the broken pot, I would not have this beauty.\"", "id": "high8536.txt"}
