Some of the earliest board games are over 5,000 years old. The oldest is probably Senet, an American Egyptian game which has been found in burials from before 3000 BC. The game involves an element of luck, and so it was thought by the Ancient Egyptians that those who won the game were protected by God. For this reason, games of Senet were often buried alongside the dead body, to be used on the dangerous game board is set out as a grid of three by ten rows, and uses two sets of at least five pawns. The actual rules are unknown, although some historians have proposed rules which were used in the Senet sets available today.\nThe Royal Game of Ur, also known as the Game of Twenty Squares, is another ancient game which dates back to the First Dynasty of Ur, in 2600 BC Mesopotamia. It was played with two sets of seven counters, one black and one white, and three four-sided dice  . Although the ancient rules are unknown, a stone tablet has been found which describes a reliable record of how the game was played in 177-176 BC.\nBoth Senet and The Royal Game of Ur probably came into existence long before the game backgammon  ,which itself has a long history. The game of Nard, which existed in Iran in around 3000 BC, used two sets of fifteen counters, four dice and same board as the one used in backgammon today, although the initial starting positions and rules are different. Similar games were played in Ancient Rome and India.", "id": "high18921.txt"}
