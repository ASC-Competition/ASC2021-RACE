More than 2.6 billion people lack basic sanitation  .\nThe combination proves deadly. Each year, diseases related to inadequate water and sanitation kill between 2 and 5 million people and cause an estimated 80 percent of all sicknesses in the developing world. Safe drinking water is a precondition for health and the fight against child death rate, inequality between men and women, and poverty.\nConsider these facts:\n* The average distance that women in Africa and Asia walk to collect water is 6 kilometres.\n* Only 58 percent of children in sub-Sharan Africa are drinking safe water, and only 37 percent of children in South Asia have access to even a basic toilet.\n* Each year in India alone, 73 million working days are lost to water-borne diseases.\nHere are three ways you can help:\n1) Write Congress\nCurrent U.S. foreign aid for drinking water and sanitation budgets only one dollar per year per American citizen. Few members of Congress have ever received a letter from voters about clean drinking water abroad.\n2) Sponsor a project with a faith-based organization\nMany U.S. religious groups already sponsor water and sanitation projects, working with partner organizations can make safe water a reality for thousands of people.\n3) Support nonprofit water organizations\nNumerous U.S. based nonprofits work skillfully abroad in community led projects related to drinking water and sanitation. Like the sample of non-profits noted as follows, some organizations are large, others small-scale, some operate world-wide, others are devoted to certain areas in Africa, Asia, Latin America.
