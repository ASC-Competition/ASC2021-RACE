Mike insisted they were not rivals . \"No. It's two teenagers going out there, living their dream and having the adventure of a lifetime,\" he said.\nMike may be young, but he is no stranger to sailing adventures. He picked up the hobby at the age of 6 when his father took him out in a small boat on a local lake. Father and son sailed separate boats across the Atlantic when Mike was 14, making him the youngest person to cross that ocean solo. That record gave him the taste for this even greater challenge.\nOn the recent journey, the scariest moment for Mike came when his sailboat was hit by storms in the southern Indian Ocean.\n\"We were picked up by what felt like a 60-foot wave and threw down on our side at 90 degrees,\" he said.\n\"It felt like I was going right over. Stuff was flying around and I just thought 'Oh no'.\"\nAt other times, he had to dive into the Pacific and fix problems. He tied himself to the boat, jumped into the water and went to work with a knife in 30-second dives underneath the boat to cut a rope away.\nMike said he felt proud that he made his dream come true. \"You've got to have confidence in yourself that you will make it,\" he said.", "id": "high12175.txt"}
