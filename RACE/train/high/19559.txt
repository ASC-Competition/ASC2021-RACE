It pulls both the front brake and the back brake at the same time.\nLauren Turner was able to ride her bike, but not as confidently and quickly as her friends.\n\"She couldn't use the front brake. She was only using the back brake, but the front brake makes you stop twice as fast,\" says Micha Wallace, who with Katie Bell, Anina Sakaguchi and Andrew Morris won second prize in the James Dyson Awards for their single-handed bike braking lever.\n\"She used it all last summer and she had no problems. She said it helped her go faster because she felt more confident in her braking abilities. She felt safer.\" says Wallace.\nThe invention was the fourth-year design project for the four students. They designed, tested and created a prototype  within a four-month period.\nWhen Wallace heard about the James Dyson Awards on the news, she and her co-inventors entered their project in the UK-based contest. The contest mainly rewards student designers who create products that improve the way we live. The Guelph students collected the second prize -PS2,000 for them, plus PS500 for their school.\nAs well, they had a chance to meet James Dyson, a UK inventor. While praising the students for their creativity, Dyson said the single-handed lever could improve safety for all cyclists. \"By using both brakes at once,\" he explains, \"you could prevent the possibility of flying over the handlebars and ending up with an injury.\"\nThe students are hoping to sell the patent to a major company. It may be used in other devices that require two hands for operation.", "id": "high19559.txt"}
