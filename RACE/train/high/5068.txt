This is not a trend they can afford to follow; perhaps this fashion is only for the rich.\nMost consumers today do not cause huge carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.Their responsibility lies not in choosing a low-carbon lifestyle today, but in avoiding a high-carbon life in the future.The principle of \"common but differentiated responsibility\" - a basis of sustainable development - can be applied here as well.\nIn China, low-carbon living still is resisted by a lack of social infrastructure . Even if your salary allows you to make that choice, nobody is there to help you accomplish it.\nConsider energy-saving homes. You need to find out whether or not the developer has used natural materials wherever possible; how effective the insulation(, ) is; and what the green credentials of installed equipment are.You can read up a little, but you'll still be lucky to avoid being puzzled by the developers' marketing.Many so-called energy-saving buildings are nothing of the sort, and some are even more energy-hungry than the average home - as Li Taige warned in his article \"Energy-efficient buildings? Not always\", on China Dialogue last August.", "id": "high5068.txt"}
