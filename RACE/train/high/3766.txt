In the US, where everyone drives, the main step to the freedom of adult life is learning to drive. At 16, American teens take their driving test. When they have their license, they drive into the grown-up world.\n\"Nobody wants to ride the cheese bus to school,\" said Eleanor Fulham, 17. She brought the pressure back to memory, especially from kids from wealthier families. \"It's like you're not cool if you don't have a car,\" she said.\nAccording to recent research, 41% of 16 to 19-year-olds in the US own cars, up from 23% in 1985. Although, most of these cars are bought by parents, some teens get part-time jobs to help pay.\nNot all families can afford cars for their children. In cities with subways and limited parking, some teenagers don't want them. But in rich suburban areas without subways, and where bicycles are more for fun than transportation, it is strange for a teenager not to have a car.\nBut police say 16-year-olds have almost three times more accidents than 18 and 19-year-olds. This has made many parents pause before letting their kids drive.\nJulie Sussman, of Virginia, decided that her son Chad, 15, will wait until he is 17 to apply for his learner's permit.\nChad said he has accepted his parents' decision, although it has caused some teasing from his friends. \"They say that I am unlucky,\" he said, \"But I'd rather be alive than driving, and I don't really trust my friends on the road, either.\"\nIn China, as more families get cars, more 18-year-olds learn to drive. Will this become a big step to becoming an adult?", "id": "high3766.txt"}
