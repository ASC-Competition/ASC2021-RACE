I suddenly thought we didn't need any of the junk, and we abandoned all of those, saving $300.\nThat got me thinking about all our pointless expenses in life. With a promise that we'd stop if it was killing us, I convinced the family to take the leap into frugality . The rules were that we would buy nothing for 30 days except absolutely essentials.\nOur adventure began with a great start. By 9 a.m., my wife, Ruth, had already made cakes from old strawberries and picked flowers I didn't even know we had in the garden. I cleared the car by hand for the first time for years. I read and returned the neighbor's newspaper before he woke up. Total spending on the first day: $0.\nAs days turned into weeks, we became so proficient  at living frugally. We started riding our bikes to save gas. My child's finger painting was recycled as gift wrap for the homemade presents. We started to use an Internet application like Skype for free phone calls and ask neighbors with gardens for extra vegetables and herbs.\nIn the end, we saved more than $2000 by not spending for a month. When we began, I imagined we would rush out the moment we were done and buy a lot of things in the supermarket, then maybe hit the mall or go to the movies.", "id": "high14761.txt"}
