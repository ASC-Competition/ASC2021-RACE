It came from the great river itself.It was part of one of the cries used by men who worked in the ships.When a man called \"By the mark twain!\" he meant that the river was \"two marks deep\" there,that is to say,six feet deep ( \"Twain\" is an old form of the word \"Two\".) Samuel Clemens often heard these words when he was young,and he used them as a pen name all his life.\nDuring his work on the Mississippi he met travelers of all kinds,and this helped him a great deal when he started to write.But the number of travelers became smaller when war started in America in 1861.Many of the great ships on the river stopped work.Samuel left then and went to Nevada with his brother,who was at that time Governor of Nevada.There,near the town of Carson,Samuel became a gold miner,but he never made much money at the time.He soon saw that life in the gold mines was not for him.He also tried writing for the newspapers in Nevada,and this seemed more hopeful.He found that he could write.\nHe went to Europe in 1867 and visited France and Italy.In 1870 he married Olivia Langdon,and two years later he was spending nearly all his time writing.Among his books is his own story (1908).\nHe is now always known as Mark Twain,and many people do not even know that his family name was Clemens.He traveled in America and in England,and went to Oxford in 1907.He was one of the great American writers of the time,and could make his readers laugh--a thing which few writers can do.He died in 1910.", "id": "high20328.txt"}
