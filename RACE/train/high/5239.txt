For a nominal annual membership fee of PS60, users are free to enter the shop once a month and help themselves to no less than PS250 worth of goods every year. The only 'catch' is that shoppers are asked to complete a simple questionnaire about each product they try.\nKnown as 'try-vertising', the concept allows manufacturers to test products and receive consumer feedback before launching onto the open market. It is already very popular in Japan and now looks set to transform the fortunes of the embattled  UK retail industry. According to new figures, stores are facing a Christmas crisis with the weakest High Street trading for six months.\nMichael Ghosh, the brainchild behind Sample Trend, said: \"The concept behind Sample Trend is unique in the UK. It allows shoppers the opportunity to walk away with a number of real, full-size products of their choosing without handing over a penny.\"\nThe concept of in-store try-vertising is simple but effective. Businesses across all sectors, from cosmetic manufacturers to beverage  makers, place new products on the shelves at Sample Trend and wait for consumers to try them out.\nCustomers complete a short 10-point questionnaire about the product, and the feedback they provide is used to make any last-minute improvement before the product is brought officially to market. The Sample Trend store stocks everything from cosmetics, food and drink, and household goods.\nGhosh, the former advertising and sales director for Disney Europe, said such feedback may also build brand loyalty from the outset---a particularly appealing prospect for new businesses.", "id": "high5239.txt"}
