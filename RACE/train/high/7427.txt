Regular X-rays can show a lot. CAT scans can show even more. They can give three-dimensional  view of body organs .\nWhat is a CAT scan? CAT stands for Computerized Axial Tomography(X). It is a special X-ray machine that gets a 360 - degree picture of a small area of a patient's body.\nDoctors use X-rays to study and examine diseases and injuries within the body. X-rays can find foreign objects inside the body or to take pictures of some organs inside if special things as dyes or special liquids are added to the organs to be X-rayed.\nA CAT scanner, however, uses a beam  of X-rays to give a cross-sectional view of a particular part of the body. A fine beam of X-rays is scanned across the body and circled around the patient from many different angles . A computer analyzes  the information from each angle and produces a clear cross-sectional picture on the screen. This picture is then photographed for later use. Several cross-sections, taken one after another, can give a clear \"photo\" of the entire body or of any body organs. The newest CAT scanners can even give a clear picture of active, moving organs just as a fast-action camera can \"stop the action\" giving clear pictures of what appear only mistily  to the eye. And because of the 360 - degree pictures, CAT scans show 3-dimensional views of organs in a manner that was once only seen during surgery or autopsy (examining a dead body).", "id": "high7427.txt"}
