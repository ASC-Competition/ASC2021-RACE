While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes Coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other.\n\"Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal.\"Hannah protested. The light changed and they drove on, but Hannah was too young to be reasonable. She pestered  her parents about _ insisting that she wanted to do something.\n\"What do you want to do?\" her mom responded. \"Sell our house?\"\nWarning! _ . Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home.\nEventually, that's what the family did. The project --crazy, impetuous   and utterly inspiring -- is written down in detail in a book by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month: \"The Power of Half.\" It's a book that, frankly, I'd be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street.\nAt a time of enormous needs in Haiti and elsewhere, when so many Americans are trying to help Haitians by sending everything from text messages to shoes, the Salwens offer an example of a family that came together to make a difference -- for themselves as much as the people they were trying to help. In a column a week ago, it described neurological evidence from brain scans that unselfishness lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primary satisfaction. The Salwens' experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness.\nMr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house.", "id": "high5926.txt"}
