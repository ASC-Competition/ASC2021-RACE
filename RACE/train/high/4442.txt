Britain, or Great Britain, is the larger of these two islands and it is divided into three parts: Scotland, Wales and England.\nThe United Kingdom (UK) is short for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is made up of Scotland, Wales, and England (i.e. the whole of Britain), and also about one-sixth of Ireland, the Northern part. The rest of Ireland is self-governing .\nEngland is the largest, most populous  , and generally speaking, the richest section. English people often use the words \"England\" and \"English\" when they mean \"Britain\" and \"British\". This sometimes makes the Scots and the Welsh angry. The Scots are very proud of their separate nationality. The Welsh too do not consider themselves as England, and have a culture and even a language of their own. Ireland became part of the United Kingdom in 1801, but is soon grew discontented  , and for forty years the \"Irish Question\" was the greatest headache of British Parliament . At last, Ireland divided itself into two: Northern Ireland remained loyal  to the Crown , and in 1922 the rest of the country broke away to form Irish Free State, now the Republic of Ireland.", "id": "high4442.txt"}
