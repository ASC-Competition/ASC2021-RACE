According to several leading educational experts, this is one of the biggest mistakes that some parents make. Generally, the child will understand very well what the parents expect, and will fall. Unrealistic expectations of the parents can cause great damage to children.\nHowever, if parents are realistic about what they expect their children to do, and are hopeful in a sensible  way, the child may succeed -especially if the parents are very supportive to their children.\nMichael Li is very lucky. He is very fond of music and his parents help him a lot by taking him to concerts and let him attend piano and violin lessons. Although his father is a good musician, he never makes Michael enter music competitions if he is unwilling to.\nMichael's friend, Winston Chen, however, is not so lucky. Both his parents are successful musicians, and they set too high a goal for Winston. They want their son to be as successful as they are and so they enter him for every piano competition held. They are very unhappy when he does not win. \"When I was your age, I used to win every competition I entered.\" Winston's father tells him. Winston is always afraid that he will disappoint his parents and now he is always quiet and unhappy.", "id": "high354.txt"}
