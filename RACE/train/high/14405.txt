Basically, it's an organization which uses professional   footballers to help fight racism in sport and society. A few weeks later, he asked me if I wanted to do a bit more for them. I thought he probably meant for me to give money or do some voluntary work. But then he told me that a group of about 20 people were getting sponsored   to play the highest ever game of rugby   at 5,140 meters on Mount Everest.\nDay 4\nWe're making our way up to the base camp -- that's where most climbers start their final climb to the top -- and then, we'll play our game. Today we started out at 8 am. We had to cross three suspension bridges  . One of them was so high that you couldn't see the bottom. Then we walked through some beautiful forest areas before we started a two-hour uphill hike to Namche Bazaar.\nDay 10\nBase camp is basically just a lot of stones and tents. The walk up was really exhausting. Maybe if I was fitter, I wouldn't find this so hard, but then it was not just me -- all of us got very short of breath.\nDay 11\nToday we played our game. It was supposed to be a \"friendly\" game, and last night, we had agreed we'd just walk and not run. However, it was a really heated game and two players were even sent off. We only played for 14 minutes. I think someone would have got hurt if we'd played any longer! My team won and I scored the last try! Of course, none of this matters. What's really important is that we did it and we've raised a load of money.", "id": "high14405.txt"}
