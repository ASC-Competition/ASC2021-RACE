We didn't start skydiving but we are Ohio's oldest skydiving school which opened in 1961!\nTandem Skydiving\nTandem skydiving is required if this is your first time skydiving. After filling out paperwork and watching a short video, you will be ready to make your skydive. Somewhere around 11,500 feet you will be secured to your tandem instructor. The door will open and you exit the plane.\nYour freefall with your instructor will last for approximately 40-50 seconds. We can almost guarantee this will be the most exciting minute of your life as you reach the speed of around 120 mph, falling for about two miles back to the earth!\nDon't forget to have a video taken of your skydive to show all those that didn't think you would jump from an airplane!\nStatic Line Courses\nOnce you have made your tandem skydiving, you can move on to our Static Line Program. The Static Line Jump is the traditional way to learn to skydive. We have classes throughout the year. Every student will be led through the entire day by a licensed instructor. Never does the student feel unattended.\nOnce training is over, students will make their first jump on that very same day! If the weather does not cooperate, you can come back the next day, or we will re-schedule a time to make your skydive.\nPrice\n$165.00 Tandem skydiving only\n$175.00 Static Line Course only\nInvite one of our professional videographers on your skydive:\n$125.00 DVD with photos\nBooking\nTo book your tandem skydive or skydiving course, call us at (937) 372-0700.
