I really ought to have written to you---it was my turn, I know----but I have been terribly busy. The children seem to take up all my time. I am thinking of sending Ann to a nursery school. She'll be four next month. Baby has just started to walk and doesn't give me a moment's peace. But you know what it is like! How are all your children? I'm sure they love living in the country.\nI'm afraid we can't come over to see you next Sunday, as you suggest. Tom's mother is coming to spend the day with us. What about the Sunday after that----- the twenty-second? We are free that day and should love to come. We're longing to see your house.\nLet me know, then, if the Sunday after next suits you. May we come for lunch? We'd like to leave fairly early in the evening to avoid the heavy traffic on the roads.\nLove from us all,\nEdna", "id": "high11779.txt"}
