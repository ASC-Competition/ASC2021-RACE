In recent years, however, the character has been criticized as an ill image of Asian-Americans.\nYunte Huang, an English professor at the University of California, says that's not the case. He has been exploring the character and real-life policeman who inspired him.\nCharlie Chan has been a familiar character to readers and film-goers, beginning in the 1920s. The detective solved crimes around the world in more than 40 films through the 1940s, and with the invention of television, found a new audience in the 1950s and 1960s.\nHuang discovered Charlie Chan through books by American author Earl Derr Biggers, who created the character.\n\"One day, I happened to find two Charlie Chan novels. At that point I thought I knew that he was a negative character against Asians, but when I read the book,\" he says, \"I was immediately attracted. Ever since then, I've been a fan of Charlie Chan.\"\nAs a fan of the books and films, Huang was surprised to learn that Charlie Chan was based on a real detective named Chang Apana, who was born to Chinese parents in Hawaii around 1871. Apana worked as a cowboy, and joined the Honolulu police force in 1898.\n\"He almost immediately became a local legend because as a former cowboy,\" says Huang, \"he would walk the most dangerous areas in Chinatown carrying a bullwhip instead of a gun. He didn't need that.\"\nAlthough some say the image of Charlie Chan, with his broken English, is embarrassing for Asian-Americans, Huang believes Chan's broken English and unusual ancient sayings were part of his charm .\n\"Let me just quote a few - 'Actions speak louder than French,' or 'Mind like parachute  . Only function when open.' Charlie Chan always owes these instructive sayings to Confucius' eastern wisdom.\nFor Huang, the fictional Charlie Chan is highly entertaining, while the real-life policeman, Chang Apana, is a Chinese-American success, whose story is worth telling.", "id": "high959.txt"}
