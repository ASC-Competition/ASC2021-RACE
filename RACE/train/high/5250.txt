Before you go there, it is good to learn some of the basic Iceland customs first.\nJust like other countries in Europe, it is one of the customs in Iceland to shake hands and say \"Hello\". Kissing each other's cheeks is acceptable along with wishing each other a happy day.\nAnother custom is to take off your shoes in the hallway  when you enter someone's home. Also, don't be surprised if someone invites you to their house, since Icelanders love to have guests. Just make sure you take flowers or a similar token of thanks to give them.\nIf you have been invited to eat, keep in mind that you don't need to express thanks before meals like the French or the Japanese. Rather, eat heartily and then thank your host afterwards by shaking his hand.\nKeep in mind that believing in mysterious beings is part of the tradition in Iceland. Indeed, most of the unique and sometimes strange rock formations in Iceland are due to elves , according to the people of Iceland.\nAre you planning to spend Christmas in Iceland? If so, make sure you practice saying \"Gleileg jol got tog fars!\" first, which is the local Christmas greeting. It is part of the tradition in Iceland to have long Christmas holidays--26 days--longer than in any other European country. There are 13 Santa Clauses in Iceland, too!\nThere may not be a law requiring you to follow the customs, but there is no harm in doing so. Following them, you might be rewarded with a rich cultural experience and a more meaningful trip.", "id": "high5250.txt"}
