This feeling is often called \"culture shock\" and it is important to learn how to deal with culture shock. First of all, you should know that everyone in a new situation will go through some form of culture shock. There are four general stages of cultural adjustment .\nThe first stage is usually referred to as the honeymoon stage. Upon arriving in a new environment, you'll be interested in the new culture. Everything will seem exciting, and everyone will seem friendly and helpful.\nThe second stage is called the withdrawal stage. The excitement that you felt before changes to frustration  as you find it difficult to deal with new problems. The language is hard to learn; friends are hard to make; simple things like shopping and going to the bank are challenges. It is at this stage that you are likely to feel anxious and homesick.\nIf you are one of those who manage to stick it out  , you will enter the third stage---- the recovery stage. At this point, you'll feel more confident in the new culture. You'll start to understand and accept the way things are done and the way people behave in your new environment.\nThe last stage is the stability stage---- this is the point when people start to feel at home in the new culture. At this stage, you will behave well in the new culture, and prefer some aspects  of the new culture to your own culture.\nThere is, in a sense, a fifth stage to this process. If you decide to return home after a long period in a new culture, you may experience what is called \"reverse culture shock\". This means that you may find aspects of your own culture \"foreign\", because you're so used to the new culture. Reverse culture shock is usually pretty mild  and doesn't last for very long.", "id": "high14698.txt"}
