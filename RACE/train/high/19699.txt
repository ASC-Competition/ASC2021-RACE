I am practically living out of my savings. I have been looking for a job,but things are really bad and 1 cannot find a single person who wants to hire me. I know that the main problem is that I do not have a degree. I want to go back to school and get my degree,but I also need a job now. I owe money to some people who have been helping me. Because I am out of work,I cannot pay them back. What do you think 1 should do? I need to find a job as quickly as possible, and want to know what else to do to get people to give me a chance to work for them.\nThe Unemployed.\nDear Unemployed,\nBefore you get              yourself in a really bad situation, you need to stop borrowing money from people. If you continue doing that,you will be deep in debts and the situation will get even worse for you. The next thing you need to do is look for a job depending on your abilities, skills, and experience. By doing that, you will be increasing your chances of finding a job              that              suits              you best. And the last thing I will suggest is that you should stop feeling sorry for yourself and continue working hard to get a job that you need. Borrowing money, complaining, and feeling bad for your situation will              do no good to you.              Stay strong and get              out there and              start showing the world what you can offer. I promise if you work hard and never give up,you will soon find the job that you are looking for. And while you are doing it,thing about getting your degree as well because it will help you to become more challenging. Try those tips.\nThe Coach", "id": "high19699.txt"}
