You get onto an almost-empty bus, but the next passenger in decides to ignore dozens of empty seats to sit right next to you. While you're waiting in line at a supermarket, the next customer insists on standing only two inches behind you and shouting into his cell-phone. You go into a public restroom, and the next person to enter decides to use the next stall. Transgressions  like these don't just make us feel uncomfortable; we often feel anxious, alarmed; and violated . It is the attack of the personal-space invaders.\nIn any society, shared definitions of personal space govern how we interact with other people. People living in densely  populated cities like Mumbai, Beijing, or Mexico City tend to require less personal space than people living in sparsely  populated places within the country. In America, New Yorkers often have smaller requirements than residents of western states, like Montana, Shenandoah and Wyoming. Because everyone has different standards, gestures that are innocent in one place can be interpreted as opposite in another, especially in Britain.\nAs the British etiquette  website Debrett puts it, as a British person, somebody standing too close may make you \"focus less on what somebody is saying than on how close they are to you\". Simple acts like putting an arm around someone you don't know may seem friendly in China, but they can make us very uncomfortable. People from many European countries such as France and Spain kiss each other on the cheek when they meet, yet to British person, this seems too friendly and \"touch-freely\". The website explains! \"The British are not backslappers  and generally do not show affection in public\".\nAre British people unfriendly? Far from it. The website adds that they are not as \" _ ' as they may seem, but very friendly and helpful to foreigners. However, remember not to be too close. If you are going to come closer than an arm's length, please let them know.", "id": "high14965.txt"}
