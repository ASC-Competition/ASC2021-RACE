I didn't think there would be any difficulty in getting it mended, as there are a lot of antique   shops near my home. So I left home one morning carrying the chair with me. I went into the first shop expecting a friendly reception. I was quite wrong. The man wouldn't even look at my chair.\nThe second shop, though slightly more polite, was just the same, and the third and the fourth...So I decided that my approach must be wrong.\nI entered the fifth shop with a plan in my mind. I placed the chair on the floor and said to the shopkeeper, \"Would you like to buy a chair?\" He looked it over carefully and said, \"Yes. How much do you want for it, sir?\" \"Twenty pounds,\"I said, \"OK,\"he said. \"I'll give you twenty pounds.\" \"It's got a slightly broken leg,\"I said. \"Yes, I saw that, it's nothing.\"\nEverything was going according to plan and I was getting excited. \"What will you do with it?\" I asked. \"Oh, it will be easy to sell once the repair is done.\" \"I'11 buy it.\" I said. \"What do you mean?\" \"You've just sold it to me.\" he said. \"Yes, I know but I've changed my mind. I am sorry. I'll give you twenty-seven pounds for it.\"\"You must be crazy. \"he said. Then, suddenly the penny dropped. \"I know what you want. You want me to repair your chair.\" \"You're right.\"I said. \"And what would you have done if I had walked in and said, 'Would you mend this chair for me?'\" \"I wouldn't have agreed to do it,\" he said. \"We don't do repairs, not enough money in it and too much trouble. But I'll mend this for you, shall we say for a fiver?\" He was a very nice man and was greatly amused  by the whole thing.", "id": "high12095.txt"}
