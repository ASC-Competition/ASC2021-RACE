What would be the best title for the passage?"], "article": "Bernice Gallego sat down one day this summer, as she does pretty much every day,and began listing items on eBay. She dug into a box and pulled out a baseball card. She stopped for a moment and admired the picture. \"Red Stocking B. B. Club of Cincinnatti,\" the card read, under the reddish brown color photo of ten men with their socks pulled up to their knees.\nAs a collector and seller, it's her job to spot old items that might have value today. It's what Bernice,72, and her husband, Al Gallego, 80, have been doing since 1974 at their California antique store.\nThis card, she figured, was worth selling on eBay. She took a picture, wrote a description and put it up for auction.She put a $10 price tag on it, deciding against $15 because it would have cost her an extra 20 cents. Later that night she got a few odd inquiries---someone wanting to know whether the card was real, someone wanting her to end the caution and sell him the card immediately.\nThe card is actually 139 years old. Sports card collectors call the find \"extremely rare\" and estimate the card could\nfive, or perhaps, six figures at caution.\nJust like that, Bernice is the least likely character ever for a rare-baseball card story. \"I didn't even know baseball existed that far back,\" Gallego says, \"I don't think that I've ever been to a baseball game.\" The theory is that the card came out of a storage space they bought a few years back. It is not uncommon in their line of work to buy the entire contents of storage units for around $200.\nWhen she met with card trader Rick Mirigian, she found out what the card was-----an 1869 advertisement with a picture of the first professional baseball team, the Cincinnatti Red Stocking.\n\"When I came to meet her and she took it out of a sandwich bag and she was smoking a cigarette, I almost fainted,\" Mirigian says. \" They've uncovered a piece of history that few people will ever be able to imagine. That card is history. It's like unearthing a Mona Lisa or a Picasso.\"", "id": "high16069.txt"}
