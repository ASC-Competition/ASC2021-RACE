OK, that's not true. But competitors from around the world gathered on Thursday to compete for the title of 2012's World's Biggest Liar.\nEach participant is given up to five minutes to make up the best lie in the competition, which was started in honor of 19th-century Bridge Inn owner Will Ritson, who was reportedly famous for his lies. Competitors gather at the Bridge Inn every year for the competition, a small pub in northwestern England. Anyone can take part in the competition. Well, almost anyway; the reporters note that lawyers and politicians are banned, who is said to enjoy \"an unfair advantage\" in the proceedings .\nA study published this past July in the journal Evolution & Human Behavior found that nearly all lies are detectable through visible facial muscle   reactions in the person telling a lie. \"Thus, while interpersonal deception   often is highly successful, signs of hidden emotional states are communicated clearly to the informed observer,\" the study concluded.\nA churchman of Carlisle reportedly holds what may be the greatest lie of all time in the competition, simply stating, \"I have never told a lie in my life.\"\nIn 2003, Abrie Krueger of South Africa became the first non-Brit to win the competition. Ironically, Krueger was accused by some of cheating.\nIn 2006, comedian Sue Perkins became the first female to win the competition, telling a tale about people riding camels to work as a result of climate change.\nLast year's winning entry came from Glen Boyland, who told a lie about competing in a snail-racing   competition with Prince Charles.", "id": "high23338.txt"}
