Sometimes the third graders didn't welcome Philip into their group and usually tricked him. This was not because he was older, but because he was \"different\". You see, Philip suffered from a _ called Downs's Syndrome. This made him \"different\", with his facial characteristics, slow responses and mental problems.\nOne Sunday after Easter, the Sunday school teacher gathered some plastic eggs that pulled apart in the middle. The teacher gave one to each child. On that beautiful spring day, the children were to go out and discover for themselves some symbol of \"new life\" and place it inside the plastic eggs.\nAfter the children returned to the classroom, the teacher opened their eggs one by one, asking each child to explain that symbol of \"new life\". The first opened egg contained a flower. Everyone cheered. In another was a butterfly.... When the teacher opened the last egg, it was empty. \"That's stupid,\" said someone. The teacher felt a pull at his shirt. It was Philip. Looking up, Philip said, \"It's mine. I did it. It's empty. I have new life, because the tomb is empty.\" Not a sound was heard in class at all. From that day on, Philip became a real part of the group. They welcomed him, and whatever made him different was never mentioned again.\nPhilip's family knew he wouldn't live a long life, for there were too many things wrong with him.", "id": "high2224.txt"}
