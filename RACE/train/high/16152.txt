Studying at university or working for a living? Take a look at what Albert Einstein was doing at the age of 26.\n100 years ago, Einstein was working in Switzerland. His hobby was physics. Without much money or help, he wrote five papers  for a physics magazine. Three of these greatly changed the study of physics and our understanding of space, time, light and matter . His most famous work is on the Theory of Relativity . Einstein was given the Nobel Prize for his discoveries. Although he also did many other things later, the years 1905 has been called Einstein's \"Year of Wonders\". It has been 100 years since then. Because of this, the UN has named 05 the World Year of Physics.\nToday, over fifty years after Einstein's death, a question is asked,  \" Will there ever be another Einstein?\" It may take a long time. After all, Einstein was born more than 200 years after Sir Isaac Newton, another great scientist. Besides, physics is a different field now, and education is different, too. Even if you can't be the next great scientist, it is still helpful to remember some of the things that made Einstein great. He thought independently  and read widely. He left with us a formula  for life: If A is a success in life, then A=\"X+Y+Z.\" X is work, Y is play, and Z is keeping your mouth shut.", "id": "high16152.txt"}
