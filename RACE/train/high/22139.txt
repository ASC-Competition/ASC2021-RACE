There are days when you wish everyone on the other side of the door would simply disappear for about an hour so you can come home and relax without having to start dinner, bathe children, iron clothes for the next day.  In fact, finding time to be by yourself is totally necessary if you wish to live a happy,  and purpose driven life.\nIf there is noise going on around you it's impossible to hear the quiet voice that speaks inside of us--that guides us and gives us direction on which path we should take and that is no good.  Most of the stuff that we need- to get done,  does nothing towards our personal development.If you simply let life direct you,  you will find that there is never time to take simply for yourself.
