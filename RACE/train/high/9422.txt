Millions of Chinese came to the Shanxi village to visit its terraced fields   and \"splendid\" irrigation systems.\nIt was not until 1978 when Guo Fenglian, head of the village, paid a visit to the US that China's model village found how far it had fallen behind those in developed countries.\n\"I was astonished at their modern equipment in harvesting, which could even separate big tomatoes with small ones,\" said Guo. \"American farmers' life quality also impressed me a lot. Every day they had two cups of milk, which is something we don't have even in our wildest dreams.\"\n\"We have to learn their advanced technology and administration for our own development,\" said then first Deputy Prime Minister Deng Xiaoping who was planning China's reform and opening up policy then. \"Through opening our doors, we would not only take advantage of foreign funds  , but also create job opportunities and cultivate   talents.\"\nIn 1978 Japanese electricity giant Panasonic   came to China as the first foreign business to invest   here and its success attracted other world brands into exploring the Chinese market. So far China has for 15 years taken in the world's second biggest foreign investment, following the US, to help set the country in a fast growth.\nHowever, China's 30-year road of reform was not always smooth. Doubts on the reform began to rise at the end of the 1980s as many people worried the country would turn to capitalism  .\n\"The criterion for our judgment is whether it helps develop socialist productive forces, whether it helps increase the overall national strength of a socialist country, and whether it brings about better living standards,\" said Deng.\n\"China's reform and opening up is a unique success story. It has brought benefit to both China and the world,\" said William Keller, chief manager of a Swiss pharmaceutical   company.", "id": "high9422.txt"}
