Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it.\nShouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \"take a deep breath and count to 10\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry.\nAnother expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \"biting their lip\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \"bite your lip.\"\nBut sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly.\nIf you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \"pardon my French\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset.", "id": "high5084.txt"}
