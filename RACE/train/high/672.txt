They hoped it would provide enough electricity to light up a part of the great city.\nThey bought several machines with them. These were called generators , which produced electricity power for lamps in Edison's building.\nSoon there were lights for the building. Edison lived in a room facing the street and he often worked over night. The light burned brightly and steadily and he often worked over night. People often came and stopped their horse-drawn carriage to look. Everyone knew that Thomas Edison was in town.\nFirst, the inventor and his assistants produced several large generators. A great deal of power would be needed to light up even a small part of the city. Then the workers were busy digging deep trenches in the hard earth below the city streets, and Edison had fourteen miles of wire laid into the trenches. The wire connected each building to a generator.\nSetting up an electric power system was not an easy job. It took a year and a half. In September, 1882, the job was finished.\nA small group of men stood around Edison inside the power house. The big moment came at last. The inventor, taking a deep breath, pulled a switch. The electric lights flashed up.\n\"Very good! Very good!\" a man nearby shouted to praise Edison for what he had done.\n\"Sir,\" said Edison, \"this is only the beginning!\" And Edison was right. Soon Edison's lamp were lighting up cities all over the world.", "id": "high672.txt"}
