Once children can read skillfully, parents tend to step back, and this usually happens at the age of seven or eight. The report also found that 82% of teachers blame the government's \"target--driven\" education policies for the fact that fewer children are reading for pleasure.\nThey believe that a straitjacket   of strictly organized schooling is containing young people's ability to read more widely. Two-thirds of teachers surveyed said they lacked time in the school day to introduce a variety of books and that this was a \"major obstacle to being able to develop a level of reading\". Teachers also cited as main factors the reduction in the number of school librarians, who could put interesting books before children, and the rise in \"screen time\", switching children from reading to playing games.\nThe majority of teachers said the curriculum's     \" emphasis on reading as a skill to be  mastered\" was increasing the pressure. This was _ by parents who saw reading just as a focus of learning, a skill critical to career advancement in a competitive world.\nReading habits and the digital revolution in publishing were key topics of debate at the conference. The theme of the lack of British culture was supported by children's writer Frank Cottrell Boyce, who wrote the scripts( ) for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Olympics.\n\"We discovered the whole nation had forgotten that they did the industrial revolution,\" he said.\n\"Books are so central to it; books can be written by anyone. A lot of the pleasure of a book is listening to somebody read it to you. \"\n\"We found a real love of reading among teachers, and a strong desire ,to encourage more   children to read for pleasure ,\"said Rob Cheney,\" However, the teachers also had an overpowering sense of frustration with their situation.\" \"Touch-screen phone and tablets ( )are naturally attractive to children ,\" the survey Said ,and predicted a period of awkwardness as everyone else adapts . By 2018, children's television will have adopted the presence of this second screen, and it \"will be strange not to have children, at home drawing along on tablets and then having these appearing live in the show \".\nThe hope is \"that user-friendly screens could, if material is adapted and downloaded easily, present an opportunity for more ambitious publishing - for example, books children can either read or choose to have read to them; or digital books with moving pictures instead of photos to clarify factual and scientific points. Parental controls that are easy to use would be key, the conference was told, such as \"a warning for when devices use the Wi-Fi, especially after bedtimes\", to allow parents to shut off access to children in the home.", "id": "high7240.txt"}
