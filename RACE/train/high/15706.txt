However, every dolphin will welcome having their busy, tiring day interrupted by tourists screaming and pushing around them in the water. Worse yet, when dolphins get too near to the boats loaded with tourists, they could get caught up in ropes and killed by propellers .\nHere's a little secret.

But they can be quite annoying, standing in front of you, holding up their cameras to prevent you from seeing anything.
