Han has over 38 million followers on Sina Weibo, China's major micro-blogging platform. He has broadcast the filming process of the movie to his followers since he began shooting. The film's trailer was released online in May, only three days after shooting and it has been viewed 4.7 million times.\n\"I don't care too much about the surprising numbers online, and what matters more is whether the movie is good or not,\" Han once said.\nHowever, when he invited popular singer, Pu Shu, to write the closing song for the movie, he must have had another idea in mind.\nPu, who has been away from the public eye for some 11 years, also brings a new element for the movie claiming to be devoted to young people. The song became very popular as soon as it was released online.\nNo one knows what other trump cards will be thrown on the table during the tense online campaign this summer.", "id": "high8777.txt"}
