The planes were lost in Burma during World War II. David Cundall, 62, traveled to Burma a dozen times. He spent about US $207,000 in the hope of finding a British Spitfire buried in the Southeast Asian country. Finally, his hard work paid off.\nCundall started his search after his friend heard from a group of U.S. war veterans that they had buried Spitfires in the region. \"We've done some pretty silly things in our time, but the silliest was burying Spitfires,\" the veterans said.\nCundall began placing ads in magazines to try to find soldiers who might have been involved. After 15 years of searching, he finally managed to locate the missing airplanes. The planes had never been flown and were buried in their transport crates . \"We made a borehole and used a camera to look at the crates. They seemed to be in good condition.\" Cundall told The Telegraph. The aircraft had arrived at a Royal Air Force base in Burma in August 1945. But, by that point in the war, the planes weren't needed. \"In 1945, Spitfires were _ , and you could see them everywhere.\" Said Cundall.\nBritish Prime Minister, David Camerion, recently visited the country. As The Telegraph reports, Camerion's help may mean that the Spitfires could soon be on their way back to the United Kingdom. Cundall hopes that with the help of investors, the planes can finally take to the skies.\n\"Spitfires are beautiful aeroplanes and should not be rotting away in a foreign land,\" Cundall says. \"They saved our neck in the Battle of Britain and they should be protected.\"", "id": "high9501.txt"}
