With an important meeting to attend, I was in a hurry , so I didn't take a cart   on my way inside. As I walked between the shelves in the store, I passed by a young couple and their baby. I continued going through the store, picked up a few items I needed and ended up standing behind this couple in the checkout line.\nWhile waiting, I noticed that the young father was holding his money tightly and nervously. The young mother was carrying a baby in her arms and asked the cashier   for a job application.\nWhen the total was rung up, they had to pick items out of their cart because they didn't have enough money. But all their items were basic necessities  that they needed most. It just broke my heart to watch the couple try to think about what they could do without. However, they were able to _ their items and paid the bill with the money that they had.\nAfter they left, I quietly asked the cashier to add those items to mine. The cashier rang everything up, and then got me a shopping cart. We put in their items and I hurried over to their car. \"This is for you,\" I told them.\nThe young father just looked at me with such appreciation and thanked me. I will never forget the expression in his eyes. As I was getting into my car, they drove over. The young mother said, \"Miss, thank you so much.\"\nTears welled up in my eyes---as they are again now, while I write this. \"You are so welcome. Pay it forward some day,\" I replied.", "id": "high9373.txt"}
