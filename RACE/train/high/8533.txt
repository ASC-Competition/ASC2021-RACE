Moncure Elementary School. We have a very busy and exciting year in store for us!\nBefore I give you a short preview of some of the subjects to be covered during the course of this year, let me first introduce myself. I am Elaine Bogucki and I have lived in Stafford County since 1987 with my husband. This will be my fourteenth year at Anne E. Moncure Elementary School and I consider myself very fortunate to be among such a professional faculty .\nI realize that teaching your child is a _ , as well as a very great responsibility. I will do my best this year to ensure that each student has a motivating and safe learning experience in the classroom. However, I cannot do this alone: I need your help. We both need to be partners in the learning process. I need each of you to encourage your child at home by helping to ensure that they have completed their assignments, and help them study for tests, if necessary. I will keep you informed of all assignments and subjects that are covered in class with a weekly summary.\nFinally, I have prepared some information that may help answer some of your questions about our subjects and classroom. I know that with your help we are going to have a great year!\nSincerely,\nMrs. Elaine Bogucki", "id": "high8533.txt"}
