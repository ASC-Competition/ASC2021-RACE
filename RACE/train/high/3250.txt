She is my mom, Lili.\nWhen I was nine, Lili quitted her job and started her own business. She said she didn't want to stay at home and work as a housewife: \"It's a waste of life.\" Lili became so busy that she spent less and less time with me. She didn't help me with my schoolwork. It was, in her words, \"so that you can develop your independence\". We quarreled because she rarely showed up at parents' meetings.\nLike mother, like daughter. I have many things in common with Lili. I want everything to be under control. I want to be perfect and I don't expect other people to help me. I push myself hard to achieve my goals.\nAfter I started to go to high school, Lili and I were too busy to communicate much with each other.\nIn biology class I began to be depressed. When the teacher showed us a picture of a butterfly, I was scared and screamed. I had a vision of thousands of butterflies flying toward me.\nThat night I told Lili about it. The next morning, I saw that she had red eyes with black circles around them.\nShe took me to see a therapist  . Three hours later, the therapist told Lili that my life was like a wheel spinning   faster and faster and that was the reason for what had happened to me. I only realized it when my body couldn't stand the pressure anymore. At these words, Lili burst into tears. \"It's all my fault, she's just a kid and I didn't have time to take care of her....\" To be honest, I had never seen Lili cry before.\nAfter that, Lili began to spend more time at home, cooking and dragging me to do sports. I realized she was the one who would always be there when I was in real trouble. No mom is perfect, but she is the one who really cares about her kid.", "id": "high3250.txt"}
