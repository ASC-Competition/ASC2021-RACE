Experts from across many fields are full of advice on just how to present your best performance in an interview using conscious   body language choices. While many of these experts say there is a \"secret\" system for making the most of an interview, the reality is that most of them focus on a few general types of behavior that have the greatest effect during a job interview.\nEntering the interview location -- Your walk should be active and confident. Keep your shoulders straight, head up, and make eye contact with the people around you. Maintain   an active facial expression and be confident when shaking hands and greeting people to whom you are introduced. \nDuring the interview -- Sit in a straight and attentive posture. Never let your shoulders drop or your head hang down, but rather keep your head up and make eye contact with the interviewers. Don't play with any papers or notes you have in front of you, and don't lean   your arms heavily on the table. Keep your body position open and make eye contact while listening to and answering questions. \nLeaving the interview location--No matter how you feel about your performance during the interview, carry yourself with confidence till you leave the interview location. Be confident when shaking hands and making eye contact as you say goodbye, and keep your body posture straight as you walk all the way to your car.\nRemember, the more you make active and confident body language a part of your daily life, the more it becomes a habit that follows you wherever you go.", "id": "high18416.txt"}
