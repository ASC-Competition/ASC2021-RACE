And now pilots can order their own \"roadable\"plane for just PS 127,000.\n    The plane,which has fold-out wings that span 17. 5 ft,has a range of flying distance of 460 miles and can be up to 115 mph.

You will always be ready to drive or fly. \"\n      The spokeswoman added,\"Never let bad weather change your trip. You call simply divert and continue on the ground until the weather clears. \"    \n      There's no risk to you--This is only the chance for you to be the first at your home field to unfold your wings and fly into the future.", "id": "high18721.txt"}
