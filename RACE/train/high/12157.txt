Family and friends loved her designs and asked for more. When admirers suggested that Raeann sell her bracelets, she realized she wanted to do just that -- and donate the money to help kids with special needs, like her brother Derek.\nRaeann's older brother, Derek, has cri du chat syndrome. Children with cri du chat usually have problems understanding ideas and might have a hard time learning to talk. Many also have weak muscles that can cause problems with walking or using their fingers to pick things up. The term cri du chat means \"cry of the cat\" in French. Babies with cri du chat often have a high-pitched cry that sounds like that of a little cat.\nOver the years, Derek's teachers helped him learn sign language and gestures. They also taught him skills such as recognizing letters, cutting with scissors, and understanding basic math. Raeann wanted to donate money to Derek's school. \"I just wanted to help my brother,\" she says, \"and the people who help him.\"\nAt first, Raeann focused on creating jewelry that would raise awareness for cri du chat. But people started requesting bracelets to wear as a symbol of support and awareness for a variety of other diseases and disorders. To create those symbols, Raeann researched the color most often associated with raising awareness for the disease or disorder, such as pink for breast cancer or orange for leukemia.\nIn the end, it turned out to be a great idea. In only a few years, Raeann has donated more than $30,000 to local charities. Raeann's mom says that working on the bracelets has developed the generosity and kindness that already existed in her daughter. Raeann plans to keep making bracelets and raising dollars for charities. \"I just want to keep going on with it,\" she says, \"to help my brother more.\"", "id": "high12157.txt"}
