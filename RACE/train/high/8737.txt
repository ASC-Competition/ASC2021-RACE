His thin arms and legs can hardly support any weight, and he is unable to take care of himself. However, his hands are able to produce fine paper-cuts, which will free his daughter from the same disease.\nTo support himself, he learned how to make paper-cut art from his mother. He sold his artwork and taught his techniques in Xi'an for eight years before discovering his young daughter _ the disease from him, leading Zhang to move his family to Beijing for his daughter's better treatment five years ago.\nThe daughter's treatment costs about 30,000 yuan a year. The family's savings was used up in two years, and Zhang was forced to start to sell his work in underground passages with his healthy wife, who soon left him because of the hard life.\nWith a little help from government, he was lucky to meet some kindhearted people in Beijing. A Hong Kong businessman gave 60,000 yuan to him last year to treat the girl and start a small shop on Qiangulouyuan, which is known as a famous hutong that attracts lots of tourists over holidays. Zhang Rui, a university graduate, spends most of her time helping Zhang sell the paper-cuts, translating the stories of the paper-cuts into English and selling the works on the roadside of Nanluoguxiang.\nHowever, the artist still lives beyond his income   and struggles to continue his small business. \"Selling paper-cuts is his only source of income. Without this, he can't support the family and treat his daughter,\" says Zhang Rui, who hopes more people will help Zhang.", "id": "high8737.txt"}
