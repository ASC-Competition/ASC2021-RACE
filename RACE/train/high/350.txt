My husband suggested we give her a computer to play against. I wasn't sure my mother was ready for it. After all, it had taken 15 years to persuade her to buy an electric cooker. Even so, we packed up our old computer and delivered it to my parents' home. And so began my mother's adventure in the world of computers.\nIt also marked the beginning of an unusual teaching task for me. I've taught people of all ages, but I never thought I would be teaching my mother how to do anything. She has been the one teaching me all my life; to cook and sew; to enjoy the good times and put up with the bad. Now it was my turn to give something back.\nIt wasn't easy at the beginning. There was so much to explain and to introduce. Slowly but surely, my mother caught on, making notes in a little notebook. After a few months of Scrabble and other games, I decided it was time to introduce her to word processing . This proved to be a bigger challenge  to her, so I gave her some homework. I asked her to write me a letter, using different letter types, colors and spaces.\n\"Are you demanding this with your kindergarten pupils?\" she said.\n\"No, of course not,\" I said. \"They already know how to use a computer.\"\nMy mother isn't the only one experiencing a fast personal growth period. Thanks to the computer, my father has finally got over his phone allergy . For as long as I remember, and time I called, my mother would answer, Dad and I have had more phone conversations in the last two months than we've had in the past 20 years.", "id": "high350.txt"}
