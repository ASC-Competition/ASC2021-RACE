But my daydream was interrupted by an elderly woman talking loudly into her cell phone. She kept asking the person to meet her where she was and was repeating the gate number into the phone. With each repeat she got a little louder. All the people around were trying to avoid laughing.   \nThen I heard her say, \"I' m sorry, I can't hear you .There seems to be something wrong with my hearing aid.\" As I waited for my turn to board ,I noticed her tone was becoming increasingly frantic as she tried to understand the person on the other end of the phone.\nIt was almost my turn to board. I couldn't stop looking back at the woman .It made me think how lucky I was to have my hearing .Then I realized I could do something to help. \nI walked over to the woman and shouted ,\"Let me help you hear .I'll tell you what the person is saying.\" The doubt that flickered  across her face was quickly replaced with understanding ,then relief .\nI took the phone from her, listen for a moment, and then told the woman that her husband was waiting for her in the baggage area as he could not enter the gate area. Then I pointed her in the right direction.\nIt took me less than two minutes to help the woman, but my pride in having been able to help her remains strong.", "id": "high16719.txt"}
