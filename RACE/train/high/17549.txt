Our first encounter was in October 2010, when my husband and I were there for a week to visit the city we would be calling home for the next few years. Once we entered the city, what impressed us was its vibrancy and almost immediately I was convinced to make that city our home. A few months later, we settled down and I loved everything about Hong Kong! The wet markets, the modern shopping malls, the bargaining at Mongkok, the fine foods...there is so much to experience. \nThen came the MBA, which took the entire experience to a different level.
