But officials say most of these do not have the anti-pollution equipment or measures they should have. \nBecause of the lack of waste treatment facilities, wasted water and other rubbish from residential areas in nearby towns and villages flow into rivers which are connected to TaihuLake. This also contributed to the lake's pollution.\n Realizing the seriousness of the situation, the provincial and local governments began to tackle the problem.\n Experts were invited to offer suggestions and laws and regulations were issued. All newly built factories and enterprises in the lake area were required to install necessary anti-pollution facilities before they can go into operation.\nAlso, some wasted water treatment works will be built in the three cities.", "id": "high22341.txt"}
