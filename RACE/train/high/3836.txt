In his book The Natural History of Selbourne (1786), the naturalist Gilbert White tells how he _ removed one egg a day from a kind of bird Plover's nest, and how the mother laid another egg each day to make up for the missing one. He notes that other kinds of birds ignore the loss of a single egg, but if more than one egg has been removed, they will give up their nests. It has also been noted that a certain type of bees always provides five--never four, never six--caterpillars   for each of their eggs so that their young have something to eat when the eggs have hatched out. Research has also shown that both mice and pigeons can be taught to distinguish between odd   and even   numbers of food pieces.\nThese have led some people to think that creatures can actually count. They also point to dogs that have been taught to respond to questions about numbers with the correct number of barks.\nAnimals respond to quantities only when they are connected to survive as in the case of the eggs, or survive as in the case of food. They can \"count\" only when the objects are present and only when the numbers involved are small--no more than seven or eight. In lab experiments, animals which are trained to count one kind of objects were unable to count any other type. What interests them are the objects, not the numbers. Animals' achievements simply are not equal to evidence of counting. They only show the results of clever, careful training.", "id": "high3836.txt"}
