The bus for London would not leave until five to twelve. He saw a lot of people waiting in the station. Some were standing in lines, others were walking about. There was a group of school-girls. Their teacher was trying to keep them in order. Tom looked around but there was nowhere for him to sit.\nHe walked into the station cafe. He looked up at the clock there. It was only twenty to twelve. He found a seat and sat down, facing a large mirror on the wall. Just then, John, one of Tom's friends, came in and sat with Tom.\n\"What time is your bus?\" asked John.\n\"Oh, there is plenty of time yet,\" answered Tom.\n\"Oh, I'll get you some more tea then,\" said John.\nThey talked while drinking. Then Tom looked at the clock again.\n\"Good heavens! It's going back-ward!\" he cried. \"A few minutes ago it was twenty to twelve and now it's half past eleven.\" \"You are looking at the clock in the mirror,\" said John.\nTom wanted to kick himself for being so foolish. The next bus was not to leave for another hour. He has never liked mirror since then.", "id": "high153.txt"}
