The Treehotel, located in a place called Harads, will consist of four rooms when it opens on July 17th: the Cabin, the Blue Cone, the Nest, and the Mirrorcube.\nTwo additional rooms are scheduled to open in October. The long term vision  is even more _ . \"Our goal in five years is to have 24 rooms from 24 different architects,\" says Treehotel co-founder Kent Lindvall.\nThe first six rooms were designed by five different architects. The Mirrorcube which stands four meters high and four meters wide, and the walls of which are made with a mirrored glass, has drawn widespread attention as it will be attached to a single tree. \"It's an interesting building. You can't find anything else like this in the world today. It's unique ,\" says Lindvall. \"Everything will reflect in it---the trees, the birds, the clouds and the sun in the forest. So it could hardly be seen in the forest. This is untouched forest and we want to keep it the same way.\"\nLindvall says the Treehotel's vision proves a powerful draw, with enquiries  coming in from far and wide. \"I think what's exciting here is that we're just 60 km below the Arctic Circle. It means there's a good possibility to have the northern lights in the winter and of course to have the midnight sun in the summer.\"\nThe motto of the Treehotel is \"Feel Free in a Tree\" and expense will cost up to about $555.50 for two guests in the Cube, which is designed to hold up to four guests.", "id": "high1686.txt"}
