That means longer days instead of the traditional Monday through Friday schedule.\nHaving been approved for three years and beginning in the fall, students in the Maccray school district in Minnesota will be in school from Tuesday to Friday. Each school day will be 65 minutes longer. Officials say the district expects to save about sixty-five thousand dollars a year in transportation costs.\nIn new Mexico, the first school district changed to a four-day week in 1974 because of the Arab oil boycott . Now, 17 out of 89 districts use it.\nIn Custer, South Dakota, students have been going to school four days a week since 1995. Superintendent Tim Creal says the change has saved about one million dollars over just the past eight years. He sees other benefits, too. Students get more instructional time, and activities that used to take up class time are now held on non-school days. He says that in the future, the growth of online classes could make it possible to require even fewer days in school. High fuel prices are driving college students to take more online classes.\nA four-day school week sounds like a great idea for students and teachers, but working parents may have to pay for child care for that fifth day.", "id": "high3389.txt"}
