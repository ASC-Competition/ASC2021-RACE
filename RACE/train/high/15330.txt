Bush is expected to issue a directive in the next few weeks. It will give the US Air Force a green light for the development of space weapons, US media reported last week.\nThis would potentially start a new global arms race, some experts have warned.\nTo keep that from happening, last Wednesday the White House explained that it was not considering putting weapons in space. It said it was making a shift in US space policy to allow for protection of satellites.\nBut some defense analysts and arms control advocates argue that the policy will pave the way for the US to put both defensive and offensive  weapons in space.\n\"No one should be fooled,\" said Theresa Hitchens, an American weapons expert.\nThe US is now restricted by a 1996 directive  signed by President Bill Clinton. Plans for space weapons were vetoed by the Clinton cabinet. The directive emphasized the peaceful use of space , in agreement with almost unanimous global opinion.\nThe US military has placed importance on space and has sent up numberous satellites for troop communications and to provide intelligence and data to guide bombs to their targets.\nThe US Air Force wants to develop space- based weapons that could strike targets anywhere in the world within 90 minutes of receiving the order to open fire.\nThese new weapons under development cover a wide range. They include hunter- killer satellites and orbiting weapons. And they use lasers, radio waves, or even dense metal tubes, known as \" Rods from God\", dropped from space to do the damage.\nThere are many barriers to the setting up of this kind of program, experts say.\nFirst is the coast. It is estimated that the budget may be US $220 billion to US $ 1 trillion .\nThe technical difficulties of developing reliable space weapons are also a problem.\nAnd, the program will draw strong criticism from around the world. Experts worry about starting a space arms race.", "id": "high15330.txt"}
