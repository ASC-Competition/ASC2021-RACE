But when you cut the fruit open, inside is fresh beef! \n\"Our trees may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it's really true,\" declares Dr. Vincent, director of the UMA Group, which created the amazing trees. \"Vegetarians have been complaining for years that in spite of their firm belief against eating meat, they still desire the taste of meat once in a while. Now they can have their cake and eat it too.\" \nAlthough it's taken 12 years to develop the trees, the idea is simple. \"We take the genes from cattle and put them into the cells of grape-fruit trees,\" Dr. Vincent says. \"When the seeds grow into trees, they produce meat instead of ordinary fruit. You get the taste -- even the smell.\" \nThose who've tried the meat agree it tastes like the real thing. \"I was a bit unwilling to believe at first when I sank my teeth into a hamburger after they told me it grew on a tree,\" says Londoner Mark, who took part in a taste-test. \"But it was juicy and delicious - nothing leafy about it at all.\"\nMeat Tree products could be on the market in Great Britain by the end of next year. Some vegetarians insist they should never eat meat -- even if it grew on a tree. Others love the idea. \"My mouth is watering already,\" says a devoted vegetarian of 20 years.", "id": "high16878.txt"}
