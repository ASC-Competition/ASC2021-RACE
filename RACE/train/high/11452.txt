Three-year-old Teddy Lasry was sleeping in his cowboy outfit   yesterday at his family's Fifth Ave.apartment when he shot up in bed screaming.A 3-foot-long black-and-white snake twisted around his left arm and had just bitten his little finger.\n\"The babysitter (a person taking care of children while their parents are away for a short time) was frightened to death,\" said Teddy's father, David Lasry, who, along with his wife, Evelyn, was at work when the snake appeared about 4:00 pm.\nThe horrified babysitter called 911 and the building's doorman.The doorman and two cable TV workers helped take the snake off the boy's arm and put it in a garbage bag.Police rushed Teddy to Mount Sinai Medical Center, where he spent two hours attached to a heart monitor as a precaution in case the snake was poisonous.It wasn't.Experts at the snakebite treatment center at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, where policemen took the snake, found out it was a non-poisonous California king snake.\nBut how did it end up in Teddy's bed?\nA little detective work determined that the snake had escaped two weeks ago from its cage in the apartment of a doctor whose family lives four floors below the Lasrys.The apologetic owner said his son's pet snake likely traveled up the water pipes and into his neighbor's apartment.\"It's a very gentle, very harmless snake,\" he said.\"It's handled by our family all the time.\"\nDavid Lasry believed the pet was simply hungry after two weeks of wandering.Evelyn said her son seems to have overcome his fright by thinking of himself as a hero cowboy as he rode in the back of the police car to the hospital.\n\"I told Teddy he's a pretty snake, a nice pet snake who got out of his cage,\" Evelyn said.\"But he asked, 'Why did he bite my finger, Mamma?' And I said, 'Because he saw that you are a big boy, Teddy, in your cowboy outfit and he got scared.'\"", "id": "high11452.txt"}
