Moderation is always the safest way to do things, and a virtue we should have. Let's take the student life for example. There are some students who study too hard and play too little, while there are others who play too much and study too little. On the one hand, it is harmful to his health if he has too few physical exercises, and on the other hand, it is harmful to his mind if he plays too much.\nIn the matter of eating, one also should be moderate. Do not eat too much or too little. Too much eating will make you sick, while too little eating will make you weak.\nThe man of progress is he who neither has too high an opinion of himself nor thinks too poorly of himself. If he thinks too highly of himself, he is surely to become very proud, but if he has too poor an opinion of himself, he will have no courage to make an advance. Both the conditions above will make you lose your aim in life. A broadminded man is he who always moves within the orbit  of reasonableness . In any activities in one's life, moderation is one of the best ways to enjoy real happiness.", "id": "high17642.txt"}
