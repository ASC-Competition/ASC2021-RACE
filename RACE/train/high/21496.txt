Billions of printed books have been published, read and saved in the 600 years since movable type was invented, so why mess with a good things?\n       Sony Electronics is doing just that, betting that readers will be won over by the convenience of readability of its new electronic book devices. Sony's reader, the PRS-505, can hold 160 books in its fixed memory, enough to line the shelves on a good-sized wall in the average American home. The $299 device is about the size of a paperback book, but a half-inch thick and weighs less than a pound. \nThe Sony book reader is revolutionary not only in its storage capacity. The font  is highly readable and adjustable by size. Unlike laptop computers, you can put the Sony in your purse, read it in direct sunlight and even bookmark the pages. And you can connect it to your PC to download books.\nSurprisingly, though the reader has liberated the book from paper, electronic books aren't always a bargain. For example, David Baldacci's \"Stone Cold\" download retails  for $15.19 at the Sony site, while Amazon  will deliver a hard copy to your mailbox for $16.19. \nThe Sony reader also lets you store and play or display music. So what's not to like about the Sony? Well, for many  _ , a lot. Book lovers like to have, hold and keep their volumes, which don't need charging. You can write notes in the margin1s, and enjoy the ambience they provide on your book shelves.\nThe need for electronic reading devices is likely to grow as more people worried about the billions of tons of paper used for printed material. Many believe the time will come when devices like the Sony reader are as common as printed newspapers and magazines today.", "id": "high21496.txt"}
