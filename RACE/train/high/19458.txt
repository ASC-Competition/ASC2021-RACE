My parents valued teaching my brothers, sisters and me about saving, budgeting and earning money, but conversations about our family's economic situation and financial decisions were rare. This was typical at the time - especially in the Midwest of the US, so to my friends and me, money was enveloped in some level of secrecy. Later, when my family hit a difficult time, we began having more open conversations about money. And while those talks were very difficult at first, it was a relief to understand more about our family's finances.\nObviously, times haven't changed much when it comes to family money talks. Recent research by an American institute indicates that money remains among the lowest priorities   in conversations between parents and their children. In fact, parents are much more likely to have prioritized discussions about pretty much everything else before money.\nThey're also waiting to have these discussions until their kids are older - 10 0n average - which can cause them to miss many opportunities during their children's formative years.\nTalking about money with your kids can be difficult for many different reasons - especially if your finances seem very personal and private, or if you have anxiety about bills yourself. But discussing money in a calm and open way is pivotal to helping your children learn about and become comfortable with finances before they're expected to manage their own.  While you certainly don't need to provide detailed information about your income to your children, it can be very effective to include them in meaningful financial discussions - even at an early age. Having regular family conversations about money will help them learn about financial concepts  like saving and budgeting, develop financial decision-making skills and form a healthy relationship with money.", "id": "high19458.txt"}
