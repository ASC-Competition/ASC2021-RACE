Clio has a population of 28,000, but it has at least 30 gangs  . The gangs make most of their money from dealing drugs and offering \"protection.\" They also commit violent crimes, such as stealing, robbery or even murder.\nThere were 1,486 thefts last year. Most of the thefts involved cars. Thieves also robbed the people at gunpoint or pick pocketed them. They broke .into houses and businesses at the alarming rate of two a day two years ago, but that rate was down to only one a day last year. \"That's a 50-percent\ndecrease in one year,\" said Gates. \"I think the police officers deserve a big pat on the back. Even better, maybe they'll get that 10-percent raise that they are all hoping for. \"\nWith an example of how the police force has helped reduce crime, Gates talked about bicycle thefts. \"For years and years, kids were locking up their bikes at bike stands in front of schools, libraries, and shopping mails. About 10 percent of the time, the kids would come out of the school or wherever and discover that their bike was no longer there. We wracked our brains( ) trying to find a solution to this problem. Finally, at the beginning of last year, when we simply removed most of the bike stands, then the bicycle theft rate came down quickly.\nMost cities in the state have similar problems. They all involve too many people, too much crime, too few police, and too little money. These problems go along with civilization everywhere. They might reduce, but they will probably never disappear. All people can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst.", "id": "high23366.txt"}
