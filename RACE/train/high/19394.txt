Part of Yasin's studies in Somaliland were spent in a special classroom, lined with rows of computers equipped with webcams and microphones.\nThe 29-year-old watched videos and took part in live virtual  classes at Indiana University as part of her journalism programme at the University of Hargeisa.\"We had discussions and shared any challenges or questions,\" she says.\nThe African Virtual University(AVU), an intergovernmental organization, connected Yasin with Indiana University. The AVU says it has used virtual learning to train 43, 000 students since its creation in 1997.
