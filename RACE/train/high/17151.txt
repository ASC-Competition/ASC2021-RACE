The first was a hundred thousand years old, and the second was around eight million years old. The eight-million-year-old bacteria were alive. But their genes were seriously damaged from long exposure to cosmic ( ) radiation, which is higher at the earth's poles.\nMost of the bacteria in the samples probably blew over from African deserts, said Paul Falkowski, a scientist at prefix = st1 /RutgersUniversity. Once the bacteria landed on the glacier's snowy surface, they combined with the snow to form ice. \"These ices are actually gene banks,\" he added.\nAs glaciers and ice caps melt as a result of increasing global warming, large amounts of bacterial genetic material might be washed into the ocean.\nThese bacteria might get incorporated into today's bacteria in the ocean, or living bacteria from the ice might also grow and have an important effect on the ecosystem.\n\"How that's going to play out, we don't know,\" Bidle said. He and Falkowski plan to focus their future work on how current ice melting influences modem bacteria's genetic diversity.", "id": "high17151.txt"}
