So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed. \nUncertainties about the health and life span   of cloned animals continue to exsist; Dolly died at a young age in 2003 after developing cancer and arthritis. \nWilmut and others  _ Hwang's achievement, reported Wednesday in the journal Nature. But they said politicians and scientists must face the larger issue -- how to go on with the research without crossing the moral boundary of copying human life in the lab.\n\"The ability to use the technology is hopeful,\" said Robert Schenken, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. \"However, the paper also points out that in dogs as in most species, cloning for reproductive purposes is unsafe.\" \nThe cloned puppy was the lone success from more than 100 dogs implanted  with more than 1,000 cloned embryos. \nIn a news conference in Seoul, the cloning team also condemned the reproductive cloning of humans as \"unsafe and inefficient.\" Human reproductive cloning already is banned in South Korea. Other nations, including the United States, are divided on whether to ban just human cloning or cloning of all kinds, including the production of stem cells.", "id": "high20198.txt"}
