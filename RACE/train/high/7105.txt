I took off my nursing shoes, relaxed and then said goodnight to the rest of the girls and headed out of the door.\nIt was so cold and I could see the ice crystals in the air. As I approached my car, I saw one of my coworkers standing by the bus stop. I thought it would only take a couple of extra minutes to give her a ride home, and besides, it was too cold to be standing outside on the coldest night in January.\nWe chatted as I drove and before we knew it, we arrived at her house. As she headed up the steps to her door she turned around. \"Do you know how to get to your house from here?\" \"How hard can it be? I'll just backtrack the way I came.\"\nI started driving.

An elderly man slowly rolled his window down.\nI said, \"I'm lost and don't know how to get back into town.\"\nIn silence, he started driving. I drove behind him.\nFinally I recognized a familiar street. As I turned to head home, I lost sight of my guiding angel. When I pulled into my driveway the warning light for my gas tank turned on.", "id": "high7105.txt"}
