In their study, the researchers examined groups of nine-month-old babies in New South Wales and Britain.\n    And they came across astounding  results. It was found that infants had \"social brains\" and focused not just on their mothers but on social life in groups as well.\n    \"They communicate with more than one baby at once, and show jealousy and generousness,\" said Professor Bradley. \n    He added, \"They develop their own meanings through group interaction, they notice if a group member is behaving differently and they take on roles, such as leaders and followers.\"\n\"A baby who has a depressed mother tends to be withdrawn (  ), but put that same baby in a group of its peers   and they behave and interact like any other baby.\"\nIt was the first all-baby group study ever to be conducted. \"Most studies of babies concentrate on the infant-mother relationship, assuming that is the single foundation for mental health, but babies are constantly involved with groups of people other than their mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents and those taking care. Therefore, the mother-baby approach needs to be combined with a group approach,\" said Bradley.\nPhoebe Christison, a child-care worker at Camperdown Sunshine Bubs in Sydney's inner west, said she often noticed what appeared to be emotional attachments developed between toddlers.\nShe said, \"Joel ( 10 months ) and Isabella ( 11 months ) always like to hold hands when they sit in their high chairs and eat. And babies definitely show jealousy. They push and touch each other, and copy what the other is doing.\"", "id": "high24252.txt"}
