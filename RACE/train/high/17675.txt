Examples of prejudice in schools include believing that some students are particular type of people simply because of the way they dress or act, or believing that a certain group is good at sports simply because many peop1e in that group are goad at sports. Another example is believing that a boy is good at science because many boys are good at science.\n    I would like to cite more examples from the English literature. The best example of \"prejudice\" can be found in Jane Austen's novels. Her novels in the history of English literature are popularly known as \"novels of manners\".Thus you can clearly understand that where manners and social behavior are concerned,\"prejudice\" is inevitable ! Austen' s famous novel Pride and Prejudice is the best example in this respect.
