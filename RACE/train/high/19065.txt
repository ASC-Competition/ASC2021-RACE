Though Goo Goo Clusters may not be as familiar as Kit Kat or Hershey bars, people of all ages have enjoyed it for an entire century.\nIn 1901, a 19-year-old named Howell Campbell opened a candy store in Nashville, Tennessee. He made all kinds of sweets and hard candies with just two copper kettles and about a dozen employees. Then, in 1912, he made the first candy to combine chocolate with other ingredients such as caramel, marshmallow, nougat, and peanuts. Originally, these clusters were hand-wrapped and sold under the counter at a few local stores with a sign reading,\"A nourishing   lunch for a nickel.\" Now, they are known as Goo Goo Clusters. \nWhat else makes a Goo Goo so special?\"In addition to it being the very first-ever combination confection created, its shape also makes it quite unique,'' says Beth Sachan, Goo Goo Clusters' senior marketing manager.\"The Goo Goo Cluster is a big, imperfectly round mound   of deliciousness!\"\nThe 100th anniversary of the Goo Goo Cluster is being celebrated throughout the month of October, the biggest candy-selling month of the year. About 40 restaurants in the Nashville area have created unique desserts inspired by Goo Goo Clusters to serve to their customers.\nAdditionally, a Goo Goo-sponsored race called the \"Jog'n Hog\" was held in Nashville on October 13. Adults and children ran three miles to the finish line after eating at least one of six Goo Goo Clusters from a bag they were given at the halfway point. A golden Goo Goo was hidden in one of the bags. The winner received a $100 gift certificate to the candy's website, googoo. com.", "id": "high19065.txt"}
