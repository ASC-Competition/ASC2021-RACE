About 1, 500 people died on Titanic's _ voyage in 1912 from Southampton to New York after the ship collided with an iceberg in the North Atlantic.\nPalmer, who created the company Blue Star Line last year, refused to make a similar boast.\n\"Anything will sink if you put a hole in it,\"Palmer said. \"I think it would be very cavalier  to say it.\"\nUnlike the original, TitanicII will have more than enough space in its lifeboats for every person on board and will have additional escape staircases. Markku Kanerva, sales director at Deltamarin, the Finnish company designing the ship, said it would be \"the safest cruise ship in the world\".\nPalmer refused to answer questions about the project's cost. Although the Titanic was the world's largest ship in her time, she would be smaller than many of today's modern cruise ships.\n\"It's not about the money, \"Palmer said. \"I've got enough money for it. I think that's all that matters.\"\nForbes estimated Palmer's net worth to be $795 million in 2012. He describes himself as a billionaire.\nTitanicII will be built by Chinese state-owned CSC Jinling Shipyard, which has already built four ore carriers for Palmer's mining business, he said. The contract to build TitanicII has not yet been signed, Palmer said.", "id": "high14929.txt"}
