I found a chained sliding door that was wide enough for me to pass through.\nInside, there was a heavy smell of dead mice in the dark. After my eyes adjusted, I noticed a shaft   that rose all the way to the top of the barn. On one side was a one-man elevator with a long rope and roller.\nI stepped onto the platform and gave the rope a drag and the elevator began sliding up the shaft, but stopped halfway. After a brief panic attack, I noticed holes in the wall at regular intervals, forming a ladder. For reasons known only to an 11-year-old, I decided it would be better to go up than down. So, with shaking hands, I began climbing the wall.\nAfter what seemed like forever, I reached the top of the shaft. I stood up, dusted myself off and found absolutely nothing of interest. It was just an empty room with a ladder leading up to the roof. I climbed all the way up here for this? Then I noticed a fire extinguisher ,which I'd always wanted to shoot off. So this was the chance of a lifetime. I tried it, and, much to my surprise, the thing worked! It shot out a thick cloud of powder that instantly filled the room. I couldn't breathe. I was going to choke to death, and they'd probably never even find my body.\nLuckily, I remembered the ladder to the roof. I climbed up, popped the straw roof and saw a bright blue sky.\nI suddenly realized the dust and powder pouring out of the top could draw attention. So when the dust had settled, I climbed down and slipped out of the chained door. I'm not sure if I was more excited about being alive or about not being caught, but I ran all the way back home.", "id": "high5879.txt"}
