Some children reach eagerly for the treat they see. Some last a few minutes before they give in. But others are determined to wait until the last moment.\nBy the time the children reach high school, something remarkable has happened. A survey found that those who as four-year-olds had enough self-control to hold out generally grew up to be more popular, adventurous, confident and dependable. The children who gave in to temptation  early were more likely to be lonely, easily frustrated and inflexible .\nActually, the ability to delay reward is a sign of emotional intelligence which doesn't show up on an IQ test.\nThe hardware of the brain and the software of the mind have long been scientists' concerns. But brain theory can't explain what we wonder about most, like the question why some people remain _ in the face of troubles that would sink a less resistant soul.\nHere comes the theory of Daniel Goleman, writer of Emotional Intelligence: when it comes to predicting people's success, brain ability measured by IQ may actually matter less than the qualities of mind once thought of as \"character\".\nEQ is not the opposite of IQ. What researchers have been trying to understand is how they work together; how one's ability to handle stress, for instance, affects the ability to concentrate and put intelligence to use. Among the ingredients   for success, researchers now generally agree that IQ counts for about 20%; the rest depends on everything from social class to luck.\nWhile many researchers in this relatively new field are glad to see emotional issues finally taken seriously, some few fear EQ invites misuse.", "id": "high4766.txt"}
