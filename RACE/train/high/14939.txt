Today, four out of five purchases are made electronically in Sweden and going totally cash-free is the next step.\nSweden's public transport system has already been cashless for several years, after local public transport workers complained that handling cash had become dangerous. \"Bus drivers were getting attacked for their money so Sweden banned cash on public transport,\" says Arn Arvidsson, the president of Cashless, an organization supporting the move to a cash-free society. \"There were also a number of bank robberies, so four years ago, the banks began to move away from cash. Now, all of Sweden's big banks operate cash free wherever possible, and the number of bank robberies is at a 30-year low.\"\nThere is, however, concern about how well Sweden's 1.8 million pensioners--out of a total population of 10 million--will adapt. \"A lot of elderly people feel excluded,\" says Johanna Hallen of the Swedish National Pensioners' Organization. \"Only 50% of older people use cash cards regularly and 7% never use cash cards. So we want the government to take things slowly.\"\nThe digital payment revolution is also a challenge for tourists, who need pre-paid tickets or a Swedish mobile to catch a bus in the capital. \"There's a worry about crime and theft as well,\" says Arvidsson. \"Figures show that computer-related credit card crime has almost doubled in the last decade.\"", "id": "high14939.txt"}
