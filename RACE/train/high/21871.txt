Pena ran 10 km daily through the mine's tunnels  to beat the anxiety, wearing cut-down boots until rescuers sent him a pair of sports shoes through a narrow hole that served as the miners' \"lifeline\" to the surface.\n\"When I ran in the darkness, I was running for life,\" Pena told a news conference in New York. \"I was running to show that I wasn't just waiting around. I also wanted God to see that I really wanted to live.\"\nThe New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon, had invited Pena to be a guest at Sunday's race, but he said last week he did not want to watch, he wanted to run. \"I was very eager to take on this big challenge,\" he said. \"I wanted to show the world I could run.\" He hoped to run the 26.2-mile race in about six hours. \"I have a knee injury, but I am eager to cross the finish line,\" he said. Last year, Meb Keflezighi won the men's marathon in two hours, nine minutes and 15 seconds.\nAn Elvis Presley fan who asked rescuers to send the singer's music down into the mine, Pena broke into song at the news conference with the Presley hit Return to Sender. The miners werediscovered alive on August 22--17 days after the mine collapsed, but it took two months for rescuers to dig a hole big enough to bring them out.", "id": "high21871.txt"}
