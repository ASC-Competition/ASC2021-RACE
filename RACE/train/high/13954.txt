I had to go to the airport at 9:00 a.m. to pick up my uncle Ali and take him to my father's house. However, I was late because I was hanging out with my friends. Later that day, around 11:00 a.m., I remembered my uncle, but I was very late. He had already left the airport and taken a taxi to my father's house.\nI got to my father's house at 2:00 p.m. on the same day and looked at my angry father's face. I felt ashamed. After I said hi to my angry father and tired uncle, my father asked me to sit next to him and handed me this watch as a gift. Then he asked, \"Eric, did you have fun with your friends today?\" I answered, \"Yes, father, and I am sorry about not picking up my uncle.\" He said, \"What you did was not very nice and you should be sorry for your actions.\" I was ashamed. \"Father, I'll never do it again. I promise.\" Then he replied, \"I hope today you learned something important, and this watch will be a reminder for you.\" He told me to take this watch and use it as an organizer of my life.\nI learned a very important lesson from my father that day: to respect time and never be late to meet someone. This watch is important to me, not because of its price, but because of the lesson that I learned from it.", "id": "high13954.txt"}
