If any of the instruments is blocked, the astronauts may have trouble getting safely home.\nAs astronauts travel on longer space trips, they must take time to sleep. An astronaut can fit himself to his seat with a kind of seat belt. Or, if he wants to, he can sleep in a sleeping bag which is fixed in place under his seat.But be careful he must put his hands under the belt when he goes to sleep.This is because he is really afraid that he might touch one of controls that isn't supposed to be touched until later.", "id": "high5216.txt"}
