That's true. One thing I still cannot  _ is the food and drink.\nAlmost every American person loves sodas, especially those full of ice cubes. I remember the first day I came to my host family. When I asked them for a glass of hot water, they all looked at me and thought I was crazy!\nAt my school there's no water dispenser   but there's one in each classroom in China. All the American students drink water from taps outside the restrooms that are specially designed for drinking. The water is cold and the school doesn't have hot water.\nThe most popular food here is hamburgers and French chips, which are junk food in China. Most students who eat at school prefer those to salads. They also eat lots of pizzas and hot dogs. As a result, you can always see some really fat people in school.\nLuckily, my host mom is really a great cook. She always makes food from different countries and eats a balanced meal every day. So I have a lot of fruit and vegetables. At my host family's home, they usually eat biscuits.\nThese old-fashioned biscuits are low in fat and flavored   with buttermilk, butter, and a bit of honey. Oh here comes the most interesting thing: the word \"biscuit\" in China actually means \"cracker  \" here. Real biscuits are a kind of soft cake.\nI was also amazed by the rich kinds of food in American supermarkets and their reasonable prices. For example, one brand of yogurt has 20 kinds of flavors! You're sure to find one that you like. And most of the food provides you \"light\", \"original\" or \"no sugar\" options to choose from.", "id": "high22444.txt"}
