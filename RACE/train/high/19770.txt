Applicants here have waited as long as 60 days to secure an appointment at one of five U.S. consular locations in China that process visas. There, they're often greeted by long lines, followed by a face-to-face interview that can end badly in a matter of seconds.\nNow there are only about 100 U.S. visa officers in China, facing considerable challenges during the summer when tourists and students travel the most. \"It's not easy work,\" Charles Bennett, minister-counselor for Consular Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said to his staff. \"You're making, in some cases, life-changing decisions many times a day, and that can cause great tiredness.\"\nTo adapt, US consular services expanded their hours, took on about a dozen additional staff and hope to have another 20 officers by spring. More facilities are also being expanded.\nDespite the shocking numbers, the embassy remains troubled by charges that it rejects applicants unreasonably and that the process is unfairly burdensome. \"I'm fed up,\" said Wendy Liu, 24. The single woman from Beijing said she was recently refused a visa and told to re-apply when her personal life and finances were more stable. \"I'll go anywhere but the U.S. now,\" she said. \"I thought America was supposed to be a country of freedom.\"\nTo visit the US, Chinese nationals must prove that they have enough money and family or business ties that make it likely they'll return to China. The Department of Homeland Security said it did not keep records on how many Chinese overstay their visas.\nStudent visas can be refused on grounds of national security. Beijing native Tan Ge, 25, believes he was not accepted after he stated his interests in infrared technology and nanoelectronics on his application. He now studies in Canada after being forced to abandon a full scholarship to Arizona State University.\nBy its very nature, the on-the-spot process at the U.S. Embassy can feel unbearable to Chinese applicants, who are asked to take their bank statements, property deeds , marriage licenses and HUKOU, a Chinese household ID.\n\"It made me feel very uncomfortable,\" said Xu Yong, 28, a journalist who needed a business visa last month to cover a conference in New York. \"They made me feel like someone from a Third World country up to no good.\"\nAfter giving his fingerprints, Xu waited to be called for his interview, sitting in an area that was as quiet as a library. Each passing minute seemed to be as long as a century.\nAfter an hour, Xu was called with three other people to a window for their interview. Two were rejected before his turn. Then the American officer, speaking fluent Chinese, reached for Xu's paperwork, asked some simple questions and said, \"Congratulations.\"\n\"I was so nervous. The first thing I did when I got out was to call my mom and tell her I passed,\" Xu said. \"She was the one who warned me it wasn't going to be easy.\"", "id": "high19770.txt"}
