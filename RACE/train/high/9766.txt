He should focus on this, at least until he is head-hunted to another company.\nThe Q80 Inspiration is a low and sexy four-door fastback, and it is also a showcase for technology - from autonomous driving to eco-friendly power trains. Here in Paris, the Infiniti people say the hybrid drive in this concept suggest exactly where the brand is going in the future.\nThe company says the Q80 speaks to how Infiniti plans to pull people into more expensive cars - cars that compete with the Porsche Panamera, for instance.\nAlfonso Albaisa, Infiniti Executive Design Director, said the car \"delivers feminine elegance and muscular menace in equal measure and strikes big in terms of styling, craftsmanship, choice of materials and attention to detail.\"\nMost importantly, for luxury cars buyers who are increasingly puzzled by all the technology, the designers focused on making things simple.\n\"There is a tendency with modern design that every time you add interior features and technology you add complexity,\" said Albaisa, pointing to the concept's easy-to -understand -and -operate infotainment interface.\nAs for power, the Q80 Inspiration gets 550 horsepower from a twin turbocharged 3.0-litre V-6 combined with a hybrid electric power train. Fuel economy could be as good as 5.5 litres/100 km.", "id": "high9766.txt"}
