When GM changed the name to Caribe,sales picked up dramatically.\nMarketing blunders have also been made by food and beverage companies. One  American food company's friendly \"Jolly Green Giant\" (for advertising vegetables)  became something quite different when it was translated into Arabic as \"Intimidating Green ogre \".\nWhen translated into German,Pepsi's popular slogan,\"Come Alive with Pepsi\" came out implying \"Come Alive from the Grave\".No wonder customers in prefix = st1 /Germanydidn't rush out to buy Pepsi.\nEven a company with an excellent international track record like Kentucky Fried Chicken is not immune to the perils of faulty translation.Many sales were lost when the catch phrase \"finger licking food\" became \"eat with your fingers off\" in Chinese translation.\nA manufacturer of one laundry detergent also made an expensive mistake in the Middle East. Its advertisements showed a picture of a pile of dirty clothes on the left, a box of the company's detergent in the middle, and clean clothes on the right.Unfortunately,the message was incorrectly interpreted because most people looked at it from right to left, the way Arabic is read.\nHaving awakened to the special nature of foreign advertising,companies are becoming much more conscientious in their translation and more sensitive to cultural distinctions.The best way to prevent errors is to hire professional translators who understand the target language and its idiomatic usage, or to use a technique called \"back translation\" to reduce the possibility of blunders. The process uses one person to translate a message into the target language and another to translate it back. Effective translators aim to capture the overall message of an advertisement because a word-for-word duplication of the original rarely conveys the intended meaning and often causes misunderstandings.", "id": "high22258.txt"}
