Everyday when she came home from work, she told her husband how terrible her day had been, how tiring the work and how unreasonable her boss. \"Leave that job,\" her husband told her.\n\"Oh, I will,\" she said. \"But not yet. I have too many friends there for me to leave.\" And so she remained unhappy at work until the years became decades and her children had children. \"Leave that job,\" her grandchildren told her. \"Oh, I will,\" she said. \"But not yet. There are only seven more years until I reach thirty years of service and can retire. So I can't just yet.\"\nI know this woman. And her story reminds me of an old dog half asleep on the porch of a general store, moaning and groaning in the sun. \"Why is your dog acting that way?\" a customer asked the store owner. \"Oh,\" answered the man. \"He's lying on a nail.\" \"Well, why doesn't he move?\" \"Because it's not hurting him bad enough.\"\nThat's true for people, too. We convince ourselves the pain is not bad enough to leave the workplace we know. But we're wrong. _ work pain is continuing. Some work pain damages our self-esteem, kills our passion or destroys our dreams.\nWilbur Wright once commented, \"We could hardly wait to get up in the morning. I know that exhilarating feeling of being so passionate about something I was working on that I couldn't wait to get back to work. And people who are winning at working know that kind of passion, too.\"\nThey get excited about work. They offer their unique gifts and talents eagerly. And when things don't change as they sometimes will, they refuse to let environment hijack  their self-esteem, passion or dreams.", "id": "high889.txt"}
