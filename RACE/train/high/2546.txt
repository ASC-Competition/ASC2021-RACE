Roger started out as an unpaid worker in a small flower shop. He has become the owner of a florist company whose sales are well over $100 000 a year.\nOne day when Roger was only twelve, he stopped at a local flower shop. He asked the owner if he could work for him, without pay, in order to learn the business. Roger started working every day after school and on weekends. After two years on the job, he finally asked for a small salary. The owners told him he \"wasn't good enough to be paid.\" So he quit, and found a paying job at another local flower shop. He worked hard there, but after six months they _ because business was slow.\nNot discouraged, Roger decided to do it alone and started his own flower store in a basement in his town. He started his business with only sixty-five dollars. He bought old refrigerators at garage sales and knocked the shelves out. This turned them into coolers for his fresh-cut flowers. His business grew rapidly as he built up a reputation for top quality and fine service.\nIn 1977, Roger bought out the flower store where he had worked without pay for over two years. The people who said he \"wasn't good enough to be paid\" were astonished to find that they were being taken over by a teenager. He had plans to renovate   the whole store.\nOne of the reasons the owners sold out to Roger was that the store wasn't doing well. But after Roger took over ownership and redid the store, business started booming. In fact, business was so good that after one year, he celebrated by buying out the other store where he had worked. Roger then combined both stores and moved to a location in the center of his town.\nThe new store has 2 000 square feet and seven employees. And he did it all before he reached the age of twenty.", "id": "high2546.txt"}
