After all, people like gossip and interesting bits of information: you only have to look at the number of celebrity-focused publications to realize that we have a huge appetite for discussing other people's lives. At work, however, this type of interaction is harmful and costly. It wastes time, damages reputations, promotes divisiveness , creates anxiety.\nRumors often grow because people like to be \"in the know.\" Knowledge is power, and that's why the people with the least amount of power in an organization can often be the ones to start and spread rumors. It can make them feel important if they're seen to know things that others don't.\nThis knowledge is at the center of why and how rumors start and spread. Insufficient  knowledge or incomplete information are often to blame. Consider these examples:\n*People don't know why a colleague was fired, so they make up a reason based on some limited knowledge or insignificant fact. \"I saw John override  the cash register the other day without a supervisor present. Maybe he stole some money and that's why he went.\"\n*People see a pattern of behavior between two individuals and they add their own explanation. \"Joseph and Samantha spend a lot of time together after hours 'catching up on paperwork.' And just yesterday, they were sitting awfully close to each other in the meeting. I bet paperwork isn't all that's getting done after work!\"\nThese rumors are typical of the things you'll face at work, and they spread because of a lack of accurate information. So, the best way to fight rumors is with good communication. When you communicate well, your team knows what's happening, and they trust that you'll keep them informed. Good communication within your team also means that you will become aware of any rumors that are starting, and you'll be able to address them quickly and effectively.", "id": "high7225.txt"}
