People and buildings along the coast are at risk of flooding and other environmental disasters,\" said Seto.\nThe study provides the first estimate of how fast urban areas globally are growing and how fast they may grow in the future. \"We know a lot about global patterns of urban population growth, but we know significantly less about how urban areas are changing,\" she said. \"Changes in land cover associated with urbanization lead to many environmental changes, from habitats loss and agricultural land conversion  to changes in local and regional climate.\"\nThe researchers examined studies that used satellite data to map urban growth and found that from 1970 to 2000 the world's urban footprint had grown by at least 22,400 square miles--half the size of Ohio.\n\"This number is numerous, but, in actuality, urban land expansion has been far greater than what our analysis shows because we only looked at the published studies that used satellite data,\" said Seto. \"We found that 48 of the most populated urban areas have been studied using satellite data, with findings in journals. This means that we're not tracking the physical expansion of more than half of the world's largest cities.\"\nHalf of urban land expansion in China is driven by a rising middle class, whereas the size of cities in India and Africa is driven primarily by population growth. \"Rising incomes translate into rising demand for bigger homes and more land for urban development, which has a great effect on biodiversity conservations, loss of carbon sinks and energy use.\"", "id": "high3579.txt"}
