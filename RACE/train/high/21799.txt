In the fanfily\ntraditional cultural patterns confer (~z~,) leadership on one or both of the parents. In other\ncases, such as friendship groups, one or more persons may gradually emerge as leaders,\nalthough there is no formal process of selection. In larger groups, leaders are usually chosen\nformally through election or recruitment.\nAlthough leaders are often thought to be people with unusual personal ability, decades of\nresearch have failed to produce consistent evidence that there is any category of \"natural\nleaders.\" It seems that there is no set of personal qualities that all leaders have in common;\nrather, virtually any person may be recognized as a leader if the person has qualities that meet\nthe needs of that particular group.\nFurthermore, although it is commonly supposed that social groups have a single leader,\nresearch suggests that there are typically two different leadership roles that are held by\ndifferent individuals. Instrumental leadership is leadership that emphasizes the completion of\ntasks by a social group. Group members look to instrumental leaders to \"get things done.\"\nExpressive leadership, on the other hand, is leadership that emphasizes the collective\nwell-beings of a social group's members. Expressive leaders are less concerned with the\noverall goals of the group than with providing emotional support to group members and\nattempting to minimize tension and conflict among them. Group members expect expressive\nleaders to maintain stable relationships within the group and provide support to individual\nmembers.\nInstrumental leaders are likely to have a rather  _ to other group\nmembers. They give orders and may discipline group members who prohibit attainment  \nof the group's goals. Expressive leaders cultivate a more personal or primary relationship to\nothers in the group. They offer sympathy when someone experiences difficulties or is\nsubjected to discipline, are quick to lighten a serious moment with humor, and try to resolve\nissues that threaten to divide the group. As the difference in these two roles suggests,\nexpressive leaders generally receive more personal affection from group members;\ninstrumental leaders, if they are successful in promoting group goals, may enjoy a more\ndistant respect.", "id": "high21799.txt"}
