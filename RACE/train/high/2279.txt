A chowder is a kind of soup. I was laughed at because of my last name as soon as I started school. So when my family moved to South Carolina, I asked my dad if I could change my name.\n\"You shouldn't change who you are. Let people get to know you first and your name later. When you meet someone new, ask them a good question, something you're really interested in. Once people start talking about themselves, they don't judge  you.\"\nTwo days later I headed to my new school for the first day of class. At lunch, I noticed that there were twin brothers who were talking to each other. I remembered my dad's advice, so I decided to try.\nI noticed that their lunchboxes were _ \"What's it like being a twin?\" I asked.\nThey looked surprised. Then one said, \"No one has ever asked us that!\"\n\"Most of the time it's good,\" the other said. \"When you're a twin you always have someone to talk to and have lunch with.\"\nIn no time we were laughing and talking. Then one of the brothers said, \"I'm Nicholas, and this is my brother, Nathaniel. What's your name?\"\nI took a deep breath and said, \"I'm Chelsea Chowderhead.\"\n\"Chowder? Like the soup?\" asked Nathaniel.\n\"Yes,\" I replied, looking down.\n\"Hey, cool! Do you want to come over after school and play basketball with us?\" Nathaniel asked. I nodded.\nAnd that is how I became friends with the twin brothers.", "id": "high2279.txt"}
