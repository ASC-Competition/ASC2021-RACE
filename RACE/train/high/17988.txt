A waterfall at a river near his childhood home in Vietnam created hundreds of tiny bubbles. \"I saw another world in bubbles, and I imagined how nice it would be if I could create a big bubble and be inside it,\" he says.\n    Many years later, Fan realized that dream. He has formed bubbles around hundreds of people, made large bubbles that his daughter can walk through, and even made square bubbles. Fan calls himself a \"bubble artist\" and \"bubble scientist.\" \"So far, I haven't met any other bubble scientist!\" he says.\n    To achieve what he wanted, Fan worked hard for years. \"After many years of failure, I finally came out with a bubble solution that made big bubbles with beautiful color1s.\" Five years later, after lots of more practice and experiments, he created the world's largest bubble which was 156 feet long.\n    Fan designed a program called the Gazillion Bubble Show. He has many performance tips to offer. He says it's good to make the audience feel tension   so that they are surprised at the end of a trick. He also suggests doing performances that are fun to watch, so that the audience will stay interested the whole time\n    To perform his tricks, Fan uses bubbles equipment that he created himself. He wants to know that they're not limited by anything except their imaginations, and they can create whatever they want to help them follow their interests.\n    \"To make art, you need time, love and hard work, which guided my life and made me successful. I am proud to say that I used something simple--- bubbles---and brought it to a completely new world.\"", "id": "high17988.txt"}
