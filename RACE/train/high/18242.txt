Bassett answers, \"No. When you lost a leg, it teaches you to appreciate little things - like being able to walk and run.\"\n     Born in England, Bassett was left at an orphanage  due to terrible burns. Her right leg was cut off above the knee. She felt hungry all the time. When she was old enough to get around, she was forced to clean floors, feed babies and wash dishes. And she had to do all that with an artificial   leg that didn't work well.\n     When she was 7, a family in Michigan adopted her, giving her an improved artificial leg. It was OK for everyday activities, but she couldn't play soccer or basketball.\n     When she was 14, she got a high-tech leg made for sports. \"I remember being terrified because that was my first time,\" she said. Scout Bassett was waiting nervously for the race to start when the athlete Sarah Reinertsen came up and said, \"I've been doing this for a while. Let me help you.\"\n    Reinertsen, who lost her leg when she was 7, works with an organization called the Challenged Athletes Foundation to help people like Scout Bassett. She lost that first race, but  gained confidence from Reinertsen. Training hard, she improved her strength and skill. She even took up golf and tennis.\n     Now, living in Califomia, Bassett runs competitively and finds time to share her story with school groups. She said, \"Some people think they having nothing in common with me. I want to say everyone has challenges - maybe with homework or friends. No matter what it is, everything you need is inside your heart. Take small steps and you will reach your dream.\"", "id": "high18242.txt"}
