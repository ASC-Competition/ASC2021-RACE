Young people of our two countries should help this relationship grow.'\nThis remark   was made by a Shanghai student when speaking to his fellow students at the Nixon Library in California, U.S.A. He was one of 80 middle school students from China attending a month-long 'Youth Summit'. The Summit was to mark the 25th anniversary   of President Nixon's journey to China, which was the turning point in China-U.S. relations.\nThe Youth Summit was aimed at increasing understanding and friendship between young students of the two countries through visits and discussions. Seventy-five American students were selected to visit China. They also visited the Nixon Library on July 21 before leaving for Beijing the next day. The head of the Library said he was pleased to see the American and Chinese students talking and laughing together.\nOne Chinese student said, 'I didn't find it particularly difficult to talk with Americans. We have our differences, but we have a lot in common. Dialogue is good for us.'", "id": "high9487.txt"}
