How about falling off it laughing? If so, \"Rush Hour 1\" is the perfect movie for you. Although it didn't get the best reviews, it is perfect for those who like a good comedy.\nJust as in the first \"Rush Hour,\" Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and LAPD Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) are partners. This time, they are on vacation in China and Carter is looking for a good time, but they are on the job again when a bombing at the American Embassy kills two customs agents. Lee and Carter go to look for a suspect named Ricky Tan. For Lee this is a serious case because Tan killed his father. Will Carter and Lee be able to capture Tan?\nAnother reason to see this movie perhaps is for the thrilling action, which includes karate fights with Jackie Chan. One of my favorite scenes shows Carter and Lee in a massage parlor   when everything goes crazy.\n\"Rush Hour 2\" is, of course, really funny with Chris Tucker in the lead role. Chan and Tucker have many clever jokes and remarks. Some of the jokes aren't enjoyed by the critics, but most will find them entertaining.\nWith no doubt, the movie was great. I was filled with anxiety about what was going to happen next. Many critics say that sequels   are not as good as the original but this one is great. I especially enjoyed it because the special effects are minimal so everything looks as though it actually happened. The lighting effect is great as well as the sound.\nSo, if you are looking for a great action movie that leaves you at the edge of your seat and makes you laugh quite a bit, you should rush to see \"Rush Hour 2.\"", "id": "high3202.txt"}
