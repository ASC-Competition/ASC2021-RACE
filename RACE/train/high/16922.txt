IRC is Internet Relay Chat. It is a group of networked server computers that let users connect and pass their messages among the networked servers in almost real time. In other words, it is a big chatting server, once you join a group, you are able to talk in an open forum  type environment or just one on one.\n  What IRC Networks are out there? There are about fifty really mainstream IRC networks (groups of servers) you can connect to. The most common ones found are typically, 'EF-Net', 'Under-Net', and 'DAL-Net'.\n  What is a Channel? A channel is the name for the 'group' you are joining, or the 'forum' in which you want to talk. On IRC, channels are denoted   as # Channel Name. For instance, say if you are interested in MP3 music, you may want to go to # MP3.\n  How do I get on IRC? To get on IRC, you will need to get a client program. I personally suggest using 'mIRC', if you are in the windows environment. I have used the program for many years faithfully. It is a shareware program that doesn't disable after a given time period.\n  What are the basic commands once I am on? Join # channel -- this will make you enter a channel. Part # channel -- this will make you exit a channel you are in. Nick new name -- this will change your current screen name.\nA note as a warning about IRC. IRC is a wonderful forum for idea exchange, and a fun place to chat and learn. However you must keep in mind that you don't know who is on the other end. That someone says they are 16 doesn't mean they aren't 45. Keep an eye on yourself and make sure not to give out any personal information on IRC before you know those on the other end of the line thoroughly. Attention! Safe IRCing everyone!", "id": "high16922.txt"}
