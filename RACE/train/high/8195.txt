I was short and fat, which was bad for a girl, so coordination was not one of my strongest features. On the other hand, my mother was a very talented\nsoftball player who even acted as my coach. Night after night, I would try my best to impress \"my coach\".Unfortunately, I just felt like a terrible disappointment to my mother.\nOne summer afternoon, my mother told us we were going to visit Uncle David. Since we lived in an apartment, going to the country was quite a treat. My uncle David always had a way of making me feel special.\nWhen we arrived, my uncle and cousin Jeff were throwing metal rings at two holes in the ground. I was curious about what they were doing so I went over to watch. Noticing that I was standing there, my uncle asked if I had ever played washers.\nBeing a \"city girl\", my reply was that the only \"washers\" I knew were the ones that cleaned clothes. To my embarrassment, Uncle David, chuckling ,explained that the metal rings were called washers. I was shocked to hear my uncle saying he wanted me to take his place. He then gave me the washers and gave tips on how to throw better.\nUnwillingly, I joined Jeff. Gradually, I found myself not only enjoying but also wanting to win this game. The washer went into the air and began to fall. Then a cloud of dust appeared as the washer sank into the hole. My first try! I had actually thrown the washer into the hole!\nAlthough 23 summers have gone by since that day, this small success in washer playing helped me get back self confidence lost when I struggled with the game of softball.", "id": "high8195.txt"}
