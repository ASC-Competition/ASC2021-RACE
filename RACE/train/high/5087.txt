In his first novel, A Wind In Montana, Mitch Davies tells a story about young adults and how they accept responsibility for their lives.\nA Wind in Montana is a great tale of two teenagers, Rory Coleman and Victoria Beach, high school students at the same school, who struggle to make the right decision for themselves. As each of them nears adulthood, they become more concerned with the future and set goals that will bring them happiness and a sense of achievement.\nWithout any advice from his parents, Rory chooses to pursue   a profession in chemistry, applies for a chemistry scholarship, and determines to do everything he can to achieve it. Along the path, Rory finds that even though he has a plan, there are obstacles   that could prevent him from realizing his goals. Victoria's struggles are different from Rory's. Although her father has decided that she should become a professional musician, Victoria has other plans for her life. Together, Rory and Victoria attempt to follow their dreams, despite the obstacles in their paths. A Wind In Montana contains a lesson for all teens about to enter adulthood -- that disappointment and setbacks   are going to occur no matter how determined they are and that they need to develop skills along the way that will help them deal with them effectively.\nMitch Davies' book stands out among today's teen books that deal with imaginary situations. A Wind In Montana is a real story about real people facing real-life situations. It's entertaining and also helps readers think about their own lives and offers various ways to handle situations that may arise.", "id": "high5087.txt"}
