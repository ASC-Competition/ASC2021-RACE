There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists.\nMy story begins when I was in New York City for a speech, and my wife took a picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of the 57thand 5thavenue. We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.\nWell you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, \"Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ceremony?\" This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture.\nSo these photos are far more than representatives for a single moment, or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year, and nor just physically, but in every way. Because while we take the same photo, our viewpoints change, and she reaches new milestones and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she communicates with and sees everything. This very focused time we get to spend together is something we value and expect the entire year.", "id": "high11999.txt"}
