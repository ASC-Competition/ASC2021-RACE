The goal of their game was to write the word \"shmily\" in a surprise place for the other to find. They took turns leaving \"shmily\" around the house, and as soon as one of them discovered it, it was their turn to hide it once more. They dragged \"shmily\" with their fingers through the sugar and flour containers to await whoever was preparing the next meal. \"Shmily\" was written in the steam left on the mirror after a hot shower, where it would reappear bath after bath. There was no end to the places where \"shmily\" would _ . Little notes with \"shmily\" were found on car seats, or taped to steering wheels. The notes were put inside shoes and left under pillows. \"Shmily\" was written in the dust upon the mantel and traced in the ashes of the fireplace. This mysterious word was as much a part of my grandparents' house as the furniture.\nIt took me a long time before I was able to fully appreciate my grandparents' game. Skepticism has kept me from believing in true love --- one that is pure and enduring  . However, I never doubted my grandparents' relationship. It was based on passionate affection which not everyone is lucky enough to experience.\nBut there was a dark cloud in my grandparents' life: my grandmother had breast cancer. The disease had first appeared ten years earlier. As always, Grandpa was with her every step of the way. He comforted her in their yellow room, painted that way so that she could always be surrounded by sunshine, even when she was too sick to go outside. But my grandmother grew steadily weaker until, finally, she could not leave the house anymore. Then one day, what we all dreaded finally happened. Grandma was gone.\n\"Shmily.\" It was written in yellow on the pink ribbons of my grandmother's funeral bouquet  . As the crowd thinned and the last mourners turned to leave, Grandpa stepped up to my grandmother's coffin and, taking a shaky breath, he began to sing to her. Through his tears and grief, the song came: S-h-m-i-l-y: See How Much I Love You.", "id": "high4560.txt"}
