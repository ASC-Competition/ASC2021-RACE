His boss had spoken rudely, \"Your services are no longer needed.\" Nate left the building filled with despair . By the time he reached home, he was in a deep depression. When he entered his house, he blurted  out to his wife Sophia, \"I lost my job. I am a complete, utter failure.\" A tense silence  followed. Then a smile crept  across Sophia's face. \"What great news!\" she responded. \"Now you can write the book you have always wanted to write.\"\"But I have no job and no prospect (hope) of a job,\" he objected  , completely without hope . \"If I struggle to be an author, then what will we live on? Where will the money come from?\" Sophia took her husband by the hand and led him to the kitchen, opening a drawer; she took out a box that was full of cash . \"Where on earth did you get this?\" Nate gasped. \"To whom does it belong?\"\n\"It's ours!\" Sophia replied . \"I always knew that one day you would become a great writer if only you were given the chance. From the money you gave me for housekeeping every week, I have saved as much as I could so you would have your chance. Now there is enough to last us a whole year.\"\nWhat a surprise! What encouragement! What a wife! The unemployed  husband did concentrate on writing that year, and the novel he wrote became a literary masterpiece . The book is The Scarlet Letter. Sophia had an even greater achievement, and she turned Nathaniel Hawthorne from a poor clerk  into a world famous master.", "id": "high16865.txt"}
