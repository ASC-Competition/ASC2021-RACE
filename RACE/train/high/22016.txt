In fact almost three-quarters of them report a modest to more than average sense of job satisfaction and a little more than ten percent say they are \"very satisfied\" with their work. So why then does an overwhelming majority of this contented group also report that they are considering changing jobs?\nThe easy and most popular theory says that it's all about the money. IT professionals with highly-prized skills in a very tight job market play salary-stick-em-up by raising their salary demands with each job hop. But this theory calls for a closer look. According to a recent Gartner Group IT market study, enterprises that are experiencing high rates of turnover on average actually offer higher salaries. The Gartner study cites \"lack of career development opportunities\" as the single most reported reason employees leave companies.\nMark Pecoraro, president and CEOof SuccessFactors.com, a workforce management firm, tends to agree: \"One of the things we see is the strong desire of these professionals to keep on the cutting edge. These employees are taking control of building their knowledge toolsets and essentially writing their own career tickets.\"\n\"INDUS Corporation, a Washington, D.C.-based IT firm, is a wonderful place to work,\" says SearchWin2000 salary survey respondent James Voorhees. Voorhees got his start in IT as an INDUS technical writer. Now, he works as a network administrator, crediting his employer for creating a work environment that let him develop the skills he needed in order to change careers. \n\"An important part of the company culture is an emphasis on employee satisfaction,\" Voorhees says, pointing to \"the company's willingness to let employees try new things ... which has given me several great opportunities to learn and gain experience in networking and software engineering.\"\nBut INDUS' success relies on a steady series of contract work. Voorhees believes that his status as an IT newbie  makes him at risk if these contracts should dry up. As a result he has adopted a mindset that is ready to seize an outside opportunity if it should present itself.", "id": "high22016.txt"}
