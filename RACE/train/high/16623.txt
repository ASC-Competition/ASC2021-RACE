But new data suggest that school soft drink sales may not be an important factor in how much soda kids drink.\nIn the current issue of The Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, researchers compared soda consumption among nearly 500 students inprefix = st1 /Mainewho attended seven schools over two school years. Four of the schools cut back on soft drink availability at the schools, while three of the schools made no changes.\nAll the students were drinking less soda by the end of the study period, but there were no meaningful differences in overall soft drink consumption among the different schools. The data suggest that limiting soft drink availability at school doesn't result in meaningful changes in drink consumption patterns. While there were no changes in overall soda consumption, there was a notable shift in diet soda drinking among girls. If the school cut back on soda availability, girls were less likely to drink diet soda, compared to girls in schools that made no changes.\nThe data are the latest to suggest that schools may not play as big of a role in kids' poor eating habits as widely believed. Last year, The American Journal of Public Healthpublished a provocative   study showing that childhood weight problems often get worse in the summer, when kids are out of school.\nData from kindergarteners and first graders found that body mass index   increased two to three times as fast in summer as during the regular school year. Minority children were especially at risk, as were children who were already overweight.\nEven children who were too thin and needed to gain weight appeared to have better eating habits during the school year. They actually gained more weight while in school and less in the summer.\nEven so, much of the focus on childhood nutrition and obesity   remains in the nation's schools. Today, The Timesreported that even the school bake sale is disappearing as districts impose strict standards on the food served on school grounds.", "id": "high16623.txt"}
