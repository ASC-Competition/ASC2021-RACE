How fair will that be? Well, it happens every day to high schoolers. Just because some students have stolen things in shops, all of us are treated like _ Even though I'd never steal, store employees looked at me like I'm some kind of hardened criminal mastermind.\nFor example, during one lunch period, my friend Denny and I went to the Grab \"n\" Go on Tuesday. We arrived to find a line of students waiting outside. A new sign in the window told the story:\" NO MORE THAN TWO STUDENTS AT A TIME.\" After 15 minutes, we finally got in. But the store manger laid the evil eye on us. I asked him about the new sign, and he said, \"You kids are lifting too much stuff.\" You kids? Too much stuff? Not only were we considered to be shoplifters, but brilliant, greedy shoplifters.\nThe Grab \"n\" Go isn't an isolated case. Earlier this year, a department store worker told me to leave my backpack at the front of the store. When I asked who was going to keep an eye on my stuff, she said, \"Don't worry. It isn't going anywhere.\" In other words, I had to risk losing my stuff so that the store wouldn't have to risk losing theirs. \"Don't worry,\" I replied, \"I don't need to shop here.\"\nThe most annoying thing, though, is the way employees watch my friends and me. It's almost strange and frightening. Once, at a drug store, I went down an aisle and found a guy standing on a box, stocking the shelves. He was watching my hands, which were empty. He got down off his box and rushed off, as if he was going to get the store manger. How crazy is that?\nYou know, _ . I work at the CD Crib, and every day I see adults commit a terrible crime. They put on a set of headphones and sort of dance to the music. Talk about bad! Tomorrow, I'm going to put a sign in the window: \" NO MORE THAN TWO ADULTS LISTNENING TO MUSIC AT A TIME.\"", "id": "high7265.txt"}
