But she was then informed that her results were undergoing routine checks. Soon after that, she received an e-mail telling her that\"a decision has been made to withhold this result permanently\"and stating that Wang had\"breached  IELTS test rules and regulations\".\nA number of students who took the test during the past two months in cities including Nanjing, Changsha and Guangzhou, have had the same experience. Many test takers said they were confused because they didn't know how they had breached the rules and regulations.\nIELTS authorities said in an e-mail toChinaDailythat IELTS takes the responsibility of providing test results very seriously. Results are only withheld in cases where there is strong evidence to suggest that the candidates have not observed IELTS regulations.\"In these cases, we are unable to guarantee that their result is a true reflection of their English language skills,\"they said in the e-mail, although they gave no figures of how many students were involved.\"We regret any inconvenience this may cause, but these measures are essential to protect the value of the results for more than 2.5 million test takers every year. Hundreds of thousands of people take IELTS in China every year and the number of results which are permanently withheld is a tiny proportion ,\"they said.\nHu Min, president ofNew Channel International Education Group, an English-language tutorial agency in China, said a major cause of results being withheld might be an extreme imbalance in performance levels in the four sections of the test.\"For example, if a student scores very high in the reading and listening sections while performing poorly in writing and speaking, IELTS authorities may suspect that the test taker has memorized the reading and listening questions -- a practice that is very popular among Chinese test takers,\"he said.\"IELTS authorities discourage such a practice and would determine that the scores can't reflect the real English level if test takers do so.\"", "id": "high19530.txt"}
