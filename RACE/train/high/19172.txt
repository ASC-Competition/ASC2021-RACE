Basically how you would like a true real friend to be,you should be like this to your true friends. Trust and forgiveness are some ingredients of a true friend. True friendships are hard to come by. And what's more,life is short. So treasure these friends if you have already had them. If you don't continue to search,because once you have them,life becomes so much easier to live,no matter what happens. I have been through pretty rough patches and I dare say,without my friends I would not have made it.\nFriendships need lots of energy and patience to maintain  them. Not to mention time too. When your friend needs you,sometimes when things are not going too well on your side,it is often so easy to turn a deaf ear to their pleas. It is especially during these times,that you must find the strength in you to help your friend. And it is during these times that your friendship will be forged  and made stronger.\nAnd you must always be happy for their successes,even when things are not going too well on your side. It might be hard to do for some people but it is something that you need to learn. Think about all the sacrifices your friend has made for you and all the times when he or she was happy for you despite his or her own troubles.\nRemember,true _ friends _ are _ the _ next _ best _ thing _ to _ family. They will always be your pillar of support no matter what happens. Always.", "id": "high19172.txt"}
