Moving is one of the most stress-producing events a family has to go through. Experts say it can be harder for children. How do you help your child adjust to the changes?\nThe Ricardos moved from their old house to a new home. Same family, same dog-but it was harder for 9-year-old Elena. She hated the room, the house and everything. She hated leaving her friends the most.\n\" I was so emotional. I mean, saying goodbye to all my friends.....my very close friends, who was my neighbor, made me so sad,\" says Elena.\nFor some children, the emotional stress of moving is not much more different from the emotions when someone has died.\n\"There's that sense that, 'I've lost my friends, my friends, my base, my school, my teachers-everything I knew that made me feel safe is all gone now.
