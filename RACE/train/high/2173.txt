He liked reading when he studied at school. He thought the writers were respected and could get a lot of money. He wrote a lot of stories and posted them to the editorial departments but didn't receive any answers.\nNow he works in a factory. He's busy at work. When he's free, he always reads something. He always remembers he hoped to be a writer when he was young. One day, Xiao Ping, his ten-year-old daughter, came back. She looked worried and didn't eat anything. She said Miss GAO, her Chinese teacher, told them to write a solicit article \"My Father\" that evening. But she did not know what to write.\n\"That's easy,\" said Lao Yang. \"Let me help you.\"\nThen he sat down to write the solicit article at once. He easily finished it on time. He was sure Miss GAO would like it. But one afternoon he asked his daughter if the article had been chosen to post to the editorial department.\n\"My teacher said your article digressed from the subject,\" said the girl.\n\"I don't think so,\" Lao Yang shouted angrily. \"I described just my father!\"", "id": "high2173.txt"}
