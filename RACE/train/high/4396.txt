If two are heading the same way for a while, the vehicles connect, with one car's rear  wheels matching up with the front wheels of another car.Up to 10@Ants can be put together and will automatically connect to form a\"train\".This  will help save energy while traveling, as well reducing traffic jams.\nThe car sounds like a great idea.Further research will be needed to turn this concept  car into something for the market,but concepts like Cherry's  show how carmakers are  working for cleaner and greener vehicles.It's like what the@Ant motto says,\"Exploring future human beings'lifestyles\".", "id": "high4396.txt"}
