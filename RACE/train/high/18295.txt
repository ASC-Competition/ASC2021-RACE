Others have told pupils to leave them at home. However, Dr Elizabeth Hartnell-Young at the University of Nottingham believes it is time that phone bans were reassessed--because mobile phones can be a powerful learning aid, they say.\n\"At the start of the study, even pupils were often surprised at the thought that mobile phones could be used for learning,\" Dr Hartnell-Young says. \"After their hands-on experience, almost all pupils said they had enjoyed the project and felt more motivated. \"Some teachers also had to reassess their views. \"Using this technology gives them more freedom to express themselves without needing to be constantly governed.\" one said.\nOther teachers found that pupils who lacked confidence gained most from the project. However, they recognized that greater use of mobile phones in schools could prove troublesome. Increased temptation to steal phones was one worry. \"I thought, well, four of these smart phones are going to end up on e-BAY tomorrow,\" one teacher said. A few teachers remained concerned that phones could prove a distraction for some pupils. Allowing pupils to access school emails via mobiles would also bring risks if passwords were shared, they said.\nDr Hartnell-Young says that the teachers' worries are understandable. \"While the eventual aim should be to cancel overall bans on phones we do not recommend immediate, whole-school change,\" she said. \"Instead we believe that teachers, students and the wider community should work together to develop policies that will enable this powerful new learning tool to be used safely.  We hope that, in future, mobile phone use will be as natural as using any other technology in school.\"", "id": "high18295.txt"}
