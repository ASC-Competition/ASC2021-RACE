It is good for you!\" You've probably heard that many times, and it is true. Milk contains calcium, which is a necessary nutrient for keeping bones and teeth healthy and strong. The US government even requires milk as part of the National School Lunch Program, saying that students should drink one cup of fat-free milk at each meal.\nLast Thursday, however, a group of doctors asked the government to remove the lunch program. The Physical Committee for Responsible Medicine says, \"Milk is high in sugar, high in fat and high in animal protein,\" all of which have negative effects on health. The PCRM says there were better and healthier ways to get calcium such as eating beans, broccoli, cereals and tofu. Orange juice and soymilk that have calcium added to them also supply the nutrient. \"One of the only reasons people talk about dairy, or promote it at all, is because it is going to help build strong bones.\" says Dr. Neal Bamard, president of the PCRM. But milk may not be the best way to get calcium your body needs.\nOf course, calcium is important for health bones and teeth, but there are other things that affect your bone strength, such as genes, how much vitamin D you take in and getting an hour's worth of exercise every day.\nSome nutritionists disagree with the idea that milk isn't important. Keri Gans, a dietitian, says, \"I think it is irresponsible to take this beverage that children enjoy, especially among those who are unable to meet their nutrient needs for the day, and remove it from lunch time.\"\nThe US government is studying the request of the PCRM, but a decision may be a one way to take off. Meanwhile, Marion Nestle, a professor at New York University, put it best: \"Milk demonstrably has nutrients. Other foods have the same nutrients. It's just a food. Like other foods, too much might be a problem. \"", "id": "high17752.txt"}
