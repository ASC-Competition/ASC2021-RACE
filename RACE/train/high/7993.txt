Many educators today are looking for evidence to support the case for homework, but are coming up empty-handed.\nMary Jane Cera is the academic administrator for the Kino School, and she maintains a no-homework policy across all grades. The purpose of the policy is to make sure learning remains a joy, not a thing that discourages social time and creative activity.\nAt the Kino school, Cera says children often choose to take their favorite parts of school home. \"A lot of what we see kids doing is practicing music with their friends, and taking experiments home to show their parents,\" she says. Surveys of Kino graduates suggest that the early control they are given over their education continues to serve them well into college.\n\"One of the reasons that we continue to assign much homework is our obsession   with tests, although we can agree on the importance of kids doing better on tests through proper homework to some degree,\"says author Alfie Kohn. In his book The Homework Myth, Kohn points out that no study has ever found a relation between homework and academic achievement and that if kids have no choice in the matter of homework, they're not really exercising judgment, and are instead losing their sense of self-control.\nHowever, many supporters of homework argue that life is filled with things we don't like to do, and that homework teaches self-discipline, time management and other non-academic life skills.\nWherever the homework debate goes next, it's worth taking a moment to examine if we're doing the right thing about our children's education. The good news is -- it's never too late to start.", "id": "high7993.txt"}
