The population in Africa  as in other parts of the world, is getting older. Currently, there are 36 million people on the continent 65 years and above. which is 3.6 percent of the population. up from 3.3 percent 10 years ago. That could rise to 4.5 percent by 2030 and 10 percent by 2050. The African development Bank is raising concerns over the shortage of health insurance and pensions  .\nThe African Development Bank says. \"Aging is highly linked with long-term physical and mental  disability and a number of long-term chronic   conditions.\"\n\"Africa is not well prepared to care for its aging population right now. And it needs to prepare for this fact.\" said Professor Mthuli Ncube. the African Development Bank's chief economist. African nations spend far less on healthcare than developed nations do _  about $26per person per year. Not so many countries have well developed medical aid plans for the elderly, whether they are privately provided plans or indeed government plans. If you look at the pension plans, you will find the pension industries are not well developed in some of the countries.\nProfessor Mthuli Ncube said African governments failed to take action on health insurance\nand pensions because they were busy with economic reforms.\nAnother challenge for Africa is the worsening of informal systems of social protection. That is cash and support from both the extended family and community sources.\n. The African Development Bank recommends governments help carry out health insurance and pension plans. Ncube said African governments didn't have to handle the health insurance burden alone. \"It is not only a must but also an opportunity for private companies to add their bit in this regard\", he said. The report also recommends that African governments consider providing ways of free health services. medications and long-term health care facilities for the elderly.", "id": "high5151.txt"}
