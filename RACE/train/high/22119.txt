And in a strange way, I expect that you will find your father is there too , in you mind and in your heart .I find that my parents , long dead now , still figure in many of my dreams and that I think of them perhaps more than I ever did when they were alive . I still live to please them and I'm still surprised by their reactions.I remember that when I became a professor, I was so proud,or rather so pleased with myself ,that I couldn't wait to cable my parents . The reply was a long time in coming , but when it did , all Mother said was\"I hope this means that now you will have more time for the children!\" I haven't forgotten .The values of my parents still live on .\nIt makes me pause and think about how I will live on in the hearts and minds of my children and of those for whom I care .Would I have been as ready as Philip Lawrence have been to face the aggressors  , and to lay down my life for those in my care ? How many people would want me back for Christmas ? It's a serious thought , one to give me pause .\nI pray silently , something , in the dead of night , that ancient cry of a poet \" _ ), and my darling form the power of the dog .\"Yet I know that death comes to us all , and sometimes comes suddenly. We must therefore plan not to live forever , but live as if we will die tomorrow. We live on, I'm sure, in the lives of those we loved , and therefore we ought to have to care for what they will remember and what they will treasure . If more parents knew this in their hearts to be true , there might be fewer knives on our streets today .", "id": "high22119.txt"}
