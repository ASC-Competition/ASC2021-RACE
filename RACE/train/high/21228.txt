Getting into Columbia is a real testament of what a great well-rounded student you are. You should be as proud of yourself as we are.\nYour college years will be the most important of your life. It is in college that you will discover what learning is about. This will be the period where you go from teacher-taught to master-inspired, after which you must become self-learner. So do take each subject seriously, and even if what you learn isn't critical for your life, the learning skills you acquire will be something you will cherish forever.\nFollow your passion in college. Take courses you think you will enjoy. Don't be trapped by what others think or say, but make up your own mind.\nMost importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life. Pick a few friends and become really close to them - pick the ones who are genuine to you. Don't worry about their hobbies, grades, looks or even personalities.\nStart planning early - what would you like to do? Where would you like to live? What would you like to learn? I think your plan to study fashion is good, and you should decide where you want to be, and get onto the right courses. \nWhether it is summer-planning, or coursework planning, or picking a major, or managing your time, you should take control of your life. I will always be there for you, but the time has come for you to be in the driver's seat - this is your life, and you need to be in control. Being in control feels great. Try it, and you'll love it!\nCollege is the four years where you have: \nl  The greatest amount of free time\nl  the first chance to be independent\nl  the most flexibility to change\nl  the lowest risk for making mistakes\nSo please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny, be   to experiment, learn and grow through your successes and challenges.\nMay your years at Columbia be the happiest of your life, and may you blossom into just what you dream to be.\nLove,\nDad (&Mom)", "id": "high21228.txt"}
