For those who don't know, Paul Smith is an English designer brand.\nHis shirts cost about 1,000 yuan and upwards. I paid 50 yuan for my colorful shirt from a street vendor in Beijing.\nOf course my shirt was a knockoff, a cheap copy of the brand. After a few washes, little balls formed on the surface of the thin material.\nDo I care? Not at all. You get what you pay for.\nI have to admit I hate shopping. _ I have other priorities.\nIn You Are What You Wear, US writer Jennifer Baumgartner says people's clothes tell a story about their personality.\nShe writes: \"The clothes you choose to wear provide important information about you as a person: your approximate education level, your income, social status and even your level of self-esteem  .\" When I started work as an undercover crime reporter, I had to shop for jeans and a hoodie   in order to fit in with a rough and ready   social group.\nI bought the hoodie in a charity shop. My daughters were shocked. They thought I looked bad, but I knew my disguise was perfect.\nElizabeth L. Cline thinks she knows best when it comes to cheap clothes in her book Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion.

At least people now can choose what to wear without breaking the bank.", "id": "high6387.txt"}
