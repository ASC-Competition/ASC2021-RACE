Parents say they love every child equally. But is that true?\nSusan, founder of a consulting firm in Chicago, interviewed 216 women and found that even though none of her questions asked directly about a parent favoring one child over another, about two-thirds of the women said there was a favored child. And they also remembered their experience when they were young. One of the women said, \"My mother always liked my brother better, and he got to go to summer camp in 1968 and I didn't.\"\nPlumez, who interviewed parents with both biological children and adoptive children for an adoption book in 2008, found that what matters most is whether your temperaments  are pleasing. \"In some cases, parents would say they felt closer to their adopted children,\" she says, \"Some parents like the children with characters similar to theirs. Two people who are shy and withdrawn might get along well, unless the shy parent doesn't like that aspect of themselves and they try to push the naturally withdrawn child to be more\n.\"\nIt could be a result of gender, birth order or how easy or difficult a child's temperament may be, but a parent's different treatment has far-reaching effects. Students have found that less-favored children may suffer emotionally, with decreased self-esteem and behavioral problems in childhood. Favoritism is a reason for the next generation not to like each other.\nExperts say it is not realistic to say everyone should be treated equally, because no two people are the same and they relate differently to others.\n\"It does not mean that parent loves or likes one child more. It has to do with which one of them is independent,\" says psychologist Laurie Kramer of the University of Illinois.", "id": "high15925.txt"}
