It wasn't until he got to school that he told a teacher.\" she added.\nBEIJING - At least 15 pupils were confirmed dead after a school bus rolled over in Xuzhou, East China's Jiangsu province.\nThe accident occurred around 6 pm on Monday .There were 29 pupils on the bus .The bus was traveling on the road when two electric bikes suddenly cut in and the driver was trying to avoid them..
