While some question the necessity of such training. Many students see military training as a campus tradition that should be maintained.\nEarly in February, the Ministry of Education issued a new regulation that colleges and universities should carry out a minimum of 14 days compulsory military training for freshmen.\nIn a report by Beijing Evening News, Hou Zhengfang, a Beijing-based education PhD, questioned the benefits of military training. \"The training routine does little to improve students' physical fitness over only two weeks' time. Maybe some disaster prevention training, such as earthquake survival or escaping from fires would be of greater benefit.\"\nMeng Yang, a 19-year-old freshman at Guangxi University, fainted during training. She said that many students, especially girls, are willing to train under direct sunshine. \"For me, military training is physically challenging and even damages my health.\"\nAccording to Li Jian from the student affairs office of Guangzhou University, feeling dizzy  happens frequently during military training and the school has received a lot of complaints from both students and parents: \"But I still think military training is a good thing. Students are easier to manage after the military training. They became more positive about their new environment after the training.\"\nAlthough autumn is fast approaching Beijing, the noon heat burns 3300 freshmen on Tsinghua University's campus. Chu Jinjing, a freshman majoring in medicine, did feel some discomfort while training in sweaty clothes in the glaring heat, the 18-year-old still enjoyed being part of group going through strict exercises. \"By going through this tough training, students bond faster and a sense of belonging to the school can be formed. I've made a lot of friends already.\"\nAccording to the Ministry of Education, the purpose of military training is to teach students discipline, the spirit of teamwork and endurance. But in reality, according to Xiong Bingqi, deputy director of the 21stCentury Education Research Institute, the effect is not satisfying. \"Such goals require long-term development. It is unrealistic to expect military training to make a difference in only 14 days.\" He thus suggests that it should be up to schools to conduct military training in a way that best suits their students.\nHowever, Wang Wenhui, an 18-year-old freshman from Xi'an Jiaotong University, sees military training as a tradition that reaches beyond character building. \"From junior and senior high school to college, we join military training to start a new journey. I would feel a bit incomplete without it.\"", "id": "high5726.txt"}
