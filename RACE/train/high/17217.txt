It's good for you!\" You've probably heard that many times, and it's true. Milk contains calcium , which is necessary for keeping bones and teeth healthy and strong. The US government even requires milk as part of the National School Lunch Program, saying that students should drink one cup of fat-free or low-fat milk every meal.\nHowever, a group of doctors asked the government to take it away from the lunch program. The US 'Physician Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) says, \"Milk is high in sugar, fat and animal protein,\" all of which have negative effects on health. The PCRM says there are better and healthier ways to get calcium such as eating beans, broccoli, cereals and tofu. Orange juice and soymilk that have calcium added to them also supply the nutrient. \"One of the only reasons people prefer milk is that it is going to help build strong bones,\" says Dr Neal Barnard, president of the PCRM. But milk may not be the best way to get calcium your body needs.\nOf course, calcium is important for healthy bones and teeth, but there are other things that affect your bone strength, such as genes, how much vitamin D you take in, and getting an hour's worth of exercise every day.\nSome people disagree with the idea that milk isn't important. Keri Gans, an American Dietitian, says \"I don't think it's irresponsible to take this beverage that children enjoy it very much, especially among those who are unable to meet their nutrient needs for the day, and remove it from the lunch line.\"\nThe U.S government is now considering the request of the PCRM, but a decision may be a long way off. Meanwhile, Marion Nestle, a professor puts it best: \"Milk certainly has nutrients. Other food has the same nutrients. It's just food. As with other food, too much might be a problem.\"", "id": "high17217.txt"}
