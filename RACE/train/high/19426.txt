It is the best passport to discovering another culture. Here are a few tips to help you make the most of the experience. \nWork at your own pace. \nMake the most of the time you have available to study. You will find you can learn more effectively if you study for half an hour every day, rather than try to do a whole unit in one sitting. \nWhy not learn with someone else? \nIt helps if you can learn with someone else. If you can persuade a friend or family member to study with you, it will give you extra motivation to keep working. \nRemember that you can go a long way with just a little language. \nEven if you feel unsure about your ability to form right sentences, you'll find that it is possible to communicate with just a few words.
