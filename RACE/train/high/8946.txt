To do so at 22, as Jennifer\nLawrence has, is just amazing. Recently, the American star won Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards for her role in the film The Silver Linings Playbook. According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, Lawrence is that rare young actress who \"lends a mature intelligence to any role\".\nThough Lawrence has found great success through her big screen work, Lawrence wasn't sure what she really liked doing before the age of 14. She thought she'd go to college and maybe find a career as a doctor or a travel agent.\nLawrence's two brothers were star athletes and one of them was a straight-A student. Unlike them, she suffered through school, never quite finding where she belonged. However, during a trip to New York, Lawrence suddenly realized that she wanted to be an actress. When she was enjoying the beautiful city, a model seeker asked if he could take her picture, and the next day he called her in for an audition  .\n\"I read the script and it was the first time I had that feeling like I understand this,\" Lawrence said.\n\"Within 20 minutes, in the cab ride from the hotel room, I decided I didn't\nwant to be a model. In fact, I wanted to be an actress.\" Having appreciated\nthis young lady's performance, the agency was so impressed with her reading\nthat they signed her on the spot. But she insisted on finishing high school so\nshe could give her full attention to her acting career.\nLawrence burst onto the Hollywood scene last year with The Hunger Games,\nwhich established her as the highest-grossing   female action hero of all time. Rolling Stone called her\"the most talented young actress in America\".", "id": "high8946.txt"}
