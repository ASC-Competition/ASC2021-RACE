And now his army was marching into some parts of Europe. He must be in the prime   of his career.\n    One day Hitler went to an exhibition where the works of school children were on show. He seemed to have great interest in the exhibits--inventions as well as carvings, drawings. After having walked around the hall and examined everything, he said he was ready to meet the young artists. And soon a group of children came into the room to salute (......) him.\n    \"Well, well. You did very good work.\" Nodded Hitler in satisfaction. \"I promise on my honor I'd satisfy you with whatever you want.

I'll have you join my navy and some day you will rule the oceans.\"\n    \"Ask for anything? What'd you wish to be if I were your father?\" he asked a second boy.\n    \"A painter as great as Rembruant.\"\n    \"Good. You are to be sent to the Fine Art School and surely you will make an even greater painter.\"\n    When Hitler caught sight of a sad-looking boy he frowned  , then quickly forced a smile, \"There my boy, in spite of my point of view towards the Jews  , I'd do you a favor and your dream will come true.
