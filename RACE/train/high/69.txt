At the time, a few science fiction magazines began to introduce this author, and to translate a few pieces from his \"Robot Series\". Of Asimov's works, the one that left the deepest impression on me was Pebble in the Sky. This novel directly influenced my early science fiction writing. Asimov was one of the leading writers of western science fiction's Golden Age, so although his writing may not have a direct influence on writers of today, his underlying   influence on many levels is undeniable -- the famous Three Laws of Robotics, and many classic writing techniques, for example. Asimov's novels are marked by a fully integrated   logical system, and his stories are a pleasure to read. This is the reason his novels still attract readers today. Naturally, western science fiction has few people these days who follow Asimov's creative methods. But still the majority of Chinese science fiction readers would rather read the classic works of Asimov. Compared with the \"Robot Series\", Asimov's \"Foundation Series\" is a little less well-known in China. In fact, the \"Foundation Series\" creates an entire world, even grander than that of the \"Robot Series\"; this science fiction had a direct influence on later western science fiction, the most famous example being Star Wars.", "id": "high69.txt"}
