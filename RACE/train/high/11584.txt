They say development, climate change and bushfires have all related to reduce the number of wild koalas sharply. The Australian Koala Foundation said a recent survey showed the population could have dropped by more than half in the past six years. Previous estimates put the number of koalas at more than 100,000, but the latest figures suggest there could now be as few as 43,000.\nThe foundation collected field data from 1,800 sites and 80,000 trees to calculate the numbers. In one area in northern Queensland estimated to have 20,000 koalas a decade ago, a team of eight people could not find a single animal in four days of searching.\nThe foundation said besides problems caused by cutting down forests, hotter and drier conditions because of global warming had reduced the nutritional value of their staple food, eucalyptus leaves, leading to poor nutrition for them.\nKoalas, which live in the forests in Australia's east and south, are very particular about what types of the leaves they eat.\nFoundation chief Deborah Tabart said: \"The koalas are missing everywhere we look. It's really no tree, no me. If you keep cutting down trees you don't have any koalas.\"She is hoping the new figures will persuade the government's Threatened Species Steering Committee (TSSC) to list the koala as threatened. But committee chairman Bob Beeton said a decision was not likely recently and the koala's status as one of the country's favorite animals would not be a factor. \"There's a number of species which are attractive and people have special feelings towards them. We don't consider that,\" Mr. Beeton was reported as saying by the AFP agency.", "id": "high11584.txt"}
