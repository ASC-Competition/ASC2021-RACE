Dr.Chwang, director of the Department of Food Nutrition, says children are consuming more meat and soft drinks. That is a thorough departure from the traditional diet of vegetables and rice and little meat.\" They like big pieces of fried meat with a soft drink. So although they may eat the same volume of food, their calorie intake  has increased. Now that 40 to 45 percent of their calories come from fat,\" says Chwang.\nAlthough on the whole Asians tend to thinness, culture--namely Asians' hospitality--is a reason for the fatness of today's generation, according to Chwang. \"Asian people love food,\" she says.\" Eating and drinking are important social and family functions.\" In the past, however, big meals were only hosted on special occasions, as people were more careful with money. In today's climate of wealth and remarkable consumption,10-course meals are no longer reserved for significant occasions.\n\"In the past, people had four or more children--now, they have one or two, so they tend to spoil them,\" says Chwang. \"The earliest way is to give them quality food. Parents think feeding them well is showing their love. They feel bad when their children look thin.\"\nWhen describing the physical condition of most overweight Asian children, Chwang says: \"there is a clear relation between fatness and indoor play. Children get fat because they don't move, and eventually, they don't want to move because they are fat.\"\nThanks to technology, a growing army of children prefer video games to old outdoor sports. \"What do children do when watching TV or sitting in front of the computer playing video games? They eat chocolate and drink Coke,\" says Chwang.", "id": "high19979.txt"}
