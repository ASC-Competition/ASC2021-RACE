If you live near a city center or an airport, you could make anything up to PS200 or PS300 a week. Put an advertisement for free on Letpark or Atmyhousepark.\nRent a room\nSpare room? Not only will a lodger earn you an income, but also, thanks to the government-backed \"rent a room\" program, you won't have to pay any tax on the first PS4500 you make per year. Try advertising your room on Roomspare or Roommateeasy.\nMake money during special events\nDon't want a full-time lodger? Then rent on a short-term basis. If you live in the capital, renting a room out during the Olympics or other big events could bring in money.

In return, they get paid for unused energy fed back into the National Grid. However, you have to sign a 25-year agreement with the supplier, which could prevent you from changing the roof.", "id": "high1547.txt"}
