The woman was the grandmother of an eight-year-old boy who had gone missing an hour before. She was so anxious that she looked pale. With fear she trembled all the time.\nThey came to ask us about it. I said we hadn't seen the boy, but we would help to look for him. I asked my two-year-old daughter if she understood why we had to go looking for this boy and couldn't finish dinner right then. She replied, \"Be kind people, Daddy.\"  _ !\nWe hopped  into our truck and went searching all over the town for about an hour and a half. Along the way, as we asked various strangers on the street if they had seen this little boy. A group of kids said they would help too. They hopped on their bikes and joined the search without any hesitation. I was surprised and very impressed. What a moving scene!\nThe little boy was found safe and sound a few miles away in forest. He had just decided to go on a little adventure on his own as his story said. Finding him, his grandmother was moved to tear.\nI was just so happy to see so many people joined the search for a complete stranger. At least two dozen people from the neighborhood went looking for this boy just because being\"kind people\"was the right thing to do.", "id": "high21901.txt"}
