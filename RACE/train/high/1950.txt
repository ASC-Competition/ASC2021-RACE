Most people will agree that the thatched roof is an essential part of the attraction of the English countryside.\nThatching is in fact the oldest of all the building crafts practised in the British Isles. Although thatch has always been used for cottage and farm buildings, it was once used for castles and churches, too.\nThatching is a solitary craft, which often runs in families. The craft of thatching as it is practised toady has changed very little since the Middle Ages. Over 800 full-time thatchers are employed in England and Wales today, keeping and renewing the old roofs as well as thatching newer houses. Many property owners choose thatch not only for its beauty but because they know it will keep them cool in summer and warm in winter.\nIn fact, if we look at developing countries, over half the world lives under thatch, but they all do it in different ways. People in developing countries are often unwilling to go back to traditional materials and would prefer modern buildings. However, they may lack the money to allow them to get the necessary materials. Their temporary mud huts with thatched roofs of wild grasses often only last six months. Thatch which has been done the British way lasts from twenty to sixty years, and is an effective defiance against the heat.", "id": "high1950.txt"}
