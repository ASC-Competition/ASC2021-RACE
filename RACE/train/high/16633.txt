Nearly 1700 scientists, businessmen and policy-makers, one-quarter from the foreign nations, gathered for a week to discuss various means of squeezing usable energy out of trees, crops, sea plants and urban waste. Biomass energy in the prefix = st1 /United Statescontributes 2.5 percent of the total supply, but this amount can be doubled by 2017 and then doubled again by the year 2027.\n  Eight percent of Sweden's energy supply, for example, is presently coming from wood and pulp  remaining. Swedenintends to raise this percentage by more intensive harvesting of waste food lying around in forests, and through the planting of so-called energy forests of fast-growing trees such as willow.\n  Brazilis frequently pointed to as a nation with a major successful investment in energy coming from grains: it presently runs 330,000 automobiles on a water and alcohol mixture, replacing 10 percent of its previous oil supply. Brazilian representatives at the conference said they wish to double this in five years, with a final goal of total replacement. Most of the cars are built at the factory to use the mixture, while older models are changed through low-cost government programs.", "id": "high16633.txt"}
