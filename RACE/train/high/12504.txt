Our discomfort comes not so much from the thing itself; it comes from our umamiliarity with it.After all, an oyster has remarkably the same look as a sheep's eye; and a first look at a lobster would remind almost anybody of a creature from a science fiction movie, not something you dip in butter and eat.By the way, in Saudi Arabia sheep's eyes are a famous dish and in parts of China it's bear's paw soup.\nCan you refuse such food without being rude? Most experienced business travelers say no, at least not before taking at least a few bites.It helps, though, to slice any item very thin.This way, you minimize the taste and the reminder of where it came from.Or, \" Swallow it quickly, \" as one traveler recommends.\"I still can't tell you what sheep's eyeballs taste like.\" As for dealing with taste, the old line that \"it tastes just like chicken\" is often thankfully true.Even when the \"it\" is really rat or snake.\nAnother useful piece of advice is not knowing what you are eating.What's for dinner? Don't ask. Avoid glancing into the kitchen or looking at English-language menus.Your host will be pleased that you are eating the food he offers, and who knows? Maybe it really is chicken in that soup.", "id": "high12504.txt"}
