No one tells us that the greatest moments of a lifetime are short, unplanned and nearly always catch us off guard. \nNot long ago,as I was reading a bedtime story to my seven-year-old daughter, Annie,I became aware of her focused look. She was staring at me with a faraway, blank expression. Apparently, completing The Tale of Samuel Whiskers was not as important as we first thought. \nI asked what she was thinking about. \"Mommy,\" she whispered, \"I just can't stop looking at your pretty face.\"I almost dissolved  on the spot. Little did she know how many trying moments the glow of her sincerely loving statement would carry me through over the following years. \nNot long after, I took my four-year-old son to an elegant department store, where the sweet notes of a classic love song drew us toward a tuxedoed  musician playing a grand piano. Sam and I sat down on a marble bench nearby, and he seemed as astonished by the pleasant theme as I was. I didn't realize that Sam had stood up next to me until he turned, took my face in his little hands and said, \"Dance with me.\"\nIf only those women walking under the Paris moon knew the joy of such an invitation made by a round-cheeked boy with baby teeth. Although shoppers openly chuckled  and pointed at us as we glided and whirled  around the open space, I would not have traded a dance with such a charming young gentleman if I'd been offered the universe.", "id": "high19579.txt"}
