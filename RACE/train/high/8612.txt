Those stories aroused feelings of awe   and made the readers want to share this positive emotion with others.\nBesides science stories, readers were also found to be likely to share articles that were exciting or funny. \"The more positive an article was, the more likely it was to be shared,\" Berger wrote in his new book. \"For example, stories about newcomers falling in love with New York City,\" he writes, \"tended to be shared more than the death of a popular zookeeper.\"\nBut does all this good news actually make the audience feel better? Not necessarily.\nAccording to a study by researchers at Harvard University, people tend to say more positive things about themselves when they're talking to a bigger audience, rather than just one person, which helps explain all the perfect vacations that keep showing up on microblogs. This, researchers found, makes people think that life is unfair and that they're less happy than their friends.\nBut no worries. There's a quick and easy way to relieve the depression you get from viewing other people's seemingly perfect lives--turn on the television and watch the news. There is always someone doing worse than you are.", "id": "high8612.txt"}
