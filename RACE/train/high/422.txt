I'd be surprised if they even last as long as 20 years,\" said Laurence Frank, project director of Living With Lions, a Kenya-based animal protection organization. \"When I first came here 30 years ago, I would always hear lions roaring across the land at night and see their tracks in the morning. Now that is very rare.\"\n\"The reason is simple. As the numbers of people grow and the numbers of cows increase, they take up much of the lion's space. Alongside that there are other ways, including poisoning, to kill lions.\"\nAnimal lovers are making a new strategy to save the animals. Part of the measures will include tracking lions fitted with radio collars   in the Amboseli area in southern Kenya, close to the border with Tanzania.\nWildlife officials in Tanzania face similar challenges in protecting their lions, but there is far less human encroachment  on the animals' homeland there than in Kenya.", "id": "high422.txt"}
