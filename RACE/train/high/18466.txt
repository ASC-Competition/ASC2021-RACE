Their drivers won't have to stop at gas stations as often as usual.\nThe technology is more than just cool. In our car-filled world,plug-in vehicles could reduce the amount of gas we use,which keeps rising in cost now and then. Besides,driving around in these vehicles may even help the environment.Gas-burning cars produce a lot of greenhouse gas,which causes globe warming.\nThe first company-produced plug-in vehicles could hit the roads by 2010. But engineers still have a lot of work to do to make the technology practical and inexpensive.\nBatteries  are the biggest challenge. In the plug-in-vehicle world,Li-ion batteries are getting the most attention.These batteries can store a large amount of energy in a small package,and they last a longer time between charges.Li-ion batteries can fit laptops,cell phones,heart instruments and other similar pocket ones.\nBut because cars are so big and heavy, it would still require a suitcase-sized Li-ion batteries to power about 12km of driving.What's more,the batteries are much expensive.\n\"A car filled with batteries could go a long distance,\"says Ted Bohn, an electrical engineer in Chicago.\"But it couldn't pull any people.and it would cost $100,000.\"\nSo researchers need to work out how to make batteries smaller and cheaper,among other questions.\n\"The answers don't exist yet,\"Bohn says,\"As a kid,I thought someone someplace knows the answer to everything.All of these questions haven't been decided.That's what engineering is about-making a guess,running tests and getting fine results.\"", "id": "high18466.txt"}
