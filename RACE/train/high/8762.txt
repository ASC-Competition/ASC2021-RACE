I have heard these sons and daughters say they never fully appreciated their mothers until it was too late to tell them.\nI am blessed with the dear mother who is still alive. I appreciate her more each day. My mother does not change, but I do. As I grow older and wiser, I realize what an extraordinary person she is. How sad that I am unable to speak these words in her presence, but they flow easily from my pen.\nHow does a daughter begin to thank her mother for life itself?
