It is the time when I realize that the books my English teacher assigned to me are not going to read themselves and that I have a difficult month in front of me.\nYou might think that I don't want to spend my summer reading, but that's not the problem: I love reading. On the first day of my summer holidays this year, I went to the library and got \"A Gathering of Old Men\" by African-American writer Ernest Gaines. I enjoyed it very much. I read all the magazines that my parents subscribe to and spend about 30 minutes every day with the morning paper. So why do I hate summer reading for school? Because the books on summer reading lists are often slow-going and just uninviting. Teachers and librarians don't understand that summer reading can be entertaining as well as educational. They choose books that a friend of my mother's calls \"spinach books\": good for you, but not much fun to take in. Every summer, I read them, hate them and get bitter about the experience.\nThis bitterness started three years ago when I was about to begin high school. As preparation, my English teacher told me to read \"The Age of Innocence\" by American author Edith Wharton. I'm sure there are many people who enjoyed \"The Age of Innocence\"--some might even say it's their favorite book.\nBut I don't think any of these people read it as a 14-year-old boy on his summer vacation.\n\"The Age of Innocence\" is the story of a forbidden romance in prefix = st1 /New York100 years ago. At 14, my only experience with romance was my love for baseball. I couldn't imagine being in love, much less being in love in 1900. \"The Age of Innocence\" was totally different to my life.\nMost of my required summer reading has been like that--books written in a style that plays up the adjectives and plays down the verbs. I guess teachers don't think exciting plots make for \"good literature\". To me, though, a good writer describes events and characters in a way that makes the reader want to know what happens next.\nIf I were making up a summer reading list, it would include \"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\" by George V. Higgins, \"The Right Stuff\" by Tom Wolfe, and \"Into Thin Air\" by Jon Krakauer. These are all books that have literary value but, just as important, can also entertain kids on vacation. If the teachers could stand a little fun in the books they assign, my Augusts would be a lot more enjoyable.", "id": "high22257.txt"}
