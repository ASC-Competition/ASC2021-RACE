He was wearing three shirts, a jacket, two pairs of socks, a pair of shorts, and two pairs of jeans. He was carrying one small backpack, which was very full, but he didn't have any other luggage. Brian needed to meet a man named Tony before he checked in for his flight. He found Tony near the Air France counter. Tony gave him a round-trip ticket and a small package.\n\"Give this package to Jean-Paul at the airport in Paris. He will have a sign with your name on it. I think you can find him easily,\" Tony said, \"You don't have any luggage, right?\"\n\"Only this backpack,\" Brian answered. \"You said I could bring one carry-on bag.\"\n\"That's right. One carry-on bag is fine. Have a good trip.\"\n\"Thanks.\"\nIs Brian a criminal ? Not at all. He is an air-courier. And he paid only $110 for the round-trip ticket to Paris. Air couriers get cheap airline tickets because they take important packages and papers to foreign countries. Businesses sometimes need to get packages and papers to people in foreign countries by the next day. Often, the only way they can do this is to use an air-courier company. It is not cheap for a business to send a package with an air courier, but it is quick.\nEvery year about 80,000 people worldwide travel as air couriers. The number of tickets for courier travel is growing by about 10 percent a year. However, air-courier travel isn't for everyone. But if you have very little money, can be flexible  about your travel plans, and don't mind wearing the same clothes for a week, it can be a great way to take a vacation!", "id": "high7601.txt"}
