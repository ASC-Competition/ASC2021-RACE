EUR", "\"The Giraffe Project\" is a group   _  .", "People call Claude and Hankins \"giraffes\" because they   _  .", "The passage mainly tries to tell us   _  ."], "article": "Claude and Louris are \"giraffes\". So are police officers Hankins and Pearson. These men and women don't look like giraffes; they look like you and me. Then, why do people call them \"giraffes\"?\nA giraffe, they say, is an animal that sticks its neck out, can see places far away and has a large heart. It lives a quiet life and moves about in an easy and beautiful way. In the same way, a \"giraffe\" can be a person who likes to \"stick his or her neck out\" for other people, always watches for future happenings, has a warm heart for people around, and at the same time lives a quiet and beautiful life himself or herself.\n\"The Giraffe Project\" is a 10-year-old group which finds and honors \"giraffes\" in the US and in the world. The group wants to teach people to do something to build a better world. The group members believe that a person shouldn't draw his or her head back; instead, they tell people to \"stick their neck out\" and help others. Claude and Louris, Hankins and Pearson are only a few of the nearly 1,000 \"giraffes\" that the group found and honored.\nClaude and Louris were getting old and they left their work with some money that they saved for future use. One day, however, they saw a homeless man looking for a place to keep warm and they decided that they should \"stick their neck out\" and give him some help. Today, they lived in Friends' House, where they invite twelve homeless people to stay every night.\nPolice officers Hankins and Pearson work in a large city. They see crimes every day and their work is sometimes dangerous. They work hard for their money. However, these two men put their savings together and even borrowed money to start an educational center to teach young people in a poor part of the city. Hankins and Pearson are certainly \"giraffes\".", "id": "high23970.txt"}
