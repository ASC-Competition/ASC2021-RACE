But we are accustomed to such weather in England. Lord Byron used to say that an English summer begins on July 31 and ends on Aug. 1. He called 1816 \"the year without a summer.\" He spent it gazing across Lake Geneva, watching the storms, with 18-year-old Mary Shelley. The lightening flickering across the lake inspired her Frankenstein, the tale of the man-made monster galvanized into life by electricity.\nThis summer's atrocious weather tempted me to tease a Green whom I know. \"Well, what about your weather theory now?\" (One of the characteristics of Greens is that they know no history.) He replied: \"Yes, this weather is unprecedented. England has never had such an August before. It's global warming, of course.\" That's the Greens' stock response to anything weather-related. Too much sun? \"Global warming.\" Too little sun? \"Global warming.\" Drought? \"Global warming.\" Floods? \"Global warming.\" Freezing cold? \"Global warming.\"\nI wish the great philosopher Sir Karl Popper were alive to _ the unscientific nature of global warming. He was a student when Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity was first published and then successfully tested. Einstein said that for his theory to be valid it would have to pass three tests. \"If,\" Einstein wrote to British scientist Sir Arthur Eddington, \"it were proved that this effect does not exist in nature, then the whole theory would have to be abandoned.\"\nThe idea that human beings have changed and are changing the basic climate system of the Earth through their industrial activities and burning of fossil fuels--the essence of the Greens' theory of global warming--has not much basis in science. Global warming, like Marxism, is a political theory of actions, demanding compliance with its rules.\nThose who buy in to global warming wish to drastically curb human economic and industrial activities, regardless of the consequences for people, especially the poor. If the theory's conclusions are accepted and agreed upon, the destructive results will be felt most severely in those states that adhere to the rule of law and will observe restrictions most faithfully. The global warming activists' target is the U.S. If America is driven to accept crippling restraints on its economy it will rapidly become unable to shoulder its burdens as the world's sole superpower and ultimate defender of human freedoms. We shall all suffer, however, as progress falters and then ceases and living standards decline.", "id": "high3973.txt"}
