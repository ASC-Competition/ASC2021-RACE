My next class, Spanish, scared me. I just could not speak that language. As the bell rang, I ran to the classroom.\nAt the door, a hand reached out and shook mine firmly. I looked up. A man with large glasses smiled. He introduced himself as Profe, which means teacher in Spanish. Right away, his warm smile and welcoming words eased my fears. That year, I enjoyed his classes a great deal because I learned more than just Spanish.\nI admit I only speak a little Spanish. But I try to live out the life lessons I learned from Profe. Every day Profe stood outside his classroom before and after class to give his \"hand hug\". After school his room was always filled with students and he would talk to and chat with them--even those not in his class. He taught me that every person is worth your time.\nOne time, I was rejected by my friends, Profe told me, \"Linda, life gives you ashes. But learning its lessons will turn those ashes to jewels.\" Therefore, I learned to look at my troubles differently and not to fear any difficulty.\nIn my senior year, I became president of one of the school's clubs, so I was very busy. Many times I didn't even have time to buy lunch. He served me by giving me his food as well as advice. He lived out what he taught us to do: serve others.\nThe author William Arther Ward wrote: \"The mediocre  teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.\" Thank you , Profe, for inspiring me.", "id": "high5596.txt"}
