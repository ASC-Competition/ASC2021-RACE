But recently a Britain's Got Talent star Susan Boyle has changed our views absolutely.\nSimon Cowell ,one of the judges of the talent show spoke of his shock over Ms Boyle's voice. \"This lady camp up ,and I'm thinking, 'This will take five seconds and I can go to have a cup of tea'. That changed when she began to sing I Dreamed to Dream from Les Miserables. She knew we were going to have that reaction and just to see that look of satisfaction on her face through -it was one of my favorite moments,\" Cowell said.\nThe performance was posted on line and before long, the 47-year-old Scottish woman has been famous all over the world.\nSpeaking from her home in Scotland, Ms Boyle said that she hasn't thought of changing her appearance. She said that her friend helped her with make-up. \"I mean, that's hardly a makeover,\" she added.Ms Boyle also spoke of the reason she first began to explore her vocal talents, \"I was kind of slow at school, so getting like singing was a good way of hiding behind that and thus it built my confidence.\"", "id": "high2469.txt"}
