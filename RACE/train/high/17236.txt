Can I still say baseball? You could make that statement 30 years ago,but things have changed.Baseball of course has the richest history of all sports.But with the popularity of basketball and American football,there can now be an argument on which sport is American's number one sport.    \n    Basketball really took a turn in the1980's as Magic Johnson and Larry Bird took the NBA to another level.Of course,basketball was already popular and had seen such stars as Jerry West and Dr.J,but the real breakthrough came in the 1980's and from there it really took off with Michael Jordan into the 90's.Basketball has even become very global now as many NBA stars competed in the Olympics and faced no competition.Today,they had better be ready because there are so many talents in other countries and the competition will be stiff.\n    Like basketball,American football has always been a favorite of many sports fans and its popularity has grown widely.The ratings that Super Bowl Sunday brings are amazing.They have even talked about making Super Bowl Sunday a national holiday.\nIn the year 2050,basketball and American football will have history like baseball's rich history and maybe American national sport.They have been trying for years,but it is not going to happen.\nSo what is American's number one sport? To me baseball will always be Americans' hobby--rich in history and many memories for people of all ages.If you have any comments on this subject,do give your opinions.", "id": "high17236.txt"}
