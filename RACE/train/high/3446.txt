Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said.\nJonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem.

When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said.\nFoods for Recovery\nWhat are the best foods to help the body recover after rigorous (strict) competition?\nFor Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil.
