Smaller species, including such as nice and small squirrels, are not as common\noverall in high tropical canopies as they are in most habitats globally.\nSmall mammals, being warm blooded, suffer hardship in the exposed and uncertain\nenvironment of the uppermost trees. Because a small body has more surface area per unit of\nweight than a large one of similar shape, it gains or loses heat more rapidly. Thus, in the trees,\nwhere protection from heat and cold may be scarce and conditions may be changeable, a\nsmall mammal may have trouble maintaining its body temperature.\nSmall size makes it easy to scramble among twigs   and branches in the canopy for\ninsects, flowers, or fruit, but small mammals are defeated, in the competition for food, by\nlarge ones that have their own strategies for browsing among tbod-rich twigs. The weight of\nan ape hanging below a branch draws the leaves down so that fruit-bearing leaves drop\ntoward the ape's face. Walking or leaping species of a similar or even larger size access the\nouter twigs either by breaking and gaining the whole branch or by catching hold of hard\nbranches with the feet or tail and picking food with their hands.\nSmall climbing animals may reach twigs readily, but it is harder for them than for large\nclimbing animals to cross the wide gaps from one tree top to the next that typify the high\ncanopy. A gibbon can hurl itself farther than a mouse can: it can achieve a running start, and it\ncan more effectively use a branch as a springboard  . The forward movement of a small\nanimal is seriously reduced by the air friction   against the  ly large surface area\nof its body.", "id": "high21798.txt"}
