His mother had died two years earlier, and he was the only caretaker of his younger brother, Cole, 16, and sister, Jazzlyn, seven. He was desperate for a regular salary after cutting lawns  and doing other temporaryjobs.\nThree hours into his hard trip, Reagan had covered only three miles. He paused outside a Cajun restaurant called Papa Roux to ask for directions from owner Art Bouvier, who was clearing ice and snow from the parking lot. \"I told him to get on the bus,\" says Bouvier. \"He thanked me and went on his way.\"\nFifteen minutes later, Bouvier pulled up in his car beside Reagan as he walked along. \"You've really got to be on the bus,\" he told Reagan. \"I don't have money for the bus,\" Reagan replied. Bouvier offered him a lift. On the way, he asked the boy about his job search.\n\"I thought, This is the kind of kid I want working for me,\" says Bouvier. He got the teen's phone number and dropped him off for his interview.\nLater that day, Bouvier wrote about Reagan on Facebook. \"He doesn't know it yet, but he starts on Monday,\" Bouvier wrote. \"It's been a while since I've met someone so young with a work ethic  like that!\" A few hours later, Bouvier called to offer Reagan a job. Shocked, the teen accepted on the spot. A television reporter _ the story and interviewed the pair on camera that night.\nToday, Reagan is washing dishes, filling orders, and greeting Papa Roux customers for $8.50 an hour. The publicity  has brought in so many new customers that Bouvier plans to open a second restaurant by the end of the year.", "id": "high5210.txt"}
