I still remember to this day where I was and how it all came down. I was in my social studies classroom, when a teacher came back and told us that the first building of the World Trade Center was hit by a plane. We immediately stopped our work and turned on the television. Throughout half the day we watched TV until the school was forced to let all of us home early. I walked home and immediately turned on the television and watched until my bedtime. I remember always seeing the towers walking to my Tae Kwon Do school; to me, a boy teenager, it was a great thing because at that time I have never seen any other building that caught my eye as much as  _ did. And walking to my school that day was just a horrifying dream. Crossing the busy road of the Bell Pike was a big cloud of smoke and dust. It was very upsetting. Every day after that horrific day I looked up to the once stood Twin Towers just to see nothing there. To my eyes, that day will always be in my mind and in my heart, even though I didn't lose any loved ones, I still feel the pain as if I did. September 11th, 2001 will never be forgotten.", "id": "high21743.txt"}
