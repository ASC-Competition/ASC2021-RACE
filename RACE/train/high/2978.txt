She fooled me again.\"\nWu released a women's clothing and accessories collection at Target last year and continues to be popular with the First Lady for official engagements.\nThe sleeveless, cross-halter neck dress with low-cut back flattered 49-year-old Michelle's arms and neat waist.\nIt had been created especially for her by Wu and was a departure from the dark and plain colour tone she stuck to at earlier inauguration events.\nMrs Obama's new hairstyle -- she had bangs cut on her birthday last week  had been loosely tousled for the special night.\nVice-President Joe Biden's wife Jill also looked attractive in a blue silk dress by Vera Wang at the Inauguration Ball.", "id": "high2978.txt"}
