What was it?\n    According to a recent survey, we spend about ten minutes a day looking for lost things. Over an average lifetime, this adds up to an incredible 3,680 hours (or 153 days). Is there anything we can do about it?\n    The study of 3,000 adults was carried out by home insurance company Esure. They found that mobile phones and car keys were the most frequently lost items. Other things on the list included: house keys, bills, sunglasses, wallets, bank cards, watches, jewellery (particularly rings and earrings).\n    So, what's going on? \"Most blame it on a busy lifestyle,\" says Nikki Sellers, the head of Esure. Others say it's the fault of spouses   or children for not putting things back where they belong. A few admitted to untidiness, absent-mindedness and a poor memory, with some wishing they were more organized.\n   What's the solution? \"You need to choose a particular place for something and always put it back there,\" said Nikki Sellers. \"And you need to make sure everyone else in the house knows where to put it back too. You also need to keep your house tidy, label boxes clearly and find a place near the front door for all the items that you need in the morning. A good idea would be to have a shelf there with a bowl for your keys, purse, wallet and anything else.\" she added.\n       If you are still having trouble finding things, don't worry -- things could be a lot worse: fourteen people in the survey said they spent over an hour every day looking for lost items. Surely you can't be as bad as that!", "id": "high23233.txt"}
