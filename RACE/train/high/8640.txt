I fear she would be very disappointed looking at the world today. A lot of people don't smile and when it comes to service today, they're just not nice. Now don't give me wrong, not all service workers but a good many.\nI was on the phone the other day with a computer help desk. First a man, then later a woman, who couldn't have been ruder. And this to a customer, who didn't know his way around a PC. But no matter, I could tell they thought I was a bother, The woman, in fact, seemed to be chewing gum as she unemotionally clicked off a series of commands for me to perform.\nThe next day I heard from a friend of mine who got a performance review without his boss once looking up at him. Not once.\nYou see it everywhere. Gone are the days when people cared about you. It's a sign of the time, I suspect. But that makes me sad -- for them and for us all. People who aren't happy, who don't smile, who don't kid, who don't joke or make light of even bad situations, make for an even worse situation.\nAnd it spreads like a cancer. Someone's rude to you, you're rude to them and to the next fellow you meet, and on and on. Smiles are contagious but so annoyances. The boss who can't be bothered with his workers. The celebrity who can't be bothered with her annoying fans.\nYou know, my mom used to judge presidential candidates by how they smiled. I would say, \"But mom, you don't know if that smile is real.\"\n\"Oh, yes I do,\" she would tell me. \"I can feel it.\"\nIt's in their eyes, she would say. And it's in their smile. The rest just kind of falls into place.", "id": "high8640.txt"}
