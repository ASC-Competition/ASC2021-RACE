Ellison, originally from Oklahoma worked hard to match his earlier success but felt that he could not make any progress on his next novel that eventually came to include well over 2000 pages. It was not until Ellison's death that this novel was condensed  ,edited and published under the title Juneteenth.\nWriter: Margaret Mitchell Novel: Gone with the wind\nMargaret Mitchell, born in Georgia, never wanted to seek out literary success and wrote this expansive work in secret, only sending to publishers after she was mocked  by a colleague who didn't believe she was capable of writing a novel. She turned out to be more than capable, and the book won a Pulitzer Prize and was adapted into one of the best-known and loved films of all time. Mitchell would not get a chance to write another novel, as she was struck and killed by a car on her way to the cinema at only 49 years of age.\nWriter: Anna Sewell Novel: Black Beauty\nSewell didn't start off her life intending to be a novelist, she didn't begin writing Black Beauty until she was 51 years old, motivated by the need to create a work that encouraged people to treat horses ( and humans) humanely and it took her six years to complete it. Upon publication it was an immediate bestseller, rocketing Sewell into success. Unfortunately, she would not live to enjoy but a little of it as she died of hepatitis  five months after her book was released.", "id": "high19328.txt"}
