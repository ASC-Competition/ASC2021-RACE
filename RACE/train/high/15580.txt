What are you worried about?\"she asked.I hesitated.She was obviously very involved in his care and it was only fair that I told her the truth.\"Well.we need to prove it's not cancer.\"I said and talked briefly about some of the tests I was going to order.\nHalf an hour later, a nurse called me:\"Mr. McMahon's daughter broke down--she said you told her he had cancer.\"My heart sank.By the time I arrived at the ward,my consultant was already there,explaining that we still had to run lots of tests and that it was by no means confirmed that he had cancer.I stood silently at the end of the bed.My consultant was obviously angry with me and as we left Mr. McMahon,she turned to me.\"Why on earth did you do that?\"she asked in disbelief.I looked at her and bit my lip.\"She asked me what I was worried about and I told her.\"I said,hanging my head.\"And give her more to worry about?\"replied my consultant.\"You don't say the word'cancer'until it's confirmed.Even if you suspect it,think very carefully before you tell people.\"\nAs it turned out, it wasn't cancer.But I did learn that when someone is stressed and worried about their loved one they're sometimes selective in what they hear and as a doctor it's important to be mindful of this.In being truthful,I'd made the situation worse.", "id": "high15580.txt"}
