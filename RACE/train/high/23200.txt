On the contrary, a lack of such playtime can create stress for both children and parents, and it can also cause obesity when children spend too much time sitting in front of educational videos. The report notes lack of playtime could even lead to depression in many children. \nThe report thinks the lack of playtime lies in the fact that parents want to have super-smart children and safe places for children to play is decreasing.

Betty Brazelton agreed. \"Children with structured activities\" are missing the chance to dream, to make their own world work the way they want it. That to me is a very important part of childhood.", "id": "high23200.txt"}
