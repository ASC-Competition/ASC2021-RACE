The tour ends mid-afternoon back in Paris where you will have the remainder of the day for your leisure. In the evening there is a \"Paris By Night\" tour that shows you the beautiful buildings with bright lights.\nDay three takes you to Montmartre, perhaps the most charming quarter of Paris and home of the Sacre Coeur and the Moulin Rouge.
