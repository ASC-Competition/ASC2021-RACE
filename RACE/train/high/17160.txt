The 14-year-old high school freshman from New Rochele, New York, plays computer video games online for a couple of hours, pausing only to instant-message his friends, check his blog or download a new song to his IPOD.

But adults generally view computers as mere tools for work , not toys.\nDespite this difference, most parents realize that computers, cell phones and the like are fixtures  in their children's lives.

Once you know what's what, try to keep the lines of communication open and carefully watch what they're doing.", "id": "high17160.txt"}
