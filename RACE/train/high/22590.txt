Here we will take care of 150 children.The days are always full and never dull.We will volunteer at a lion reserve later, where we will help care for baby lions.We will also spend one day at another reserve taking in the beauty of the African landscape and hoping to catch sight of giraffes, zebras and the African elephants.\nWHO: Students aged 16 and above are invited to participate as our valued Student Ambassadors.A working knowledge of the English language is required.Adults are invited and needed to participate in the program as Adult Mentors, who will lend your unique skills and support throughout the program.We can promise you all an unforgettable, life-changing journey!\n         WHEN: July 24, 2012 to August 7, 2012\n         COST: $ 1, 750 plus the cost of airfare", "id": "high22590.txt"}
