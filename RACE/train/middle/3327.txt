However, when it comes to France, you have another special choice: treehouses.\nIn France, treehouses are offered to travelers as a new choice in many places. The price may be a little higher, but you do have a chance to _ your childhood memories.\nAlain Laurens, one of France's top treehouse designers, said, \"Most of the people might have the experience of building a den   when they were young. And they like that feeling of freedom when they are children.\"\nIts fairy-tale style gives travelers a special feeling. It seems as if they are living as a forest king and enjoying the fresh air in the morning.\nAnother kind of treehouse is the \"star cube\". It gives travelers the chance of looking at the stars shining in the sky when they are going to sleep. Each \"star cube\" not only offers all the comfortable things that a hotel provides for travelers, but also gives them a chance to look for stars by using a telescope. The glass roof allows you to look at the stars from your bed.\n,.", "id": "middle3327.txt"}
