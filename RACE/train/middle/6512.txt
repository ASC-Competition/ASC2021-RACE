So I crossed the road to wish him a good morning.\nAs I came over to him, he was very happy to see me. He said it was nice of me to come and chat with him. Then he said to me in a low and sad voice: \"At this stage of my life, it feels very lonely here. Anybody sharing a few heartfelt moments would mean a lot to me. \"\nI was completely shocked by what he said, and I wondered: What could be that little thing that I can do to make his life different?\nI knew he was a painter, so I started to ask him about his latest painting experiences. Painting is a passionate   topic for him, and he started to talk with me about it. I asked him, \"Can you teach me to paint?\"\nHe was surprised at first and then agreed instantly.\nNow, every other day, I go to learn how to paint from him. We paint a lot and talk a lot. He says he feels better, and he waits for me. I say I feel better. After all, I am the one getting so much wisdom from a man who is nearing the horizon of his life with so much experience!", "id": "middle6512.txt"}
