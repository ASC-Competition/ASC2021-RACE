My parents had to bring up  my three younger sisters and two younger brothers, so I found three part-time jobs to pay for my studies. I worked early mornings and late nights, so I was tired, really tired, all the time.\nUnluckily, I got a cold and had a very high fever. Because I was new in London, I had no friends. Besides, I was too shy to talk with others and ask others for help. After sleeping on the bed for two days, I went out to get some food. Usually, I went to the supermarket, but this time I went into the Greek shop, a small corner shop, because it was closer.\nI picked up some food and gave it to the shopkeeper, who asked me, 'You look terrible, my boy! You are not feeling well, right?'\nI said YES in a low voice.\nShe pointed at the salami   and bread I was buying and offered, 'I can make you a sandwich, so you don't have to do it yourself.'\nI nodded without saying a word.\nSo, she made the sandwich and asked me to wait a moment. She went into the back room and came again with a bowl of hot soup.\n'It will warm you up,' she said with a friendly smile.\nWhat really warmed me up was not the soup. It was her smile that told me she cared me. Her kindness  made me think of my mother.\nI was quite shy, but from that day on, I did not let shyness stop me from talking with and being kind to others. Now I work in a children's hospital in Africa. I love my work and people around me. I always bring my smile and kindness to them.", "id": "middle5400.txt"}
