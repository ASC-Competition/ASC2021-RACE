This process  helps you deal with culture shock .\nCulture shock begins with the \"honeymoon period\". This is the time when you first arrive in a place where everything about the new cu1ture is strange and exciting. You see new things, hear new sounds and language, eat new kinds of food. This period can last for quite a long time because you feel very happy.\nUnluckily, the second period can be more difficu1t.  After you have got used to your new life, you can become very tired and begin to miss your motherland, your family, your friends, your pets and so on.

Your sense of humor usually becomes stronger and you realize you are becoming stronger by 1earning to take care of yourself in the new place. Things are still difficult, but you are now a survivor .\nThe fourth period can be cal1ed \"at ease at last\". Now you feel quite comfortable in your new place. You can deal with most problems that you have. You may still have prob1ems with language,but you know you are strong enough to deal with them. At this time, you may feel a little uncomfortable if you go back to your motherland.", "id": "middle1799.txt"}
