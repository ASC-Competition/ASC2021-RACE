And he had many chores. For example,on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays he took out the rubbish. And on weekends he always washed his father's car. He also cleaned his own room once a week. What a chore that was! Sometimes he even had to look after his little sister and brother.\nSam had a foreign friend at school. His name was Kumar. Doing chores in Kumar's family was very different. In the house only the girls did chores. His sisters made all the beds and cleaned all the rooms too, even his bedroom.His mother always cooked the meals, and his sisters helped her to go shopping, and prepare the food. They worked hard at home,doing all the chores with their mother. So when Kumar talked to his friend Sam about chores, he felt very lucky. One day, Sam had an idea. He asked Kumar,\"Could I borrow your sisters? \" He wanted them to help him clean his room,but they said \" no \"  Instead, they asked Sam to teach their brother how to do chores, so he could make his own bed.\nSam and Kumar are very good at science. They are going to be scientists after university. They want to make a robot to do the chores. Then everyone-mothers and fathers, sons and daughters-will be happy!", "id": "middle5291.txt"}
