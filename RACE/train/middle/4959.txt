If your answer is\"happier\", then you are right,based on a study published seven years ago.It found that people become happier and experience less worry after age fifty.In fact,it found that by the age of eighty-five,people are happier with their life than they were at eighteen.\nThe finding came from a Gallup survey of more than three hundred and forty thousand adults in the United States in 2008.At that time,people were between the ages of eighteen and eighty-five.\nArthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study.His team found that levels of stress were the highest among adults between the ages of twenty-two and twenty-five.Stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties.\nLevels of happiness were the highest among the kids and those in their early seventies.\nThe survey also found that men and women have similar emotional patterns as they grow older.However, women at all ages reported more sadness,stress and worry than men did.\nSo why would happiness increase with age? One theory is that,as people get older, they become more thankful for what they have and have better control of their emotions.They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences.", "id": "middle4959.txt"}
