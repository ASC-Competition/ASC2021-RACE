They can be as important as what you will do in the future or as simple as what you will eat for breakfast. Any decision could be the turning point of your life.\nI made an important decision when I was in Junior 3.\nBefore I made that decision I was one of the boys who tried too hard to act as an adult. I didn't know that only kids want to show themselves as adults.\nI didn't listen to my parents and teachers, and my grades became poor. Then came the high school entrance exam.\nAt the turning point of my life, my mom wanted to have a conversation with me. I wanted to turn it down but when I looked at her eyes, I felt I couldn't refuse. Instead of asking me to study hard, to my surprise, Mom just asked what I wanted to do in the future. Without thinking too much, I just said I would like to study hard.\nMom smiled and asked again: \"I asked: what do you WANT to do?\"\nI never seriously thought about the question. So, I kept silent.\n\"Whether you want to go on studying or enter the society,\" she went on, \"it is your own decision. Your life ought to be decided by you, not by anyone else, including me. \" After saying that, she had tears in her eyes.\nFor the first time in my life I was asked to make my own decision. I sat in my chair and thought about myself, my life and what kind of person I wanted to become.\nIt took me what seemed to be ages to make the biggest decision so far in my life--I wanted to be a man who makes a difference in the world. To achieve that, I needed to study hard.\nThe path to my future became clear to me. I didn't act rebelliously  any more. With passion   in my heart, I studied hard.\nNow, I'm 17 and I'm in one of the best schools in my city, in one of the best classes at the school and I am one of the best students in the class.\nThanks to that decision, I have become what I am today.", "id": "middle5980.txt"}
