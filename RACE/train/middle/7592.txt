When you read, you can not only learn some new words, but also learn how to use these English words. When you read, it gives you a good example for writing.\nGood reading tips:\nTry to read at the right level  . Read something that you can (more or less) understand. If you need to stop every three words to use a dictionary, it is not interesting.\nTry to increase   the number of your new words. If there are four or five new words on a page, write them in your notebook. But you don't have to write them while you read. Instead, try to guess their meanings as you read: mark   them with a pen. Then come back when you have finished reading to look them up in a dictionary and write them in your own vocabulary   book. Then try to remember them.\nTry to read regularly. For example, read for a short time once a day. Fifteen minutes every day is better than two hours every Sunday. Fix   a time to read and keep to it. You could read for fifteen minutes when you go to bed, or when you get up or at lunchtime.\nRead what interests you. Choose a book or a magazine about a subject that you like, because you are going to spend time and money reading it. So, choose an interesting book. You can also read newspapers. There are many English newspapers in China. For example, 21st Century Teens. It is easy enough for you to understand. There is something interesting in it.", "id": "middle7592.txt"}
