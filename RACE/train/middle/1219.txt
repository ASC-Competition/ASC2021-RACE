She by herself got up and down her bed, walked to the bedroom door and opened it. She looked outside and walked back, for it was so dark in the hall that she feared.\nHer mother said, \"Don't be afraid, honey. Take courage!\"\n\"What's courage?\" she asked, running to her mother's bed.\n\"Courage is the brave breath,\" her mother answered.\n\"Mum, do you have courage?\"\n\"Certainly.\"\nThe girl held out her little hands, saying, \"Mum, blow some of your breath of courage to me.\"\nAfter her mother blew out two mouthfuls of breath into her little cold hands, the little girl clenched her fists  nervously, afraid that the \"breath of courage\" would run away. Then with her fists clenched, she walked out of the bedroom towards the bathroom with nothing to fear.\nHer mother said to herself, \"It will be nice if someone can blow some kind of 'breath' to me. Then I can hold it in my hands too when I feel terrified or lost.\"\nIn fact, mostly, what we are terrified of is nothing but the fear in our mind. Who we should defeat  is nobody but ourselves.", "id": "middle1219.txt"}
