And one event made our visit seem truly magical.\nWe got to the front of the line at Space Mountain, only to find out that our little daughter Gloria\ncouldn't take her ice-cream on the ride. We were so excited that we all forgot ice-cream was not allowed on the ride.\nGloria broke into tears and we all had no idea what to do. Then Murphy, one of the staff  members, came over. She bent down and told Gloria that she would hold the ice-cream for her and give it to her when she finished the ride. Gloria said, \"Promise?\" Then she gave Murphy her ice-cream, and she completely enjoyed the ride.\nSure enough, as we walked out the exit, there was Gloria's new friend with \"her\" ice-cream.\nNow you and I both know what happened, because we know that an ice-cream won't last twenty minutes on a summer afternoon in Florida. Murphy knew what time we would get off the ride. she went to the nearest shop and bought a brand-new ice-cream thirty seconds before we walked out the exit. Gloria said, \"Thank you,\" but I'm sure she thought it was the same ice-cream.\nWe know that _ tried hard to make our visit special. Thanks so much for going above and beyond!\nYour fan,\nCarmen Rivera", "id": "middle2050.txt"}
