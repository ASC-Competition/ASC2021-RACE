As a result, we think we can see something that is not actually there or we ignore things that actually are there.\nScientists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris have researched this phenomenon , which they call \"change blindness\". Their experiments show how we sometimes just do not see what is in front of our eyes because _ .\nHere is one of their most famous experiments. In this experiment, the participants were shown a video of two groups of people (one group in white T-shirts and one group in black T-shirts) who passed basketballs around in a hallway. Each group had three members. Simons and Chabris asked the participants to count how many times the white team passed the ball. While the two teams were passing their balls around, a person dressed up as a big bear walked through the group and stopped to look at the camera. Simons and Chabris found that about half of the research participants did not notice the big bear.", "id": "middle5511.txt"}
