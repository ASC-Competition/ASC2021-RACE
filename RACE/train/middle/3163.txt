Chinese characters usually have more than one meaning and some of them are particularly loved by Chinese people.  Here are the top six lucky ones.  Please note we use \"pinyin\" here because \"pinyin\" is the Chinese spelling system for the characters. For example, \"fu\" is the \"pinyin\" for good luck in Chinese.  \"pinyin\" \"fu\" is only the phonic   ( )  part of the character and if you want to know the meaning of good luck \"fu\",  you must read the Chinese character because \"fu\" also represents     other Chinese characters that sound the same.\n1.  \"fu\" means blessing,  good fortune,  good luck. Chinese character \"fu\" is one of the most popular ones used during Chinese New Year. It is often displayed upside down on the front door of a house or an apartment.  The upside down\"fu\" means good luck comes since the character for upside down in Chinese sounds the same as the character for \"come\".\n2. \"Iu\" means prosperity.\nIt is used to mean official's salary( ) in feudal ( ) China.\n3.  \"shou\" means longevity.\nChinese character  \"shou\" also means life,  age or birthday.\n4. \"xi\" is happiness.\nThe doubled character \"xi\" means double happiness. It is usually displayed everywhere at Chinese weddings.\n5.  \"cai\" is wealth or money.\nChinese often say \"money can make a ghost turn a millstone\". It is to say money really can do a lot of things. But, still-money can't buy everything.\n6.  \"he\" means harmomous.\nPeople's harmony is an important part of Chinese culture. When you have harmomous\nrelations with others,   things will be a lot easier for you.", "id": "middle3163.txt"}
