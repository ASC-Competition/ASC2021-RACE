He is 12 years old. He likes playing football. He usually plays football with his friends at weekends.\nIvan lives with his father and mother in a city in France. They have a home with five rooms, a swimming pool and a garden. They often have a party in the garden at weekends. They like to help their neighbours. His home is not near his school, so Ivan takes a bus for an hour and then walks for 10 minutes to school. There is a Basketball Club near his school. He likes playing basketball in the club.\nIvan's father is a worker. He is busy. Ivan's mother is a doctor. She is nice to the patients. Ivan wants to be a teacher when he grows up. I want to be a teacher, too. Every month Ivan writes two letters to me. He'll come to China next year. We'll meet then.", "id": "middle6452.txt"}
