Players in every event, from spelling _ to golf, act in this way. It's all part of sportsmanship, a great tradition in sport and competition. It means playing and being calm all through the match.\nEveryone feels great when they win. In the last few years, you might see some players celebrate a goal with a long victory dance or talk big about their ability. However, it's always hard for people to say in public that they made a bad play. Good sportsmanship is what they really need. It's the golden rule of sports.\nGood sportsmanship means that you play by the rules, talk politely to everyone during games and stay cool even when you lose the game. At the school sports meeting, for example, it's more important for you to know how to work as part of a team and cheer your teammates on. That may help you enjoy more success at your future work. In competition--as in life--you may not always win, but believe me, sportsmanship will help you get through, and there is always the next match.\n,.", "id": "middle5.txt"}
