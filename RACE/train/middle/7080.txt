It said, \"Happiness is a direction, not a destination  .\" I had been having a bad day and just reading this brightened my day a little. I also took out a pen and wrote one of my favorite quotes   down. ww.szzx100.com\nWhen I came back to the fence, I saw another quote under mine in the handwriting as the first one. I added another, and we kept at this pattern for quite a while. One day, I was writing another quote on the fence and the old man, one of my neighbors, who owned the fence, saw me. He came out and I was afraid he would be mad at me for writing on his fence; he was not known to be very friendly. He gave me a sharp glance and then read the quotes on the fence. Without saying a word, he said something to himself and then went back inside. I was a bit terrified for a while, afraid to go back to the fence, but when I did, I noticed not more quotes but two words in entirely different handwriting had been added, \"Thank you.\"\nLater, I saw the old man in his front yard. He beckoned   me over and told me how my quotes had been inspiring him, how he thanked me and how he was glad to see young people still have \"values\". We are now good friend and I talk to him a lot. This experience has changed my life. I still don't know who wrote that very first quote, but if he is out there, I'd like to say \"thanks\" to that unknown friend.", "id": "middle7080.txt"}
