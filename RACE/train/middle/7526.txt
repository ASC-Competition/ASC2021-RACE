Man's present efforts cannot prevent it .Time is bringing us more people, and more people will bring us more industry, more cars, larger cities and the growing use of man-made materials.\nWhat can explain and solve this problem ?The fact is that pollution is caused by man ----by his desire  for a modern way of life. We make \"industrialization \"our main aim. So we seem to be ready to give up everything: clear air, pure water, good food, our health and the future of our children. Large numbers of people are moving from the countryside into the cities, looking forward to the modern life.
