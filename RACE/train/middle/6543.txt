It turns out to be the biggest mystery in modern aviation   history.\nIn the early hours of March 8, a Boeing 777 took off from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur  . It was heading to Beijing.\nBut about two hours into the flight, the plane lost contact. There were 239 people on board the Malaysia Airlines flight, including 154 Chinese.\nAbout 12 countries, including China, the US and Australia, have joined the search for the missing plane and passengers. The plane's disappearance was a \"mystery\", said officials. The plane was flying at a height of more than 10,000 meters when it suddenly lost contact. The weather was clear. The pilots didn't make any distress calls  . When a plane crashes, broken parts are usually recovered. But up to April 2, officials have not found anything.    People are also talking about a possible hijacking. Interpol   said that two people on the flight used stolen passports. But that information alone isn't evidence  of a hijack.\nThe investigation   is still going on. It could take months or even years to find out what happened to the flight.\n\"We are looking at all possibilities,\" said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein. \"The most important thing now is to find the plane.\"\nOn March 24 came a piece of sad news. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that the plane \"ended in the southern Indian Ocean\". Everyone on the plane died. But the mystery is still not solved. Nobody is giving up. China has said it will work hard to find out the truth at all costs.", "id": "middle6543.txt"}
