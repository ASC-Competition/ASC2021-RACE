What do you see?  Ads!  Turn on the TV. Still more ads!  Everywhere you look, someone has something to sell.\nHere are some ways ads get us to buy.\nSome ads use famous people. Stars are paid to sell a product. Think about it. Do they really know about medicine?  Do they know about soft drinks?  These people may be famous. But they may not know about what they are selling.\nSome ads make you think you're getting the words of experts . A man in a white coat comes on TV. He looks nice. \"I use White and Black, \" he says. This man looks like a doctor. But he is an actor. He has been paid to sell this product.\nDoes soap  have anything to do with a pretty child?  Not much. But ads may show their products with something nice, such as the sun, the flowers and so on.

Don't let their words and pictures fool you.\nuld not always believe the ads.", "id": "middle6996.txt"}
