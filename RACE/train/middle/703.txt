He loves to watch TV. But for one full year, he did not watch TV at all. What was the reason? Robert's parents said they would give him $500 if he didn't watch TV for a year.\nRobert's parents thought he watched too much TV. One day his mother saw a newspaper story about a boy who didn't watch TV for a year. She showed the story to Robert. \"It was a joke,\" his mother said, \"I didn't think he would do it.\" But Robert liked the idea. He turned off the TV right away. He said, \"It doesn't matter to me whether to watch TV or not. I just want the money.\"\nAt first, Robert's parents were very happy. Robert read the newspaper, played outside, played computer games, and played cards with his mother. But after a while, he got bored. Every evening, he asked his parents, \"What are we doing tonight?\" Sometimes his mother and father wished he would watch TV, just for one evening. Robert always said, \"No, it would cost me money!\"\nFinally the year was over. Then Robert started watching his favourite TV shows all day long again. Robert got the money from his parents. What does he plan to do with the $500? \"I want to buy myself a TV set!\" he said.", "id": "middle703.txt"}
