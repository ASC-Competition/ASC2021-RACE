Then how about a holiday in space?\nRecently, Russia has announced plans for a hotel in space. The dream of staying in space will soon come true.\nThe space hotel will open in2016. Experienced guides will go with tourists together. The food will be prepared on Earth and sent up on the rocket. When tourists want to eat, the food can be heated again in microwave ovens .One can have tea, water and fruit juices in the space hotel, but alcohol will not be allowed. Toilets will use flowing air instead of water to move waste, and waste water will be recycled. The hotel will be\"far more comfortable\"than the International Space Station(ISS,)used by astronauts. It will house seven guests in four cabins. Tourists there can enjoy the views of the Earth through huge windows. They may also meet unexpected  guests such as astronauts from the ISS, if those astronauts get in trouble.\nBut it's not easy to get to the hotel. It will take two days to send tourists there and a five-day stay will cost you 100,000 dollars.", "id": "middle6991.txt"}
