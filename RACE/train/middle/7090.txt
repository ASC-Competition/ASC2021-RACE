They put it in their car and drove to a park ranger   station.\nA ranger described the action of the tourists as a \"dangerous move\" because adult bisons can look after their babies very well and they will attack   to protect their young.\nPark rangers took the animal from the car and set it free. But, sadly, the baby was refused by its family because it had the smell from humans.\nYellowstone National Park explained on Facebook that the smell from people can cause parent animals to refuse to accept their young. The park tried again and again to make the baby bison lives with its parents. After several times they had to give up.\nMany people expressed anger at both the tourists and the park.\nThe park said that they did not have the ability to care for a young bison. They also said that it is \"not the task of the park to save animals\".\nThe tourists were fined   $110 for touching park wildlife. Park rules say that visitors to Yellowstone should stay at least 22 meters away from all wildlife, and at least 90 meters away from bears and wolves.\nOne ranger said that Yellowstone recently added many safety signs that say staying near the wildlife there is dangerous to humans and animals as well. Those signs are written in English and other languages.", "id": "middle7090.txt"}
