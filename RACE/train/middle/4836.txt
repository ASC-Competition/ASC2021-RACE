This process, which helps us to deal with culture shock , is the way our head and our personality react to(...) the strange new things we meet with when we move from one culture to another.\nCulture begins with the \"honeymoon stage\". This is the time when we first arrive in which everything about the new culture is strange and exciting. We see new things, hear new sounds and language, eat new kinds of food. This stage can last for quite a long time because we feel we are very excited.\nUnluckily, the second stage can be more difficult. After we have got used to our new life, we can become very tired and begin to miss our homeland and our family, friends, pets. All the little problems in life seem to be much bigger and more disturbing when you face them in a foreign culture. This time of cultural adjustment  can be very difficult and lead to pulling away from the new culture.\nThe third stage is called the \"adjustment stage\". This is when you begin to realize that things are not so bad in the host culture. Your sense of humor usually becomes stronger and you realize that you are becoming stronger by learning to take care of yourself in the new place. Things are still difficult, but you are now a survivor!\nThe fourth stage can be called \"at ease at last\". Now you feel quite comfortable in your new place. You can deal with most problems that you have. You may still have problems with the language, but you know you are strong enough to deal with them.\nThere is a fifth stage of culture shock which many people don't know about. This is called\n\"reverse culture shock\". Surprisingly, this happens when you go back to your own culture and find that you have changed and that things there have changed while you have been away. Now you feel a little uncomfortable back home. Life is a struggle!", "id": "middle4836.txt"}
