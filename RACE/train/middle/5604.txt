I'm now writing to ask you something about American social customs  . My American friends want me to join them in their dinner party. I am very happy and have decided to go, but I'm a little worried about it, too. The social customs in my country are very different from here, so I'm afraid of making mistakes.\nShould I bring a present, such as sweets or flowers? Should I arrive on time or a little late? At the dinner table, how can I know which fork   or knife to use? How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness?\nWang Lin\nLetter B\nDear Wang Lin,\nIt's a good idea to bring a small present when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always nice, or you may bring a bottle of wine   if you know that your friends drink it.\nYou should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you're going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them.\nTry to be free at the dinner table. If you don't know about choosing the right fork or knife, just watch the other people, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, ask the person next to you.\nIf you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank them for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a thank-you card the day after.\nRose", "id": "middle5604.txt"}
