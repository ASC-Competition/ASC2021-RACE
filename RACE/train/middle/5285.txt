Soon the city was covered with water. The rising water rushed into the cars on the roads. There were 16 deaths that weekend.\nChanging Weather\nThe weather is changing. Over the last few years, heavy rains have caused floods   in Brazil, Pakistan, and Thailand. Droughts   have struck Russia and Australia. Heat waves have killed thousands in Europe. There are more different kinds of terrible wild weather all over the world. In 2011 alone, the bad weather caused the world to lose 150 billion dollars.\nWarmer and Wetter\nAs more wild weather events happen, a worried world is beginning to ask questions like: What is going on with the weather? And why? Many also want to know: Is this natural, or are we to blame  ?\nThe answer seems to be: a little of both. Wild weather is natural. _ This global   warming makes heat waves more likely to happen. The higher temperatures also cause more water to enter the air. This causes much more rain. Some scientists also believe global warming makes some storms stronger.\nThis means we're likely to see more wild weather. \"But we don't have to just stand there and take it,\" says Scientist Michael Oppenheimer. He and other scientists say we need to stop the Earth from getting warmer. We also need to be prepared, to do things that will help save lives.", "id": "middle5285.txt"}
