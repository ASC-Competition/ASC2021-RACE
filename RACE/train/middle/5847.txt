Animals, such as dogs, cats, and even horses help sick children to get better.\nThere are many reasons why this treatment   is important. Dr. Marcus Finch of the Children's Hospital said, \"Children and teenagers have many changes as they are growing up. When they have problems, it is not easy for them to open up any talk. However, when they are with a pet animal, they calm down, relax, and smile. Animals do not speak and so they do not criticize  . They listen and they do not stop the children. Children can talk to animals because they can trust them. Animals know how to keep a secret! Also, the children feel needed because they help to feed the animals and look after them.\"\nAt the Children's Hospital, you can find children playing with cats, dogs, goats, and riding horses. The doctors just watch and take notes and wonder at the power of pets!", "id": "middle5847.txt"}
