It's going to be strange and new to him for some time. And I wish you would treat him gently.\nYou see, up to now, he has been king of his own room. He has been boss of the backyard. I have always been around to treat his wounds, and to comfort his feelings.\nBut now things are going to be different. This morning, he's going to walk down the front steps, wave his hand and start his life.\nSo, World, I wish you would take him by the little hand and teach him the things he will have to know. Teach him there are heroes, leaders and friends in this world. Give him quiet time to think over the mystery of birds in the sky, bees in the sun, and flowers on the green hill.\nTeach him to believe in his own ideas, even if everyone else tells him he is wrong.\nTeach him to stand and fight if he thinks he is right.\nTeach him never to put a price on his heart and spirit.\nTeach him gently, World, but don't love him too much, because only the test of fire makes fine steel. This is a big order, World, and see what you can do. He's such a little fellow.", "id": "middle2026.txt"}
