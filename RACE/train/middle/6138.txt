Different people have many different answers. It is strange enough that the same person may also have a different answer as time goes by.\nFive years ago when I was in Junior Grade One, I got interested in bicycling because I thought my uncle was very cool when he rode his bike. He could ride a bike with only one wheel. He could also sit on the bike and keep it standing straight, without moving for a long time.\nI thought it was easy to learn to ride a bike, so I decided to learn from my uncle. He told me how to ride. When I fell off the bike the first time, I was afraid to try again. It was too hard for me to learn. Then my uncle helped me by holding the bike for me and not to let go. With his help, I was able to ride longer and longer. \"You can do it by yourself now, young boy!\" I heard his voice far behind me.", "id": "middle6138.txt"}
