It was difficult enough just to raise money for their dance costumes  .  What were they going to do? As the team leader, Jenny felt she needed to come up with an idea. .\nAt lunch, Jenny found that a lot of students were throwing empty juice bottles in the rubbish. She remembered the school had a recycling   program a few years ago, but it had ended.  Nobody wanted to bring the bags of bottles to the recycling center.\nJenny saw a chance. She went to see the  headmaster.  \"If members of our team pick up the  recyclable bottles every few days, may we use the money we collect at the recycling center for our dance team?\" asked Jenny.\n\"I think that's a great idea, Jenny,\" said  Ms. Weaver.  \"But if another team wants to take over next season, I'll have to give them a chance, too. \" Jenny agreed that it was fair.
