A lot! On a clear night you can see the moon, some planets, and thousands of sparking stars.\nYou can see even more with a telescope. You might see that many stars look larger than others. You might see that some stars that look white are really red or blue. With bigger and bigger telescopes you can see more and more objects in the sky.
