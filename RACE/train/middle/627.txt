One evening there was a big dance at the hospital. Most of the doctors and nurses would be there, but it was Joan's turn to look after the sick children. She liked dancing very much, so she felt very sorry for herself.\nShe went to each sick child one after another and said good-night, until she came to one little boy, Dickey. He was eleven years old, but he was already able to talk like an adult( ). Poor Dickey had a very serious illness, and now he was hardly able to move any part of his body except his hands. Joan knew he would never get any better, but he was always happy and always thinking about other people instead of about himself.\nDickey knew that Joan loved dancing, so now when she came to say good-night to him, he greeted her with the words, \"I' m very sorry that you have to miss the dance because of us. But we are going to have a party for you. If you look in my drawer , you ' Il find a piece of cake. I saved it from my supper today, so it' s quite fresh. And there is also a dollar there, You can buy something to drink with that. And I' d get up and dance with you myself if I was able to,\" he added.\nSuddenly the hospital dance seemed very far away and not at all important to Joan.", "id": "middle627.txt"}
