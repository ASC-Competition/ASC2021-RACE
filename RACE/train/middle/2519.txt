For example, you can take aspirin   to get rid of   your headache. It is good to rest. and to drink a lot of water, too. A doctor once told me.\"With the right medicine. a cold will last for seven days. With no medicine, it will go on for a whole week!\"\nA long time ago, people understood that some plants made them feel better. For example, the juice of lemons   makes a sore throat feel better. In modern times, scientists have found out which chemicals   are in them. Man, of our medicines today are made from those chemicals. There are some diseases that we can't cure yet. And nobody has found a cure for old age. But because of modern medicines, the average people now live longer than their grandparents.", "id": "middle2519.txt"}
