Whatever they do, sometimes a wonderful, kind and helpful child will turn into a terrible animal.\nI've seen friends deal with _ in all kinds of different ways. One strict mother insisted that her son, should stand up, open doors and shake hands like a gentleman whenever anyone entered the room. I saw him last week when I visited them.
