Where did you? What happened to you?\nWhen we were together, we went shopping, flew kites, went swimming ... You bought me a T-shirt in a store. You helped me with my homework. And you made sandwiches for me. We also slept together every night. You never said you would leave me. I began to look for you when I found you left, but I failed.\nMom, thank you for teaching me so much. I hope to see you again. It's time for bed. I miss you!\nYours,\nJim", "id": "middle2542.txt"}
