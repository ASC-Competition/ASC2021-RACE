These stories are meant to have fun, but they are also used to teach important lessons to children. This is one of those stories.\nOne hot afternoon, Jackal was walking along the rocky road sniffing   the ground. He was hoping to smell a mouse or a lizard  , or something else that would be good to eat. He was so much lost in sniffing that he wasn't really paying attention to what was around himself.\nSuddenly, Jackal looked up to see his neighbor, Lion, walking straight toward him. He did not have enough time to run way. Jackal had played many tricks on Lion over the years, so he knew he would be in trouble if he was caught. Jackal needed to think of something quickly.\n\"Help! Help!\" cried Jackal as he quickly jumped upon a large rock hanging over the road. \"The rocks are falling down, and I can't hold them much longer. We shall both be crushed   if you do not do your best to hold these rocks back, Lion\"\nAt once, Lion pushed his strong shoulder against the rocks to keep them from moving any further. \"I'll just run over here to get something to stop the rocks.\" shouted Jackal as he ran way to safety. Lion stayed _ against the unmoving rocks for quite a long time before he realized that Jackal had tricked him yet again!", "id": "middle1890.txt"}
