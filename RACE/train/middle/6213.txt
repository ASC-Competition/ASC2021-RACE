But from goodbye moments, we can always learn something.\nOnce, I overheard   a father and daughter in their goodbye moment. The father said, \"I love you, I wish you enough.\" The daughter answered, \"Daddy, our life together has been more than enough. Your lover is all that I need. I wish you enough, too, Daddy.\"\nThey kissed and she left ...\nThe father walked over towards me. I could see he wanted and needed a cry. He came over to me and asked, \"Did you ever say a forever goodbye to someone?\" Before I could answer, he went on, \" I am old and she lives much too far away. I know her next trip back would be for my funeral  .\"\n\"When you were saying goodbye I heard you say, 'I wish you enough.' May I ask what that means?\"\nHe began to smile , \"It's a wish that has come down from my great-great-grandparents. And my parents used to say it to me.\"\nHe stopped for a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it. He smiled even more.\n\"When we said'I wish you enough,' we were wanting the other person to have a life full of enough good things.\"\nThen, turning towards me, he shared   the following \"wish\" from his heart.\nI wish you enough sun to keep you bright .\nI wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more.\nI wish you enough happiness to keep you alive.\nI wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life appear much bigger.\nI wish enough hellos to get you through the final goodbye.\nMy friends, I wish you enough.", "id": "middle6213.txt"}
