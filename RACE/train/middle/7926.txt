A while later they indeed saw mice running out, one after another. Then, everyone thought that all the mice had escaped. But just as they began to clean up, they saw two mice squeezing out at the mouth of the hole. With some efforts, the mice finally got out. However, it was strange that after they came out of the hole, they didn't run away immediately. Instead, one chased after the other near the mouth of the hole. It seemed that one was trying to bite the tail of the other.\nEveryone was puzzled , so they stepped near to take a look. They realized that one of the mice was blind and couldn't see anything, and the other was trying to allow the blind mouse to bite on his tail so that he could pull the blind one with him to escape.\nAfter seeing what happened, everyone was speechless and lost in thought. During the meal time, the group of people sat down in a circle and started to chat about what happened to the two mice.\nOne serious American official said, \"I think the relationship between those mice was that of king and guard .\" The other thought for a while and said, \"That is why!\"\nA smart Frenchman said, \"I think the relationship between those two mice was that of husband and wife.\" Again the others thought for a while, and all felt it made sense.\nA Japanese said, \"I think the relationship between those two mice was that of mother and son.\" Once again the others thought for a while, and felt this was more reasonable. So they expressed  agreement another time.\nAt that moment, one Chinese asked, \"Why did those two mice have to have a certain relationship?\"\nSuddenly, the group looked back at the Chinese and stayed speechless. The American official, the French and the Japanese who had spoken earlier all lowered their heads in shame , and did not dare to answer.\nIn fact, the true love is not built on friendship, loyalty  or blood relationship.\nInstead, it is based on no relationship.", "id": "middle7926.txt"}
