Not just friends, but strangers ,too.\nOnce, at the airport, my husband stepped off an escalator  before me. When he realized I wasn't with him, he looked back and saw me hugging ( ) a stranger.\nI'd asked the man behind me: \"Did you have fun in Vegas?\"\nHis answer broke me heart. After 50 years away, I'd come to say goodbye to the lover of his life, _ was dying of cancer.\n\"I should have married her 50 years ago,\" he said. I hugged him, and then he was gone.\nMoments later, my husband said: \"He told you all that on the escalator?\" I nodded.\n\"Maybe he just needed to tell somebody, And I happened to ask.\"\nWhen someone wants to talk, you just need to ask a question.

I can only hope her mother knew all the things her daughter wrote about her--that she was known so well and loved so much.\nI like to think people will say a few nice things about me when I'm gone. But given a choice, I would rather hear those things before I go. Wouldn't we all?\nThat started me thinking. I need to tell my children I am proud of them. They know it, but it can't hurt to say it again.\nI need to tell my sister I will forever in her debt . I was the one who left. She was the one who stayed, who's \"been there\" for our family--for our mother, our dad, our brothers and me.\nAnd to my husband, I need to say, well, he puts up with a lot.\nIn fact, I need to say a lot of things to whole lot of people. Maybe you do, too. You can tell me, if you want. But maybe you should tell them first.", "id": "middle5467.txt"}
