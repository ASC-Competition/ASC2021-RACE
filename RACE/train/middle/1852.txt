Its owner was an old man. He had been away for several years to visit his friends. It was a large lovely garden with soft green grass and beautiful flowers. While the old man was away, some children came to play in the garden every afternoon. The birds in the garden sang so sweetly that the children used to stop their games to listen to them. For them, the time they spent there was the happiest they had ever had.\nOne day the old man came back. When he saw the children playing in his garden, he was very angry. \"What are you doing here?\" he shouted. \"Nobody except myself is allowed to play in my garden.\" The children were terrified and ran away. Then spring came, but it was still winter in the old man's garden. There were blossoms   and birds all over the village, except in the garden. The birds didn't like singing in his garden, since there were no children.\" Why is spring arriving so late this year?\" the old man thought. \"How pretty it would be if it were spring now!\" One morning, the old man was woken up by some sounds. He heard birds singing and children laughing. When he opened the window, he saw the birds sitting in the trees and the children running about happily. \"I'm sure spring has come. What I'm seeing is the most _ scene   I have ever seen, and the sounds which I'm hearing are the most beautiful in the world,\" said the old man.", "id": "middle1852.txt"}
