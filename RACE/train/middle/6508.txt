I used to ask my mother for help. But she always said, \"Do it yourself, dear.\" or \"God helps those who help themselves , girl.\" I was not glad at all. I thought she was the laziest mother in the world.\nFor example, one day, I decided to invite some friends to my home. My bedroom was not in order. Books were everywhere. And I didn't make the bed. I asked my mother to help me to clean it, but she still said, \"Do it yourself, girl.\"\nBecause of my\"lazy mother\", I have to wash my clothes and clean my room. I have to help my parents do some housework. I even have to go to the dentist by myself. It is really hard for me to do everything well, but I have learned a lot.\nAs time goes by, I come to understand my mother. She makes me clever and active! What a great mother!", "id": "middle6508.txt"}
