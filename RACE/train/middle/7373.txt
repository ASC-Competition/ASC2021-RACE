Instead, they type  on computers. But scientists say that method is less helpful.\nIf you need to remember something, write it. Writing notes by hand is much better for long-term memory of idea. So, turn off your computer if you want to remember something.\nStudents who type notes on a keyboard often write down what the teacher says word-for-word. They may write without really thinking about what they are writing. These electronic notes contained  more words. But scientists say it leads to \" _ .\" Transcription means to write down something exactly as you hear it.\nHowever, students taking notes by writing them, need to first process the information they hear. Then they record just the main parts. They use fewer words. This is because people usually write slower than they type. This kind of process leads to a deeper understanding.\nThe scientists did a research. In the research, students listened to a teacher and then took a test. Some took notes by typing on a computer. The others took notes by writing them down.\nBoth groups performed about the same in remembering facts. But students who typed their notes did much worse on conceptual  questions. These questions required them to understand an idea.\nAlso, scientists found that those who wrote their notes remembered conceptual information better a week later. Scientists believe that the students who took notes by writing them had a deeper understanding of ideas.\nScientists know that students probably will still use their computers in class. But they suggest to take notes by hand on screens. They say this might be a good way between different schools.", "id": "middle7373.txt"}
