When they see me, they look so happy, because they know they will get to go outside, play with me and get lots of love from me.\n-----Mandy, 12\nEvery weekend, I go to an animal shelter to help. They have adoption events at pet stores. I help out by talking to people about animals, feeding animals and making sure the cages are clean. It makes me feel great when a cat or dog gets a new home.\n----Lucas, 11\nSometimes I do things for my neighbors and ask them to give me some money or clothes. Then I can give these to the unlucky people.\n----Linda, 10\nI love volunteering! Last week, I cleaned up the houses for people who couldn't do it themselves. I also made gifts for many women on Mother's Day. And I'll help the older people cook dinner next week. I love the feeling I get when the people smile and I know I made a difference in their life.\n----Megan, 13\nI volunteer at an after-school reading program. I help young children to learn how to read. My favorite part of it is seeing a little child feels excited when he or she learns a new word.\n----Victoria, 12", "id": "middle6862.txt"}
