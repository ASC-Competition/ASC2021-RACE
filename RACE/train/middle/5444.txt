As we were going out of the door, a young teenage boy was coming in. The boy had no hair on the sides of his head and some blue hair on top. He held a skateboard under one arm and a basketball under the other.\nCaitlin, who was walking in front of me, stopped when she saw the teen. I thought she'd be scared of him. I was WRONG. She backed up against the door and opened it as wide as it would go. I walked to the other side and let the boy pass. He said: \"Thank you very much.\"\nOn our way to the car, I talked with Caitlin about holding open the door for the boy. I wanted to make sure whether she was troubled by his appearance. But the only thing Caitlin noticed about the teen was the fact that his arms were full. \"He would have had a hard time to open the door.\"\nI saw the shaved   head and the blue hair. She saw a person carrying something under each arm and walking toward a closed door.\nIn the future, I hope to get on her level and raise my sights.", "id": "middle5444.txt"}
