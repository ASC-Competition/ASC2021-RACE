Ever since then I started thinking about how powerful the colour is, how it makes us look and how it makes us feel.\"\n\"When we wear clothes in a good colour, the colour will make our skin, hair and eyes shine and we look happy and smart,\" Kylie says.\nWinter and summer are \"cool colourings\" and autumn and spring are \"warm colourings\". Someone who loves \"cool colouring\" might have red or golden hair, brown eyes and gold or yellow skin.\nChinese women belong to the \"autumn season\" if they have darker, peachy skin. Chinese women belong to the \"winter season\" if they have pale skin. Kylie says that Chinese women who have dark eyes and dark hair will look best in deep, rich colours. Light pinks and blues should be  avoided because they may wash our Chinese skin tones .\nTheir talk usually lasts one and a half to two hours and costs 600 yuan (89 dollars). Kylie says her customers  are as young as five years old and as old as 90. The customers between their 30s and 50s always want some fresh ideas on developing their own personal style.", "id": "middle1846.txt"}
