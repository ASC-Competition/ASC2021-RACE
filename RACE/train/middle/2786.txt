Besides the earth, the \"red planet\" is seen, as the one place in our solar system most likely to have life.\nEarly last month, the first American robot, Spirit, landed on Mars without any problem. Opportunity, the second robot, landed on the planet more than a week ago. Scientists are very excited about these machines' safe landing on Mars. It means that now we have an excellent chance to look for water and other signs of life. So far, the robots have found some stones that could show Mars was once a wet and warm planet.\nBut the trips made by Spirit and Opportunity were dangerous. Mars is often called the \"death planet\", because in the past its environment has been unfriendly to the robot explorers. Before Spirit and Opportunity, nearly forty spaceships had been sent to Mars since the 1960s. Two-thirds of them failed. The first spaceship, Korabl, sent in 1962 by Russia was among them. It broke apart   near the earth.", "id": "middle2786.txt"}
