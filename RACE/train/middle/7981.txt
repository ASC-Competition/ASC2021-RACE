She pushed a black inner tube  in front of her. She had a worried look on her face because she had never floated down a river before.\n\"Let me hold your tube while you climb on,\" said her father. He smiled at her. \"There's not a cloud in the sky. It's a great day to be in the river, isn't it?\"\nRita looked out across the water. People were floating by on tubes. Some talked and laughed as they floated easily down the river. Others leaned  back with hats pulled over their faces. None of them looked terrified.\n\"We'll stay together,\" said Rita's father. \"I'll hold on to your rope .\"\n\"Will we go very fast?\" Rita asked.\n\"No,\" said Dad. \"We'll move slowly for a while, and then it will get a little faster near the river's bend . Don't worry, Rita. You'll be fine.\"\nRita looked at her tube. It gently  moved up and down in the water. She saw a girl of her own age float by. The girl seemed to be having fun. Suddenly Rita's worries disappeared .\n\"I'm ready to climb on and ride, Dad,\" she said.", "id": "middle7981.txt"}
