With so much homework, it's often difficult to get the rest you need. But you need to try, because sleep keeps you healthy and it stops you getting fat.\nRecently, a group of US scientists did a study of kids aged between 8 and 13. The studt found that if kids sleep for just one extra hour each day, the chance of their getting fat is cut by about 30%.\nWhy? When people don't get enough sleep, they become tired. When they are tired, they don't exercise enough. Also, kids like snacks. If they are awake an extra hour or two each day, they have more time to eat snacks or other unhealthy foods.\nSo, how much sleep should you get? Scientists suggest 10 to 11 hours a night for kids aged 5 to 12. For older kids, eight to nine hours will do.", "id": "middle6950.txt"}
