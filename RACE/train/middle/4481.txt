Every year water sports, especially surfing and water skiing attract many tourists to the island.\nHawaii has been a magical name to people who like to travel for many years. People on both sides of the Pacific Ocean  in Japan and in America, dream of seeing these beautiful islands in the middle of the ocean. In the tropical  lands, the sun drops like a ball of golden glow  that light the sky in the quiet water.\nPeople often have a quiet, enjoyable time walking along the water. The scenery here is not very different from the exciting beauty that greeted the first tourists to these islands centuries ago. They came in canoes not much bigger than small boats.\nThey found the beautiful white sand beaches and the waving palm trees , but there were no grand hotels like the ones we see today. The first people came to Hawaii nearly two thousand years ago, but skyscraper  hotels were only built in the last 25 years. Now planes make it possible to fly to Hawaii for a weekend from Tokyo or San Francisco.\nNo matter where people come from, they really want to see the earliest beauty of Hawaii. They want to see the lovely beaches and the mountains which are almost hidden by the tall hotels.", "id": "middle4481.txt"}
