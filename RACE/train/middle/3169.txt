If you live near a water park, you might think about getting a season pass. This way you can go as often as you like.\nCheck to see if there are any water parks around you. Many are indoor facilities. So even if it isn't warm enough where you live to swim outdoors, you can enjoy swimming in a temperature controlled area.\nThe prices are usually good. For example, one ticket to Water World, a water park, is only $5.\nSome teens like to get a part time job over the summer to make some pocket money. Older teens shouldn't have much trouble finding jobs.\nAn idea is to get some teens together to form your own summer job business. You can walk dogs, bring in the newspapers, feed the cats, collect rubbish, water flowers, etc.\nBeing that it's summer, many people go on vacation and could use someone to look after their houses while they're away. You can also think about other jobs you can do for them.\nTeens love freedom. Sure you would like to get to such places as the small, movie theaters, the zoo, the beach, picnic, bowling and local amusement park instead of staying home all summer. Then a summer bus pass will be helpful. Check to see if your area has one for you teens.\nSuch a pass costs only $10 for the whole summer. The price is reasonable  and also your parents don't have to always drive.", "id": "middle3169.txt"}
