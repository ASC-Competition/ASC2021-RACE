In summer, it's very hot. It's usually sunny, but it often rains. So people often take a pair of sunglasses and a raincoat at the same time. People can enjoy many kinds of fruits like bananas and coconuts there, too.\nHainan is a good place to go for holidays and have fun. People can go fishing, boating, swimming and so on.
