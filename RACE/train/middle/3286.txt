More than one in ten adults said they regularly won't say thank you if they are in a bad mood. Most people stated that saying thank you was something that their parents trained them. A huge 70 percent of those questioned will say thank you to a person's face without even meaning it, while one fifth avoid saying it when they know they should.\nIt seems our friends and family get the stress of our bad manners. Half of them admit   they're not good at thanking those closest to them. Many of them explain that they don't say thank you because their family \"already know I'm grateful\".\nWhen spoken words won't do, it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people.\nOne third will still send a handwritten thank-you note---but 45 percent admit it's been more than six months since they tried to send one.\nA quarter of British people say \"thank you\" with food, with 23 percent cooking a meal to show their appreciation to someone. Another 15 percent bake a cake.\nIt follows that 85 percent of people will be angry because of not getting the gratitude  they feel they should receive.", "id": "middle3286.txt"}
