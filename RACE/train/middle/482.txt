This is obvious .\nThere are two ways to get correct English sentences: listening and reading. Both are good, but reading is much easier than listening. With the help of a good dictionary, you will be able to understand English texts much more easily than movies. If you just read one book in English, you will see that your English has become much better. English phrases will just come to you without thinking when you are writing or speaking.\nThis is true for hundreds of words and grammar structures . If you read in English, you can forget about grammar rules. Throw away your grammar book! You needn't know the rules for the present perfect tense .
