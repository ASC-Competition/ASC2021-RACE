Ears are for hearing, skin is for feeling and noses are for smelling. Would anyone say that ears can smell, or that tongues can see? Actually, yes. Paul Bach-y-Rita, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, believes that the senses can changeable. For example, a tongue can be used for seeing. The brain, as we know, is a complex organ . Even when part of it is hurt, it will try to carry out the same function by sending the function to another area of the brain.\nA college student was asked to take part in an experiment. In the experiment, his eyes were covered with a small video camera. The camera was connected to a long plastic line which went into his mouth. A computer would change the video's picture. The picture would travel through the plastic line as an electric current , reaching the electrodes  inside the student's mouth. The scientist would roll a ball towards his right side, left side, or centre, and the student would have to catch it. When the scientist rolled the ball, pain passed over the student's tongue. For the position of the pain on the tongue, the student reached out his hand and caught the ball.\nIf the brain can see a ball through a camera and a wet tongue, blindness and deafness can be overcame.", "id": "middle5977.txt"}
