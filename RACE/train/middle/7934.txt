Everything went wrong. First, I slept late and Mom shouted at me to wake up. When I went to the kitchen for breakfast, there was no cereal. I decided to have some toast instead, but I burned it. I had to eat it anyway because there was no more bread. The juice bottle was empty, so I had a glass of cold water.\nWhen I was getting on a bus, I realized that I had forgotten my wallet, so I had to go back home to get it.\nOf course, I missed the bus and had to wait for the next.\nI was late for school and the teacher told me to stay in the classroom at lunchtime to catch up on  the school work I had missed. After lunch, it was time to give the teacher our homework. I reached into my bag to get it, but it wasn't there. I had left it at home. I was in trouble again.\nWhen I got home, I went straight to my room to catch up on my homework. Mom cooked fish for dinner. She knows I don't like fish, but she thinks it is good for her son. How terrible! I hope tomorrow will be better.", "id": "middle7934.txt"}
