Normally the women's brain weighs 10% less than men's. Since research has shown that the bigger the brain, the cleverer the animal, men must be more intelligent  than women. Right? Wrong. Men and women always score similarly on intelligence tests, despite the difference in brain size. Why? After years of study, researchers have concluded that it's what's inside that matters, not just the size of the brain. The brain is made up of \"grey matter\" and \"white matter\". While men have more of the white matter, the amount of \"thinking\" brain is almost the same in both men and women.\nIt has been suggested that smaller brain appears to work faster, perhaps because the two sides of the brain are better connected in women. This means that little girls may learn to speak earlier, and that women can understand sorts of different information at the same time. When it comes to talking to the boss on the phone, cooking dinner and keeping an eye on the baby all at the same time, it's women who come out on top every time.\nThere are other important differences between two sexes . As white matter is the key to spatial tasks, men know better where things are in relation to other things. \"A great footballer always knows where he is in relation to the other players, and he knows where to go,\" says one researcher. That may explain one of life's great mysteries: why men refuse to ask for directions ... and women often need to!\nThe differences begin when fetuses are about nine weeks old, which can be seen in the action of children when they are very young. A boy would try to climb a barrier before him or push it down while a girl would ask for help from others. These brain differences also explain the fact that more men take up jobs that require good spatial skills, while more women speech skills. It may all go back to our ancestors, among whom women needed speech skills to take care of their babies and men needed spatial skills to hunt, according to one research.", "id": "middle1746.txt"}
