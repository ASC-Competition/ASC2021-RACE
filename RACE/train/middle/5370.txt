One day, a young man went to an interview for a job as a Morse code operator .\nAnswering the ad in the newspaper, he went to the office address. When he arrived, he walked into a large, busy office filled with noise, including the sound of the telegraph. An office worker asked him to wait until he was called to go into the inner office. Seven other people were already in the waiting area for the interview. The young man sat down and waited with them. After a few minutes, the young man stood up, crossed the room to the door of the inner office, and walked right in. Naturally the other people wondered what was going on. They were sure that the young man made a mistake and would be refused.\nA few minutes later, however, the boss came out of the inner office with the young man and said to the other people,\"Gentlemen,thank you very much for coming, but the young man has got the job.\"\nThe other people were surprised, and one of them said, \"Wait a minute. I don't understand. He was the last to come in, and we never even got a chance to be interviewed. Yet he got the job. That's not fair!\"\nThe boss said, \"I'm sorry, but all the time you've been sitting here, the telegraph has been sending out the following message in Mores code: 'If you understand this message, then come right in. The job is yours.' None of you heard it or understood it. This young man did. The job is this.\"", "id": "middle5370.txt"}
