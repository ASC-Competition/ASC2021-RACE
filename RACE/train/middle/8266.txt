We study at the same school. At weekends he usually turns on his computer. He sends and gets e-mails to and from his friends back in France. He also gets on the Internet to learn about what is going on in the world. His parents sometimes take him to some places of interest in China. Sometimes I ask him to come over to my home for a weekend. My parents say that they can't understand what we talk about because there are two languages in our talks--Chinese and English. My mother sometimes says to him,\"Can you talk to my son in Chinese only,Wade?\" He always smiles and answers, \"Not today. I'm going to speak good Chinese very soon.\" He is not good at Chinese and I am weak at English. But we like these talks because we can learn when we are talking.", "id": "middle8266.txt"}
