He said he was in a hurry because he had an appointment at 9 am.\nWhile taking care of his finger I asked him if he had another doctor's appointment this morning, as he was in such a hurry. The old man told me no, that he needed to go to the nursing home to have breakfast with his wife. I asked if she would be unhappy if he was a bit late. He replied that there was something wrong with his wife's mind and she hadn't known who he was since five years ago.\nI was surprised, and asked him, \"And you still go every morning, even though she doesn't know who you are?\"\nHe smiled to me and said, \"She doesn't know me, but I still know who she is.\"", "id": "middle8230.txt"}
