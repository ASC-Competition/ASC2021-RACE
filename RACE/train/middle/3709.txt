It was an eccentric  farmer. I had never met him before although I had often heard people talk about him. He sounded quite nervous and he had been talking for a minute or so before I understood anything. Even then I could _ that someone called Milly had had a very bad accident. I hadn't the slightest  idea who she was but I obviously had to go.\nIt had been snowing so heavily that I didn't know the way. I had been driving for at least an hour when I finally found his place. He was standing there, waiting for me. It seemed Milly had died. \"She meant more to me than anyone... even my own wife!\" he said. I could see that he had been crying.

I was even more shocked when he told me he had put her in the barn. \"I wouldn't leave her out in the cold!\" he said.\nMilly had clearly been a secret lover of his.
