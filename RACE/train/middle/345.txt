He must change his reading speed to fit what he is reading and what he is reading for, just as a driver does to fit the road situation.\nA good reader may read at 1,000 WPM(... )when he looks for something for a report in the library. But once he finds what he needs, he may slow down to 100 WPM. A good reader may read newspapers and story books at 600 WPM. But he may read his science or maths books at 150 WPM.
