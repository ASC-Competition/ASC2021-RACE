It is a chance to see your friends again. But most exciting of all, the new term is a chance to take up new hobbies. It is common in Britain for students to take up new hobbies after the Christmas holidays. Deciding to start something new is a common New Year plan.\nMost schools provide different kinds of hobby classes. Students take them in their free periods or after school. Some classes you have to pay for and others are free. For example, I once took a free Wednesday evening gymnastics   class in my school. But when I learnt how to play the drum  my parents had to pay for the lessons.\nThe most popular hobby classes at my school were piano lessons and drama club. Both classes offered exams students could take. Students with many hobbies sometimes felt more stressed than those without any.

My best friend today is someone I met in my gymnastics class.", "id": "middle6529.txt"}
