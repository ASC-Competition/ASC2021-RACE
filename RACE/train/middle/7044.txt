So, the world became his school. With great interest, he read everything he could, listened to the town elders and learned about the world beyond his hometown. \"There's so much to learn,\" he'd say. \"Though we're born stupid, only the stupid remain that way.\" He decided that none of his children would be refused an education.\nTherefore, Stanley insisted that we should learn at least one new thing each day. Though, as children, we thought this was crazy, we'd still do _ . And dinner time seemed perfect for sharing what we learned. We would talk about the news of the day. Sometimes the news was unimportant, but it was always taken seriously. Stanley would listen carefully and discuss it with us.\nThen came the moment--the time to share the day's new learning.\n\"Felice,\" he'd say, \"tell me what you learned today.\"\n\"I learned that the population of Denmark is ....\"\nSilence.\nStanley was thinking about what was said. \"The population of Denmark. Hmm. Well...\" he'd say. \"Get the map; let's see where Denmark is.\" And the whole family went on a search for Denmark.\nThis same experience was repeated until each family member had a turn. Dinner ended only after we had a clear understanding of at least half a dozen such facts.\nAs children, we thought very little about these educational wonders. Our family, however, was growing together, sharing experiences and joining in one another's education. And by looking at us, listening to us, respecting what we learned, confirming our value, Stanley was surely our most influential teacher.\nLater during my training as a future teacher, I studied with some of the most famous educators. They were imparting  what Stanley knew all along--the value of continual learning. His skills have served me well all my life. Not a single day has been wasted, though I can never tell when knowing the population of Denmark might prove useful.", "id": "middle7044.txt"}
