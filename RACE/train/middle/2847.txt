Your time in junior high school will come to an end in a few months. Let's look back over the last three years. What were the highs and lows?\nFor Zhang Xiaomeng, a senior high school girl from Jiangsu, meeting her best friend Hua Xuan was the best part of her time at junior high school. They went to class together, had lunch together, and even went to the washroom together. Having one or two best friends is important, said Xu Zheng, a teacher from Jiangsu. \"Students have secrets. They don't want to tell their parents,\"Xu added. However, being too rebellious   in junior high is the biggest _ for Liu Anqing, a senior high school student from Fujian. \"I didn't listen to my parents. I quarreled with my mother every week,\" said Liu. \"I wish I could go back to that time and get on well with them.\" Time also needs to be taken care of. Zhang Zihua, 15, from Shanxi, thought he had plenty of time to prepare for the big exam at the end of Junior 3. Then one day, he was told: \"The exam is in 100 days.\" \"We need a strong knowledge base to pass the exam. But I didn't care about it,\" said Zhang. Gu Xiaoli, a teacher from Jiangsu, said that it's never too late to catch up. \"No matter your regrets about wasted time, you can always pick things up from now,\" said Gu.", "id": "middle2847.txt"}
