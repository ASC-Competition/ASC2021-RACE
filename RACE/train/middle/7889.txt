His family didn't know that he had a problem. They kept on skiing. When they got to the foot of the mountain, there was no sign of Jake.\nJake couldn't find his ski anywhere. In the end, he decided to take off his other ski and walk down the mountain. But he couldn't work out the right way to go.\nIt was now getting dark and he was a long way from any place of safety. He knew that he might die that night in the cold temperatures. But Jake kept calm. At home, Jake watched a lot of programmes about living in difficult situations. He remembered the advice from these programmes and knew that he should build a hole in the snow. He made a hole so the wind couldn't blow into it. Outside his hole, the temperature fell to a dangerous -15degC that night, but inside it Jake was safe from the cold.\nAfter the long evening passed, Jake began to think his way out. He had to get down the mountain. The TV programmes always said, \"If you are lost, you should find someone else's tracks  through the snow and follow them.\" \"I wanted to live my life.\" remembered Jake, \"So I got up and I found some ski tracks and I followed those.\" He walked and walked and finally saw lights...\nHis mum was very happy when she heard her son was saved. Amazingly, Jake didn't even have to go to hospital. He got through the terrible experience without any injuries.\nSo, the next time someone says that watching TV is a waste of time, think of Jake. Sometimes TV can save your life!\n.", "id": "middle7889.txt"}
