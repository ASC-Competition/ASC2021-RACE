He became old and didn't want to deal with big things anymore. So he began to look for someone to take his place. But who could he trust for the job? He thought for a while and got an idea. He would let the flowers decide. He gave everyone a little seed  . The one who could grow the most beautiful flower from the seed would be the next leader.\nA girl called Serena was very beautiful and wanted to grow the most beautiful flower. She planted it in a nice pot and took great care of it, but nothing would grow.\nThe next year she saw everyone come to the palace with pots full of beautiful flowers. She was disappointed but also went to the meeting with her empty pot. The king looked through all the flowerpots and then stopped at hers.\n\"Why is your pot empty?\" he asked.\n\"Your Majesty  , I did everything to make it grow, but I have failed,\" she answered.\n\"No, you didn't,\" he said.\n\"You see, the seeds I've _ were all roasted  , so nothing could come out of them. I have no idea where all these flowers come from. But you have been honest and by being so, you will become my successor  .\"", "id": "middle2136.txt"}
