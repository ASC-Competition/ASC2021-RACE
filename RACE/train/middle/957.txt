He was born in America in 1899. His father was a doctor and loved sports very much, and his mother taught music. Among the six children in the family, Hemingway was the second oldest.\nHemingway had written many books in his life. The Old Man and the Sea is one of the most famous and also my favourite. It came out in 1952. The main character in the book is a fisherman. He is an old man and fishes alone. People think he is a man with bad luck, because he doesn't get a fish in eighty-four days. Every evening, he comes home with his empty boat. But the old man believes himself. Then on the eighty-fifth day the man takes a big fish. Although he meets a lot of trouble, the old man never gives up .\n,.", "id": "middle957.txt"}
