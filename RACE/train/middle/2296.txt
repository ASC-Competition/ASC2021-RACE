Wen talked with many children and asked them many questions about their schooling and life.\n\"You are so pretty,\" Wen said to Liu Mengqi, a seven-year-old girl living with her grandmother.

The children shook their heads.\n\"Children cannot see their parents very often, which is a new problem in the country-side.
