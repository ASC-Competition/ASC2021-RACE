I joined a club called \"Passing help\" last month. Now let me tell you why I joined it.\nOne evening this May, on my way home my old car broke down. It was 25 miles from my home. I wanted to _ in somebody else's car, but it was dark and there was no car. It was also hard to take a taxi. I decided to take a bus home. I went to a bus stop nearby.\nAfter a while, a bus came ,but it did not go to my town. The bus driver was a young woman. She was kind and she told me which bus I should take. I waited there for about thirty minutes, but no bus came . At last a car came to me and a woman came out of the car. She was just the bus driver.\n\" When I reached the bus station. I got to know that the bus to your town couldn't come, so I returned here. I just can't leave you here,\" she said .\"Get in my car and I will take you back to your home.\"\n\"It is a long way,\" I said.\n\"Come on, sir,\" she said.\"Let's go.\"\nOn the way she told me a story. A few days ago. There wasn't gas  in her car. An old man drove her up to a gas station and then back to her car.\nWhen we got to my home ,I wanted to give her some money to thank her, but she didn't accept it. \" I only want to help others and do something nice for somebody. Pass it along.\" She said.", "id": "middle4185.txt"}
