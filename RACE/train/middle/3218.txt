Leila waited. Then she pushed the button on her camera. \"And I got my best photo of an elephant ever, by lying under my car,\" Leila explained. \"I wanted to get close to the elephants, but of course this was dangerous; they had their babies with them. So every morning I used to park my car in the open near the path  . They used to take the same path every morning when they left the water hole. After a week, they were used to seeing my car. So the next morning, I lay under it and got my photo!\"\nMany of the best wildlife photos come from good planning. In Africa, photographers set up their hides   near water holes. They also set up hides near forest paths, as animals use the same paths every night. For bird-watching, many lakes have hides. Inside the hides, bird-watchers can watch all day in the shade   out of the wind and rain.\nGood wildlife photos are needed for books, postcards, magazines and newspapers. But a success rate of 1 in 20 is good.", "id": "middle3218.txt"}
