And in December, a single _ killed more than 2000 people in the Philippines. Sending workers to stabilize mountainsides using steel bars can help a lot, but it introduces new difficulties because of dust and loosen heavy, dangerous debris from the work. \"It's a quite dangerous job,\" says Giorgio Pezzuto of D' Appolonia, working with eight other companies. Now there may be an answer: a three-ton robot called Roboclimber.\n\"The idea is to operate a machine far away that can do the stabilizing job without a human being near,\"says Pezzuto, manager for the project, which is supported by a European organization. Engineers say that the machine will be faster and cheaper than manual labor. The robot, a large radio-controlled four-legged spider, has cost at least $2 million so far. It should be able to climb mountainsides, drill holes and insert steel bars there. Testing should begin in May.", "id": "middle675.txt"}
