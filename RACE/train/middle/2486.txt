So, I really doubted whether there was any love between my parents. Every day they were working hard to pay for my high school. They didn't act in the romantic ways that I read in books and saw on TV, and they certainly didn't send flowers to each other on Valentine's Day  .\nOne day, my mother was sewing a quilt  . I asked her if there was any love between her and my dad. She stopped and raised her head in surprise. Then she went on with her work without saying anything. I was very worried because I thought I had hurt her feelings. But after a few minutes she said, \"Look at this thread  . Sometimes it appears, but most of the time it disappears in the quilt. If life is a quilt, then love is the thread. It can hardly be seen anywhere or at any time, but it's really there, and makes the quilt long-lasting.\" I listened carefully but I didn't understand her until the next spring.\nMy mother suddenly got seriously ill and had to stay in hospital for about a month. Every morning and evening after she returned from the hospital, my father helped her walk slowly along our country road. _ All of this made the most beautiful picture in the world. Reading their eyes, I knew they love each other deeply. From this experience, I realized that love is just a thread in the quilt of our lives. Love is inside, making life strong and warm.", "id": "middle2486.txt"}
