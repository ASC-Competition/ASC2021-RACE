What are they doing when I call them? Dad works from seven o'clock in the morning to nine o'clock in the evening. My mum does all the housework, she also has to work in the field. But I can't do anything for them.\nEvery day she gets up at around 4 o'clock in the morning. When I sometimes call her at 7:30 in the evening, she tells me that she is still in the field and doesn't have supper. I tell her I'll study hard in the school. I also ask her to take care of herself and dad because I can't live without them.\nMum says that the happiest time for dad and her is when my sister and I come back home.\nWe play cards in the room, watch TV, or do anything we like, with dad and mum making delicious food in the kitchen. It is also the happiest time for me.\nLove, sometimes, doesn't need many words. Love your parents like they love you. Give them a call, tell them you miss them.", "id": "middle2478.txt"}
