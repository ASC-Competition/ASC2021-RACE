The students in each class were divided  into some groups. Each group sold different kinds of foods. The students did the shopping and the cooking all by themselves. The students cooked delicious food such as fried chicken, potato chips and vegetables. They all worked hard and sold the food at low prices. The customers  were all the students, teachers and parents. They were all pleased with the nice food.\n\"It's really hard work,\" said one of the students who took part in the activity. \"We must make a plan before the cooking. We must know how much we should spend on the things we need. Also, we must learn how to serve customers well.\"\n\"This activity is to give a chance to students to develop  their practical abilities ,\" said one teacher, \"What's more, the students will not only learn how to make money by their own hands, but also know the meaning of life. \"", "id": "middle906.txt"}
