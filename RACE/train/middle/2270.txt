All I need is my nose. When I wake up in the morning and smell the tasty treats my mom is cooking downstairs, I know winter has arrived.\nThe first one is the smell of chocolate. During the holiday season (from Thanksgiving to New Year's Day) my mother makes her special hot chocolate. She always adds a peppermint candy cane   to the drink and tops it with cream.\nThe hot chocolate gets me out of bed, but it is my mother's chocolate fudge   that makes me run downstairs. It is a thick chunk   of chocolate that tastes like heaven. My mother adds nuts. That gives it more texture  .\nBut my mother isn't done yet. She also makes a treat she calls \"window panes  \". She takes a few different colored marshmallows   and melts them together with chocolate. The final product looks like a colorful church window, so we call it \"window panes\".\nThese tasty holiday treats are usually eaten after a meal as a dessert. But don't tell Santa Claus because I secretly eat them all day long.", "id": "middle2270.txt"}
