If you want to _ it, you have to spend a long time and walk slower to enjoy yourself. Copenhagen was the first city to have a street for walkers only. The city has less traffic noise and pollution than any other European capital.\nWalking along the river banks, you'll see the Amalienborg Palace first. The king's family is living there.\nChurches and castles show us the original city. Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in 1445. But fires in 1728 and 1795 completely destroyed  the old wooden buildings. Much of what we see today dates back to  the 19th and early 20th centuries.\nKeep going, and you'll see the Christiansborg Palace. The town of Copenhagen began there. The you'll see Nyhavn ,a waterway, which was dug in 1673. When you see it, you'll understand why Hans Christian Andersen made this beautiful waterway his home. Nyhavn is a peaceful and wonderful place. You'll usually see some rich people walk along here.\nIf you walk there, you can enjoy the old trees, the colorful lights and the beautiful gardens. You might feel as if you were in a fairy tale.", "id": "middle7300.txt"}
