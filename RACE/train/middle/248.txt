I was a hardworking student and I did well in all the subjects. I finished the questions successfully until I read the last one: \"What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?\"\nOf course this was a joke. I saw the cleaning woman every day. She is short and about 60 years old. She has dark hair. But how would I know her name? I had never talked with her before. In fact, I'd never even thought about talking to her. I stared at my paper and started to feel rather guilty. Finally, I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank.\nBefore the class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our grades.\n\"Absolutely,\" the teacher said. \"In your life, you will meet many people. All are important. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is to smile and to say hello.\"\nI've never forgotten that lesson. Everyone deserves my attention and I should get to know all of the people who work and live around me. That was, perhaps, the most important lesson of my life. I also learned the cleaning woman's name was Dorothy.", "id": "middle248.txt"}
