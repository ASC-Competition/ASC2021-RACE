That's because they don't find the right way. I think reading is very important for students. The more you read, the better you'll understand.\nReading is helpful to listening, speaking and writing. If you often read English aloud, you'll improve your listening. On the other hand, listening a lot can help you to read better. Reading English everywhere when you are free, if you wish. You can get a lot of knowledge when you read. Sometimes you need to express your ideas, you can either speak or write. That means you are using what you learned from reading. The same as Chinese, the more you read, the better you can write. If you want to remember something, you should read again and again.\nSo from now on, you'd better do more reading. It's a good way to learn English well.", "id": "middle2063.txt"}
