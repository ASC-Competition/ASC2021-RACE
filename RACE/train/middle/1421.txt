The things in their rooms, such as the television, the computer, the fridge, furniture and so on, were all left by their parents. They only paid some money for their food and clothes. But they tried their best to save money. If they had something important to tell their friends, they always visited them instead of calling them.\nOne day, it was a quarter past nine. Mr. Beet didn't come back. His wife was a little worried. The supper was cold and she had waited for two hours. She was sitting by the table in the dark room.\nSuddenly the woman heard someone coming upstairs. It was her husband's step. She hurried to open the door. In the dark she could hear his deep breathing . As soon as he sat down, she turned on the light and found he looked very tired.\n\"Why do you come back so late, dear?\" asked the woman. \"Haven't you caught a bus?\"\n\"Yes, but I didn't take it.\" \"Why not?\"\n\"I ran after it so that I saved two dollars this evening.\"\n\"That's great!\" the woman said happily. \"Run after a taxi next time and you'll save both more time and money.\"", "id": "middle1421.txt"}
