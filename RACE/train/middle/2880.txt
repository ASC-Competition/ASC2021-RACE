Cats won't die if they fall off very high places because they can turn themselves up the right way so as to keep their bodies safe. One cat fell off 32 floors onto the street, but it was just hurt a little. A bear can run as fast as a horse.  A new-born panda is smaller than a mouse and weighs about 100 grams.  Elephants are the most careful animals in their love. A male  elephant may show his lady love for up to three years until the female  elephant takes his love. They often show their love by touching each other's body. Usually, wolves do not hurt people.
