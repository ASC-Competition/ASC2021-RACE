Do you know the signs are an important part of our daily life? They can be in pictures or in words to give people information. What do people think are good signs? If you are thinking about making signs for others, what should you know?\nThe most important thing is that signs should be simple and easy to understand. It is important to use clear language. On the other hand, the words should be easy to write and you just need to write down what you want to do. \"Keep off the grass\" is a very good example. It means \"Don't touch or walk on the grass\".\nNowadays, there is a saying that \"A picture paints a thousand words\". Perhaps that's why we are seeing more and more signs in pictures, or a combination   of pictures and words.
