Money and success alone do not bring lasting happiness. Aristotle, a Greek thinker, said, \"Happiness depends upon ourselves.\" In other words, we make our own happiness.\nHere are a few suggestions to help you be happier.\nThe first secret of happiness is to enjoy the simple things in life. Too often, we spend so much time thinking about the future --for example, getting into college or getting a good job --that we fail to enjoy the present. You should enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or spending time with close friends. People who have several close friends often live happier and healthier lives.\nAnother secret to living a happy life is to be active, and have hobbies where you forget your problems and time. Many people experience this dancing, or playing a sport, such as swimming. You can forget about your problems, and only think about the activity.\nFinally, many people find happiness in helping others. Studies show that people feel good when they spend their time helping others. If you want to feel happier, do good things for someone. You can help a friend with his or her studies, go shopping to buy food for an elderly person, or simply help out around the house by washing the dishes.\n,", "id": "middle2555.txt"}
