Go to get your passport and start your adventure( ). \"\nSo I did.\nSince I was a little kid I was dreaming to know Europe. So next day I had my passport.

But Europe in winter is really cheap.\nI packed some books, a camera, 4 shirts, 2 pants, a coat, gloves, 2 pairs of walking shoes, candies and music to give away.\nI had little money.  I just walked and walked.  I went to high mountains and big cities.\nsaw some beautiful sunsets . I heard some of the best musicians (for free). I discovered that there was still love in the world.
