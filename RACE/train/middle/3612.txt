Modern man has lived on the earth for only 35,000 years, but during that time, we have changed our planet in many ways. Many of the things that we have done are good, but more are not good for the earth.\nWater pollution\nA lot of people, birds and fish die each day because of water pollution. Factories have polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead.\nAir pollution\nIn big cities, factories, as well as cars, trucks and buses are the main cause of air pollution. Many people in cities now have serious health problems. For example, Mexico city used to be a beautiful sunny capital, but today it is always covered by thick brown clouds.\nSoil pollution\nIn order to have a good harvest, most of the farmers use chemicals too much in their fields. That's bad for the soil. But this kind of pollution is difficult to stop.\nHope for the future\nThese problems are very serious for our future, so all of us should do something to improve our environment. If we can stop pollution, our planet will become more and more beautiful and our health will be better. Let's be greener people!\n,.", "id": "middle3612.txt"}
