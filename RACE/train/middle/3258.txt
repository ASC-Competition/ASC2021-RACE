I was only 6 years old at that time. It was a very big room. I sat at the desk near the window, but I couldn't see anything because the windows were too high. There was a big map of the world on the wall. But I don't think I was worried or unhappy at that time. There was another little boy next to me. He sat there and kept quiet at first. Then he began to cry, because he didn't want to stay there.\nMore and more students came in , but the boy didn't stop crying \" Mom, I want to go home. \" He cried again and again. Later , the teacher came in . She went to the little boy, and said something to him. I couldn't hear what she said. Soon the boy stopped crying and began to smile.\nTo this day, I still don't know what the teacher said to the little boy.", "id": "middle3258.txt"}
