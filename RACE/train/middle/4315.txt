My alarm clock wakes me, which reminds me of school. I usually would sleep like a log, but today is a holiday and I have to be at the pool for swimming practice at a quarter to seven. About 30 swimmers show up for practice. An hour later, I ride my bike home. The suburbs  are quiet in the morning, with few cars on the street.\nI know I should be studying German but instead I wander to my room, lie down on the bed and sleep like a log. When I open my eyes again, the first thing I see is the alarm clock. It's 10:40 and I have a basketball class in less than 20 minutes. With the help of a shortcut  I arrive on time. About 15 kids and I spend the rest of the morning \"shooting hoops \".\nA bus takes us home,and I see a neighbour walking her dogs. It's past noon. Lunch is \"dousha baozi\" ,which my younger brother Richard doesn't eat. He devours  part of a cake from the fridge. I wonder if I should practise on the keyboard, study German, finish my homework, play chess,read or sleep like a log. I decide to play computer games for an hour and promise myself that I'll work on German later.\nAs the computer games hit higher and higher levels, Richard and I become more and more bored. He has been aching for  someone his own age to play with, and I write , he is _ . He is too sleepy.\nI think I'll turn off this computer and take him to the park. Then maybe I'll call on some of my old classmates.\nHolidays can be a time to learn, a time to play, a time to grow or a time to sleep like a log. Whatever you choose to do with your time, do something that you'll remember!", "id": "middle4315.txt"}
