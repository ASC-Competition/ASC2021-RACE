As he got closer to the farm, he saw many chickens and an eagle   playing together.\nHe then went up to the farm house and talked to the farmer, \"Sir, I was just passing by and I saw that you have many chickens and an eagle.\" The farmer smiled and said, \"That's not an eagle. It's a chicken.\" The young man kept saying that it was an eagle. He said to the farmer, \"Sir, that is an eagle! I can proveit to you.\" The farmer laughed, \"Sure, go ahead.\"\nThe young man then pulled that big bird out and climbed a high mountain. He held the bird in his hands and said, \"You are an eagle, fly!\" But the bird failed. The young man tried the second time. He said to the bird, \"I don't care you have been _ as a chicken for those years. But I know what you were created to be. You are an eagle, now fly!\" After the young man tried another three times, the bird began to flap   its wings. Finally, it flew high and began to fly around the farm.\nIt is true to us. Some people around us have continued to keep us down by lying to us. Over all of those years, we were told to be a failure, not to be good enough and to accept the \"reality\". They are wrong. We should try our best to reach our highest potential   to prove that we are eagles.", "id": "middle3203.txt"}
