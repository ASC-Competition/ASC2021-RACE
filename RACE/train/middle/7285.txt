He has been my idol   since 1991. I really wanted to understand him and his music. I used to use a dictionary to learn the meanings of words of songs written by him.\nThere was a lot of work to do to learn English, but I never felt tired. At first I learned about pronunciation, which was the hardest part for me. Because music was my\nonly source   of spoken English, sometimes I had to use a pronunciation dictionary. Then I made lists of words in order to remember them and their meanings. I would spend hours learning English grammar. What's more, I read a lot. I also tried to translate texts, dialogues and songs.\nBecause of my hard work, my English improved a lot. In the end, I entered a college and had a great chance to further improve my English. Now I am an English teacher. And I am still making progress in English.", "id": "middle7285.txt"}
