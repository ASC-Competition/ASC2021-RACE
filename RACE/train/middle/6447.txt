A young lady was working that day. She gave me five loaves and wished me good luck.\nI took the loaves and went out to sell them. It took me all day, but I sold them all. At the end of the day, I had some money. I was the happiest boy in the world as I walked home that evening.\nThe next day, I went to a bicycle shop. I paid a deposit on a new bicycle. And then I started my next job--as a newspaper deliver boy. Soon I could pay the rest of the money for the bicycle and the bike was mine. I was so proud!\nToday, I still work in the delivery business. I have a lot of trucks to send goods all over the country. I live in a beautiful house, but I don't ride a bicycle these days. I drive a large and nice car.\nI do not know who that young lady was. But because she gave me the start, I have become a successful man. I'd like to show my thanks to her.\nYours,\nGeorge Jenkins", "id": "middle6447.txt"}
