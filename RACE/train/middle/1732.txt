It teaches people how to face changes in their lives. It is just for teens. The book tells us that when facing change in our life, like a new school or new friends, don't be afraid. Use this change to make a better life.\nThe book gives an example of a change at school. A school is changing from having two terms to three terms because there are too many students. Several teens are talking about this. Most of them are unhappy and worried. But Chris is not. He laughs and tells a story about two mice, two\"little people\"and some cheese.\nThe four are in a maze looking for  The cheese. Here, cheese means some thing important in life. But they find the cheese is gone. The mice realize that they can't change what has happened and have to find more cheese. This means finding different dreams. The little people can't do this. They are afraid of change so they find no cheese.\nAfter Chris finishes the story, the friends understand one thing:to get more cheese, move in a new direction quickly. His friends understand how this can be used in the changes all teens face, such as doing well at school or feeling good about yourself.", "id": "middle1732.txt"}
