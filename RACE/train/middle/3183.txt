Our birthdays are on the same day, so every year we have a birthday party together. But this year we had a costume party instead.\nWhile we were writing the invitations, my mom came in and asked, \"Nancy, what about inviting John?\" John had been in our class for only a few months, but he was already getting better grades in math than anyone else in our class. \"Mom, he wears the same pants to school every day. How could he even afford a costume?\" Mom said nothing.\nThe next day, mom gave me an envelope  with a shopping card in it. \"I thought it would be nice for you to give this to John.\" Mom said. But how? We didn't want to make John embarrassed. We discussed it for a long time.

Before eating the birthday cake, Betty said in a loud voice, \"Now it's time for the great prize game.\" It was a math game.

He felt happy. So did we.", "id": "middle3183.txt"}
