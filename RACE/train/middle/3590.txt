Your problems at school may be a result of a number of things. You don't say much about how these classmates get along with each other. It's possible that all the students are feeling a little cautious  in the first term. It's also possible that the others are unkind. If this is not so, you have to find out why you are the class \"outsider\".In your letter you say you often offer to help others with their work. Is it possible that your classmates don't understand your offers? Could it seem that you were trying to \"buy\" friends with these offers, Is it possible that you took no notice of your classmates when you had your good friend near you? They may have felt hurt at that time. It may take a time for them to believe in you if so. Try to ask one classmate directly what the problem is. If you hear a negative  answer, at least you'll know what to do\nYours truly\nShelia", "id": "middle3590.txt"}
