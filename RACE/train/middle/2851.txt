If a person cannot hear, we say he or she is deaf.\nDogs who help deaf people must learn many different sounds. Then they must be able to show the deaf person what is making the sound. When they hear a visitor at the door, dogs learn to walk to the deaf person and then walk to the door. And if a telephone rings, they walk to the deaf man or woman and then walk to the telephone. These dogs can also help deaf mothers. If a baby is crying in another room, dogs walk to the mother and then to the baby. These dogs wear a yellow coat to show that they are special dogs that are helping a deaf person. There have been many times when these dogs have saved a life. You may see in a newspaper that a dog heard a fire alarm and lay down near the deaf person's feet. That is the sign for danger. The person knows that something is wrong and can go away from the fire.\nSpecial dogs can also help people who are disabled in various ways. For example, dogs can pull off their gloves or socks! Think how difficult your life would be if you were blind, deaf or disabled! But if you had a special dog like this to help you, your life would be much easier.", "id": "middle2851.txt"}
