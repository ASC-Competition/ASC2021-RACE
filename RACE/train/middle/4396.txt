The iPad can be bought in more than 200 U.S. Apple stores from Apple. Many fans even waited overnight outside some Apple stores, hoping to be the first to get one. Dozens of the people were waiting before the door opened at 9:00 a.m. Hiro Kishimoto, a Japanese computer researcher who had a meeting in San Francisco, came as early as 5:00 a.m. He wanted to read books and magazines with the iPad.  \" It's much more comfortable than a laptop . Because the laptop is too heavy to carry all the time, when you are in the living rooms, maybe the iPad is the best one to use.\" He said. The iPad models that hit the U.S. Market on Saturday with price starting from 499 dollars, only have Wi Fi   link to the Internet. Apple models that have both Wi Fi and 3G will be on sale in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Swizland and the UK in late April. With a 9.7 -inch touch screen like books and magazines, iPad can let users finish many tasks including making the web, watching videos, playing games and reding e-books. Apple is trying to remake the tablet computer. The iPad doesn't support Adobe's Flash software  that is used to watch many of the videos on the web. \" It is short of a keyboard, a mouse, USB ports and mwlti-tasking.\" some researchers said.", "id": "middle4396.txt"}
