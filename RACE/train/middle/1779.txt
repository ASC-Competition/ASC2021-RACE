Karachi has over 5 million people and Lahore has over 3 million people. Islamabad was built to be Pakistan's capital. The rich city people live in large, air conditioned houses.\nPakistan has 121,000 miles of roads. Bus services and minibuses are available to the public. The trains are still the most common transport of long-distance travel for Pakistanis. Pakistan also has an airline that operates domestic and international flights.\nIt is difficult to identify   Pakistani food because the country shares food traditions with its neighbour, India. The main difference between Pakistani and Indian food is that Pakistani food is less spicy  . Pakistani dishes are often made with yoghurt , which reduces the effect of the hot spices used in cooking.\nWheat is the main food for most of the people. It is eaten in the form of bread named chapattis or roti, together with vegetables in season. Sweet tea, milk, or lassi, a drink made from yoghurt, makes the meal perfect. Those who can afford to buy it eat meat, although in the countryside these are usually festival foods. Goat meat is a favourite. Pakistanis will not eat pork by the way.", "id": "middle1779.txt"}
