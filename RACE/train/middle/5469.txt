Suddenly a warning of a strong storm came to them, so all rushed to their boats. Yet, Love did not wish to run away quickly. There was so much to do. But as the clouds got darker, Love realized it was time to leave. But there was no boat to go into. Love looked around with hope.\nJust then Richness was passing by in a great large boat. Love shouted, \"Richness, can you take me with you? Richness answered, \"No, I can't. There is a lot of gold in my boat. There is no place here for you. \"\nLove decided to ask Vanity  for help who was also passing by in a beautiful boat. But Vanity said with a cold voice, \"No, I can't take you with me. My boat will get dirty with your wet feet. \"\nSadness passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was useless. \"No, I can't take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be alone. \"\nWhen Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. But Happiness was so happy that he didn't hear Love calling to him.\nLove was becoming restless and hopeless. Just then somebody called out, \"Come, Love! I will take you with me. \" Love did not know who was so kind, but jumped into the boat happily.\nAfter getting off the boat, Love met Knowledge. Love asked, \"Knowledge, do you know who was so kind to give me a lift when no one else wished to help?\" [:Zxxk.Com]\nKnowledge smiled, \"Oh, that was Time. \"\n\"Time?\" asked Love. \"But why did Time help me?\" Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, \"Because only Time is capable of understanding how great Love is. \"", "id": "middle5469.txt"}
