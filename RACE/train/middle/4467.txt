Many children like his class and he enjoys teaching them very much. All the pupils are quite interested in what Roger teaches them. They learn quickly and do everything carefully.\nOne day he said to the children, \"People in a lot of Asian countries wear white clothes at funerals, but the people in America wear white in the weddings because white means purity and happiness. What colour does an English woman wear when she gets married ?\"\nMary said, \"White, sir. Because she is happy.\" \"That is good, Mary.\" Roger said, \"You are quite right.
