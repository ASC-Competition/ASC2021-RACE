Here are some ideas:\nl Think more about what you eat.\nl Eat plenty of vegetables and healthy meats.\nl Don't eat desserts full of sugar; have fruit after dinner.\nl Try not to eat so much unhealthy food while you study.\nl It,s all right to have a little fast food sometimes--but not often.\nl Write down the foods you eat.\nl Walk, run, do sports--move and you will feel better!\nRemember that the \"freshman fifteen\" can happen to anyone.
