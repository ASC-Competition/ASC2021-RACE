I think that's my own business . Sometimes it looks like she doesn't trust me. It makes me very sad. How can I get her to stop?\nDear Katie,\nMany young people have the same problem as you. If you don't talk much with your parents, they might feel they need to ask you questions to know about your life. It seems to you that your mom is getting into your business, but I think she's just trying to keep a close relationship with you. In fact, some experts often tell parents to stay close to their kids by asking them about what's going on in their life.\nSome parents do this better than others, of course. But, unluckily, some parents ask questions because they don't trust their kids. So start by trying to trust your mom. She is probably just trying to stay close to you because she loves and cares about you. You can have a talk with her about it.\nOf course, that doesn't make the questions less boring. If you're tired of so many questions, tell your mom about your feelings the day before she asks. If you _ more information, conversations with your mom won't seem like she's just asking you too many questions!\nIf you do this, I'm sure you can get on well with your mom.\nDr. Smith", "id": "middle5158.txt"}
