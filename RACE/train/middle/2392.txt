Do they have time to do the things they like? Let's see what some students do during their free time. Ben is eleven. He has a sister, Kate. Both of them like going to the cinema. Every Sunday morning, they go to the town by train and then they go to the cinema because they live in the country  and there is no cinema there. They arrive in the town at noon. They usually have a big lunch in their favourite restaurant first, and then they buy some food in the supermarket  before they go to their favourite cinema called Star Cinema. They like it because the seats there are comfortable and the films shown in the cinema are always the newest. They always have a good time on Sundays, but when the weather is bad or they are busy with their homework, they can't go.", "id": "middle2392.txt"}
