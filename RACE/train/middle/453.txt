With most, that means slowing down --- even stopping and rereading a page or paragraph to really understand what the author is trying to say.\nLast summer, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said he was concerned about what he sees as a decline in slow reading. Instant messages and 140-character tweets appear to be reducing out ability to concentrate on a single idea or theme of a book, he told Foreign Policy Magazine.\nIt's easy to forget the benefits of deep reading in an age when anything worth doing is done fast.

Also, deep reading helps people develop thinking, writing and conversation skills.\n\"If you like beautiful things, authors put words together that are really beautiful and expressive,\" she says. \"If you want to write well--- and there are lots of reasons to express yourself clearly --- you should read.\"", "id": "middle453.txt"}
