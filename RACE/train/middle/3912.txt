Once while reading a magazine ad, Andrews found that the person who sold the most cookies could win a free trip for two around the world.

I'm earning a trip around the world for my mom and me by selling cookies. \" Then she asked,\" Would you like to buy one or two dozen boxes of cookies?\"\nAndrews kept asking for a whole year, no matter how heavily it was raining or snowing outside. Her hard work _ She sold 42,000 boxes of cookies that year and she won her trip around the world.\nAndrews is no smarter than thousands of other people.
