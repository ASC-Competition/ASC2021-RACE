We spent 10 days traveling around Rajasthan and I will never forget it. We saw lots of things like the Taj Mahal  and we went to a tiger reserve . Our guide was called Krishna and he was really nice especially when I didn't always understand things he would explain it to me and answer all my stupid questions. Also when I got ill with a fever, he was really kind and gave me medicine and got a priest  to give me a _ in a Hindu temple we visited, and then I got well again very quickly.\nThere were lots of amazing parts of the holiday. One was when we got to ride on elephants in Jaipur. My sister and I rode an elephant called Lucky. We were in a camel cart but Krishna talked to the camel's owner and we were allowed to ride on them, which was really cool. I also really liked the Taj Mahal because it was even prettier than I imagined. My sister lost her shoes. But the people in India are really kind, so we found them again. The weather was really hot which was nice because Krishna gave us lots of time to spend in the pool and relax in-between going to see all the amazing places.\nThis was the best holiday that I have ever been on. I wish I could come back another year.", "id": "middle7434.txt"}
