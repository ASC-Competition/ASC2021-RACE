On the first day, we visit   the Palace Museum. It is in the centre of Beijing. There are many rooms in it. You can see \"No photos!\" in some places. If so, you need to follow the instructions  . On the second day, we visit the Summer Palace. It's great fun to boat there. I can swim, so I'm not afraid of water. Tomorrow we will go to the Great Wall.\nI also make a new friend Tony who comes from Australia. When he leaves, he gives me his e-mail address and telephone number. After the six-day trip, we can go back to New York by plane. I hope to see you soon.\nBill", "id": "middle4229.txt"}
