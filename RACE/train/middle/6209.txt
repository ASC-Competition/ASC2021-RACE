The 16-year-old boy tried to imagine how serious the drought was for the students at that school. However, he realized it was more serious than he had imagined when he saw the sign \"DON'T wash clothes with water,or you will be punished . \"\nBecause of drought, the school has been short of water for a long time. Each student has only one bottle of water every day for washing and drinking. The drought has made the poor students much poorer.\nPeng is a student from Beijing Chaoyang Foreign Language School. He took part in the school's Rain & Bow Project from April 2 to 10.\nThe project idea came from Peng's principal . One day, she heard a sad story about Li Guoxian, a poor girl in the Mashan School,who stopped going to school because of drought. The principal started this project to help the school. In one day, 3,000 students made over 10,000 donations of water,books and clothes.\nPeng and other four students went to the Mashan School and gave the donations with five teachers. They visited poor families, made surveys and had classes at the school.\nDing Zhentao,16,was worried about the school's poor learning environment. \"The blackboards and playground are too _ to use,\"Ding said. \"Besides, there really aren't enough teachers. A teacher has to teach both history and English, and even the cook is a class teacher. \"\nAlthough life isn't easy, students at the school have a positive attitude towards life and they are quite willing to learn. That's what moved 16-year-old Chen Shi most.\n\"They sang their songs together as usual before class every afternoon. After class, the students asked us to tell them things about Beijing and our studies,\" Chen said. \"You can see the passion in them. I believe it will make a difference. Their futures will be bright. \"\n,.", "id": "middle6209.txt"}
