It's a hard question and few of us would even like to think about it. But 18-year-old Huang Ge has to answer this question and he says, \"I want to thank the people who have helped me.\"\nAt the age of one, Huang's mother left the family. Six years later, he was badly ill. He has been using a wheelchair since 9 years old. Doctors said he would only live to be 18.\nAfter Huang's story went on TV, hundreds of Chinese sent money to help him. The boy was so moved  that he decided to thank everyone of them. But it is not an easy job, because Huang was too sick even to drive a mosquito  away from his leg. Huang has to be tied to his wheelchair to stop him from falling out. And the family can only afford a three-wheeled motorcycle . Since 2003, the father and son have traveled 14,000 kilometers to 10 provinces, and thanked more than 30 helpers.\n\"I am moved by the story of this boy. We need the courage  to face death, and we should also feel the thankfulness for those who help us,\" reads an online article on CCTV,com.", "id": "middle1172.txt"}
