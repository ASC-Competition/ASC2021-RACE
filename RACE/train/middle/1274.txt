Her Barbi bike was just too old, and it needed repairing as well.\nAs Christmas came nearer, her dream for a bike seemed to disappear, so we thought, for she didn't mention it again. We were busy buying some beautiful storybooks, a doll house, a holiday dress and toys. Then much to our surprise, on December 24, she said she really wanted a bike more than anything else.\nNow we didn't know what to do. It was just toot late. We were busy with Christmas dinner and packing children's presents, parents' presents, a brother's present and friends' presents till midnight.So there was no time to take to buy the \"right bike\" for our little girl. Thinking that we were parents who would make their children unhappy, we felt guilty and sad.\nSuddenly my husband came up with an idea. \"What if I make a little bike out of clay  and write a note  that she could trade in  the model bike for a real one?\" So he spent the next five hours carefully working with the clay to make a small bike.\nOn Christmas morning, we were so excited for Almie Rose to open the little box with the beautiful red and white clay bike and the note. She opened and read the note loudly.\nShe looked at me and Ron and said, \"So does this mean I can trade in this bike for a real one?\" Smiling, I said, \"Yes.\"\nAlmie Rose had tears in her eyes when she replied, \"I would never trade in this beautiful bike that Daddy made me. I prefer to keep it rather than get a real bike.\" At that moment, we would have moved the God to buy her every bike on the Earth.", "id": "middle1274.txt"}
