This becomes a problem because most families love home cooking! The food tastes good and a family meal can bring everyone together. In some families, meals are often the only chance everyone gets to see each other at the same time during the day.\nAnother reason people enjoy home cooking is that it is a way of showing love. A parent who makes some cookies is not just satisfying a child's sweet tooth. He or she is sending a message  . The message says, \"I care about you enough to spend an hour making cookies that you will eat up in 15 minutes if I let you.\" There is also something about the smell of home cooking. The smell of cooking makes people happy. It makes most of us feel good and loved--even if we're the ones doing the cooking! Next time you smell a cake making, stop for a moment and pay attention to your mood (,).", "id": "middle2479.txt"}
