As soon as they began in April, my family would head straight to the beach for a weekend of camping.\nUnlike most of the world, Easter falls in autumn in Australia. This means that Easter is our last chance to enjoy the warm weather, swim in the ocean and sleep in the bush under the stars.\nWe'd pitch our tents  on clear patches of grass and look out onto an almost empty beach. Often we were the only ones camping and the whole beach would be ours alone.\nWe used to spend all day outside - swimming, hiking and fishing. On Easter morning, my parents would wake up early and plan an Easter egg hunt for my three brothers and me. They would hide the eggs in the strangest places - in abandoned  bird nests in the trees, under our tents and in every corner of the stones that surround  the beach.\nIn Australia, instead of chocolate bunnies, we had chocolate bilbies  . Bilbies are Australian animals with long ears. Chocolate bilbies were the best treat to find and there was always one for each of us.\nBut sometimes, other animals found them first, and all we'd find were brightly colored wrappers  with animal tooth marks.\nAfter the hunt we would come back to the campsite with our bellies   full of chocolate. For us, Easter wasn't about chocolate eggs or religious tradition. It was about being with our family in the great outdoors.", "id": "middle5909.txt"}
