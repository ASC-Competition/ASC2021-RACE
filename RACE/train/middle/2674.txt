It's true that time flies.\nIn the vacation, the weather was very hot, but I enjoyed myself.\nI did my homework in the morning. I got up at 6:30a.m. and took a walk in the garden for half an hour. After breakfast I began reading English and Chinese and did some math exercises. It usually took me three hours or more. I worked quite hard and I made great progress .\nI spent the afternoon outside. I went swimming and it was fun. I would not go home until it was about five or six o'clock. Sometimes my friends came to see me and we spent some time listening to music.\nIn this way I spent my vacation happily. I not only studied hard, but also became a good swimmer. Now I'm in good health and high spirits .", "id": "middle2674.txt"}
