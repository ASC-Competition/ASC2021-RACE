Standing by her chair, looking at the ink bottle, pens, and white paper, I decided that the act of writing must be the most wonderful thing in the world.\nYears later, during her final illness, mother kept different things for my sister and brother. \"But the desk,\" she said again \" is for Elizabeth.\"[:Zxxk.Com]\nI never saw her angry, never saw her cry.

I only knew that I had written it, and I could stop trying to make her into someone she was not.\nBut the present of her desk told me, as she'd never been able to, that she was pleased that writing was my chosen work.

It was my letter. \" In any way you choose, mother, you always chose the act that speaks louder than words\"", "id": "middle7535.txt"}
