He's not even hungry. Is he ill? No, but he does have a problem. He has nothing to do and there's just one reason: the Internet is down and Tony has nothing to do.\nWhen he woke up this morning, Tony was feeling great. He jumped out of bed full of plans for the weekend ahead. It would be a weekend like any other--a great weekend. But that was before he turned on his computer and wasn't able to go online. No Internet changed everything.\nJust as Tony is wondering how he can possibly have a normal weekend without the Internet, his mum walks into the kitchen. \"Is everything OK?\" she asks. \"No, mum, everything is definitely not OK,\" her sad son replies. \"I can't go online  and  I  have homework to finish.\" His mum laughs, \"The word program is still working, so what's the problem?\"\nWhat's the problem? Tony can't believe his own mother isn't able to see how serious the problem really is. To start with, he still needs to do research for his homework. He knows his mum will tell him to go to the library but he hates the library. It's so dark and uncomfortable. And forget homework--what about the rest of his weekend! Every weekend, he goes online to email friends. Then he reads the news to catch up on what's happening in the world. He plays a few online games and finishes the weekend off with an online chess game with his cousin Helen. The wonderful weekend-online! Now it's Saturday morning and he's not going to have access to the Internet for two whole days.", "id": "middle3309.txt"}
