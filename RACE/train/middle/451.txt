I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a little old lady smiling at me.\nShe said, \"Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?\"\nI laughed, enthusiastically responding, \"Of course!\" And she gave me a giant squeeze. \"Why are you in college at such an age?\" I asked.\n\"I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have children, and then retire and travel.\"\n\"No seriously.\"\n\"I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!\"\nWe became instant friends. Over the course of the year, Rose made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she took great delight in the attention given to her from the other students. _ . At the end of the term we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet   and I'll never forget what she taught us.\nAs she began to deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her note card on the floor. A little embarrassed she simply said, \"I'm sorry. This whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know.\" As we laughed, she cleared her throat and began: \"We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing; There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You have got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it! There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. Anyone can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change. Have no regrets. The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do.\"\nAt the year's end Rose finished the college degree. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over two thousand college students attended her funeral  to honor the wonderful woman.", "id": "middle451.txt"}
