Until a few hundred years ago, not many people were taught to read, so there was a lot more reading out loud by the few people who could.\nTo help those reading out loud in the old days, sign  known as \"points\" were added to pages of writing. Punctuation comes from the Latin word punctus, meaning \"point\". These points told readers when to pause  or take a breath, and what to emphasize .\nIn Europe from the early centuries AD, these points were widely used although not everybody used the same points for the same thing. When printing was invented, printers had to be made more clearly about what to put where, so that everyone was doing the same thing. Since that point, all sorts of punctuation rules have been discovered and invented.\nSpeech marks \"...\"\nSpeech marks or quotation marks are used to show that someone is speaking. The sort we have in English today began to be widely used during the 18th century. Before that readers simply understood from the way a sentence was written that someone was speaking although sometimes spoken words were underlined.\nComma , colon: period(full stop).\nAll three of these sorts of punctuation marks were given their Greek names by Aristophanes, a librarian who lived in Byzantium in the 2nd century BC. They were marks on the page, each with a message to the reader. Comma meant a short pause. Colon meant a medium  sized pause. Period meant a long pause.\nExclamation mark!\nIn the early days of punctuation, if you saw this sign, you were supposed to pause. Some people think the exclamation mark began as what the Greek word IO looked like if it was turned 90 degrees. This word means \"Oh, gosh!\" With the I on the top and the O under it, the sign as we know it today was developed.\nQuestion mark?\nIn the middle age, a squiggle  above a full stop was sometimes used to show the sentence was a question and that a person's voice should go up at the end. By the 17th century it had turned into what we call a question mark. The shape may have come from the letter Q short for that Latin quaestio, meaning \"question\".\nWriters make choices about punctuation because they think differently about sentences and words. It's part of the personality of their writing. Some writers hate punctuation, but others love punctuation. So whether you love or hate punctuation, the best advice may be to just enjoy it, play with it, think about it and use it. It belongs  to the language and it belongs to you.", "id": "middle7148.txt"}
