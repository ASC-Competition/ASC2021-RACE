You may spend time with a friend and get to see where he lives. So remember to be polite.\nWhen to arrive\nThe first thing to remember is that when a friend invites you, you need to arrive on time. If your friend tells you to come \"about 3:00\", that means you can arrive before 3:05. But usually it is a good idea to arrive at the right time.\nWhat to bring\nOften it is also nice to bring something to your friend's house. This could be a box of chocolates for you two to share, or maybe a movie that you can watch together. You can also bring some flowers. A little gift is a nice way to show your friend that you are excited to be at his house.\nHow to greet\nWhen you visit your friend's house, you may also meet his parents. You should tell them who you are and they may tell you their names. As a child, I went to visit my friend Paul. I called his parents by their first names John and Mary. But now I know it is more polite to call them Mr. or Mrs. Smith. This will show them more respect   and then they may tell you to call them by their first names. Another way to show respect is to call them Madam or Sir.\nIt is a cool thing to visit a friend's house. Be polite to your friend and your friend's parents, and you will be welcome again!", "id": "middle6174.txt"}
