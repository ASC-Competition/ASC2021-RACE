There were a test in the US. People of different ages, from 12 to 83, took the test. During the test, these people got all kinds of breakfasts and sometimes they got no breakfast at all. Scientists wanted to see how well they worked after they ate different kinds of breakfasts.\nThe result shows that if a person eats a right breakfast , he or she will work better than if he or she has no breakfast. If a student has fruit, eggs, bread and milk before going to school, he will learn more quickly and listen more carefully in class.\nThe result is different from what some people think. It shows having no breakfast will not help them lose weight.  This is because they become so hungry at noon that they eat too much for lunch. In fact, they will gain weight.  But they will lose more weight if they _ other meals.", "id": "middle229.txt"}
