Let me tell you what you have on Monday next week.\nWe have math at 8:00. How boring! Then we have English. That's interesting. I know you love English. Next is P.E.. The fourth lesson is art. That's my favorite subject! In the afternoon, we have history with Mr. Chen. He is fun but history isn't.  Then at 2:00 we have science with Miss Jones. You know how strict she is. I don't like her. Our last class of the day is math.\nYours,\nBen", "id": "middle4377.txt"}
