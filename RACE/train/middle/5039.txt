Also, don't wrap(......) a present in white, black or blue paper, because they are the colours for funerals . Don't give a knife, because something sharp can cut a friendship.\nIn Russia if you give flowers as presents, you have to give an odd number of them (one, three, five, etc.) because even numbers of flowers are for funerals.\nIn Germany if you are invited to dinner, flowers are good presents to take to your dinner hostess  , but don't take her red roses because it means you are in love with her. Don't take thirteen of anything because it's an unlucky number. Don't take an even number of anything, either. Don't wrap your presents in white, brown, or black paper.", "id": "middle5039.txt"}
