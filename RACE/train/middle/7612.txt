It shows one's name, date of birth, address, nationality, photo and ID number.\nChina's top legislature   added something new to the Resident Identity Card Law. It passed the suggestions of recording Chinese citizens' fingerprints when they apply for or change ID cards.\nFingerprints would make it easier to recognize the people who own the cards.

It will prevent their identity from being used by others when people want to do banking.\"\nAs ID cards will contain more personal information, many people worry that some institutions   may let their information out.
