She is in Grade Three in a primary school. She is a cute girl though  she has some interesting ideas sometimes.\nOne day she asks me, \"Mum, what is your favourite subject?\" I think for a while and answer, \"It is difficult to tell. I love singing, so music is my favorite. And I am good at English. My history teacher also says I am excellent. Well, I can say I don't like science. But science is important for us, you know. So you must do well in it. What is your favourite subject, Eyen? Tell me something about your subjects, dear.\"\n\"I like Chinese. It is easy. I like English because my English teacher likes me very much. I can't stand  Maths. It is serious  and sad.\"\n\"Do you mean your Maths teacher is serious and sad?\"\n\"No, it is Maths, not the Maths teacher.\"\n\"Why do you think so?\"\n\"Because Maths has so many problems ! Isn't it sad all day?\"", "id": "middle5709.txt"}
