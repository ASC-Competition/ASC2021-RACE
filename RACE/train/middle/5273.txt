So if you're having a bad day and need a boost,then help is just a click away.\nA website is trying to offer people positive messages from strangers to cheer them up. It announces to be\"the nicest place on the Internet\",where happy people can present their positive thoughts and feelings to those who are in low spirits.\nThe website, thenicestplaceontheinter.net, lets people post videos of themselves blowing kisses and leaving positive and encouraging messages to lift visitors' spirits.\nThe website was created by Jeff Lam and is considered to help many people out when they feel low. The well-known artist who lives in San Francisco said he came up with the idea when he and his friend Lauren were having one of those bad days.\n\"We tried to become cheerful,but none of the usual methods seemed to be working. Not music. Not food. What we hoped was something positive, honest and good.So with only a  camera and work-free weekend, we created'The Nicest Place On The Internet,\" he explained on his website.\nOne user of the site, Joseph Meehan, 27, from Birmingham, said,\"it's a fun and\nexciting website. I visit every once in a while when I'm missing my friends or family. I think it could really be a help to people that are feeling down or sad. It may even stop them from doing something stupid. You can also post your video to the website, and they add it to the series. It's very easy to share the love.\"\nMr. Lam is now working on a new project that allows people to leave positive voicemails for strangers. The idea is that strangers send an audio diary by leaving a voicemail and then anyone can listen to it.", "id": "middle5273.txt"}
