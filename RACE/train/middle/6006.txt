I have to look after them while I'm shopping. I go shopping with my husband only when I want to buy something for him. When I look at a cheap dress, he always says, \"It's nice on you.\" But when I have an expensive one in my hands, he always says, \"I don't think it fits you well.\" So I often go shopping with my friends. It's fun.\nMaria, 26 years old\nI like shopping very much, but I never go shopping on weekends. There are too many people in shops. I don't like shopping with other people. It usually takes me much time to buy things because I never buy the first thing I see. I always look around other shops to find the same thing cheaper. I'm good at finding cheap things. I don't like buying food in small shops or street markets. I think food in the supermarkets is fresh   and cheap.", "id": "middle6006.txt"}
