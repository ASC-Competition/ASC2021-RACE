He had no food or money. He only had a cooking pot. He\nmade a small cooking fire, placed his pot on it, and poured in some water. When a few villagers asked\nwhat he was doing, he said that he was making stone soup which was a recipe passed down from his\nfather. He then dropped   a round stone into the pot.\nThen the traveler told the villagers stories of his travels and the exciting things he'd seen.
