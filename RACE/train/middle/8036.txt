We ended up talking about computers and file-sharing . As we talked I found that he was more experienced and could teach me about file-sharing and networking. We went to his room and watched a movie about robots that he'd downloaded. The math homework was forgotten.\nThe next day he came again for homework help \"What do you do on weekends?\" he asked. The truth is, when I have work to do, I do it. I have no special time to\nwith friends. I was embarrassed about this. I expected him to think I was boring and said, \"Get a life!\" He said, \"OK. You're having trouble getting along with people I can show you. I'm old than you.\"\nLater, he checked my computer. He even connected me to an Internet chess server .He was becoming like a big brother.\nBut when I thought about it, I didn't really want Nitin's help\" His big-brother idea began to bore me.\n\"I'll get you some cool computer programs \".\n\"I'll teach you how to talk to girls.\"\nHe meant what he was saying, but I don't know why it didn't make me feel good. Since then he's hardly talked to me; we seem to have forgotten each other. I don't think he can \"teach\" me much, and I don't think much of him. But I could be wrong*", "id": "middle8036.txt"}
