It is very different from Christmas, Thanksgiving, or other well-known holidays. It is called Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day. This holiday is meant to be educational as well as fun. The idea is simple, and the name says it all. It is a day for working parents to show their kids what they do all day.\nAlthough this holiday doesn't seem very complex , it has meaningful purposes. There are many\ngood reasons why a child should know what his or her parents do at work. For one thing, it is hard for children to understand the life of an adult when all they know is school. Therefore, this holiday helps children learn what it means to have a job. It also helps them learn about the differences and similarities between their world and the grown-up world. When young people know more about their parents' lives, they can form stronger parent-child relationships. This alone is worth a day of celebration.", "id": "middle5282.txt"}
