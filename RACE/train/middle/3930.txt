Often a day that starts out bad just continues to get worse. Sometimes there's a \"domino effect \" with bad events. For example, you sleep through the alarm, so you're stressed. And you will sit in the bad traffic, which will also make you late for work, etc.\nHow can we turn a bad day to a good day? Here are some ideas that have worked for me:\nSmile a lot\nSmiling a lot will help you feel relaxed. Research has shown that smiling produces three useful chemicals which make us feel good.\nTalk to a good friend\nKeeping bad or unhappy things in your mind is not a good idea. Talking to someone who cares and listen really does help us feel better, too.\nConcentrate on your good things\nIt's hard to concentrate on how bad things are when you're concentrating on how good things are! Think of 10 or more things you're thankful for, and you'll achieve a whole new outlook  on your day.\nGet some exercise\nIf you can, go for a walk. Exercising will help you feel better. Excising can get your day back to be normal again.\nMake the day a challenge\nIf you make yourself think of the day as a challenge, you'll start to do all the things you can to make your day better.\n,.", "id": "middle3930.txt"}
