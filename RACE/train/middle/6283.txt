It finishes at 3: 00 p. m. So we can do lots of sports after school.\nIn my ideal school, there is a big dining hall. We have an hour for lunch. We can listen to music in the hall. We can have maths every day because I think maths is very interesting. The classes are very small. There are 15 students in each class. We can have a big library with a lot of _ books. We can also have a swimming pool.\nAfter school, we only have half an hour of homework every day. Every month, we can go on a school trip to a museum or a theater.", "id": "middle6283.txt"}
