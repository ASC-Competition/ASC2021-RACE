Matt said his phone was stolen from a bar in the East Village last February. He bought a new phone and carried on with his life. It wasn't until this January, however, that he was going through his photo stream and noticed tons of photos that weren't his, including several pictures of an unknown man posing next to an orange tree. More photos of food menus, fireworks and something strange kept appearing in his photo stream in the following days.\nMatt later learned that his phone, stolen almost a year ago, had ended up in China and that the new owner was still logged  into his iCloud account .\nAfter Matt wrote about the cross-seas connection on BuzzFeed, a web user translated it and posted it to Weibo. He started getting tons of attention from people in China about the story. They thought it was romantic like a fairy tale and perfect for the spirit of the Spring Festival.\nIn typical Chinese netizen -fashion, they were able to track down the information of \"Orange Brother\". He lived in Meizhou, Guangdong province. Web users loved this, and urged Matt to come to China and connect with his \"long-lost brother\".\nOrange brother made the first move. \"Matt, I welcome you to come to Meizhou and try some local food,\" he said on Weibo, China's micro blogging platform. That post was \"liked\" over 12,000 times. Matt quickly accepted. Matt began learning Chinese, while Brother Orange posted videos of himself learning English. But when they finally met, the smiles and hugs said it all.", "id": "middle5244.txt"}
