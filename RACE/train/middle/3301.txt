But which one is\nbetter?\nThe rapid reader may be a good reader when he reads a storybook for fun. But he may not be\nable to slow down enough to read directions  carefully. He may read so rapidly that he does\nnot take time to understand fully the ideas and information which are important to remember.\nThe slow reader may be a good reader when he reads directions for making something. But he\nmay spend too much time in reading a simple story which is meant to be enjoyed but is not\nimportant enough to be remembered.\nSo, you see, either a rapid reader or a slow reader is not really a good one. If you wish to\nbecome a better reader, here are four important things to remember about speed of reading.\n1. Knowing why you are reading will often help you to know whether to read rapidly or\nslowly.\n2. Some things should be read slowly throughout. Examples are directions for making or doing\nsomething, science and history books, and Maths problems. You must read such things slowly or\nremember each important step and understand each important idea.\n3. Some things should be read rapidly throughout. Examples are simple stories for enjoyment,\nletters from friends and bits of news from hometown papers.\n4. In some of your reading, you must change your speed from fast to slow and slow to fast, as\nyou go along. You will need to read certain  pages rapidly and then slow down and do more\ncareful reading when you come to important ideas.", "id": "middle3301.txt"}
