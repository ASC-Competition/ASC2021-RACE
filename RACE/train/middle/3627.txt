Four people share their favorites:\nSarah /England\nMy favorite proverb would have to be \"Don't judge   a book by its' cover.\" I think it can be used in many daily situations. Obviously, when you meet new people, you always need to give someone a chance. So, I think that a chance is always good for someone, probably better than judging on first impressions  .\nGareth / England\nMy favorite proverb is \"Hear and I forget; see and I understand; I do and I know.\" I like it because it means until you actually do something, it's hard to really, truly know it. I believe that a lot of the times when you're learning by hearing, it's very difficult to get that knowledge. When you see something, it gets a little bit better, but when you do something, that's when you really truly know something.\nLindsay / United States\nI really like the proverb, \"The grass is always greener on the other side.\" I think that's really true, and I find that it's always like that. I always want what I can't have, and then when I get that, then I find out that it's not as great as I had hoped it would be. So, because of this, I try to always keep that in mind and be happy for what I have.\nWarren / Canada\nI think \"What goes around, comes around \" is what comes to mind for me. I think it is really true. Basically, if you do something good, good things will happen to you. And if you do bad things, bad things are going to happen to you, maybe not right away but after a long time.", "id": "middle3627.txt"}
