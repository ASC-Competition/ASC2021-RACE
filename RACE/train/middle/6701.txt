There was a boy at the other side of the street. The boy sat before a store and took some bread out of a bag and then began eating it.\nThere was a very thin dog in the street too. The boy said to it very kindly. \"Come here, good dog. Do you want a piece of bread?\"\nThe dog was very hungry and went to the boy, but he didn't give it any of his bread. Instead, he kicked   the dog. It ran away and the boy laughed.\nThen Mr Stilwell came out of his house and said to the boy, \"Do you want a dollar?\"\nThe boy was happy and said, \"Yes, I do.\"\n\"Come here,\" Mr Stilwell said. The boy went to Mr. Stilwell, but Mr Stilwell didn't give him a dollar. Instead, he hit him with a stick.\nThe boy cried and said, \"Why did you hit me? I didn't ask you for any money.\"\n\"No,\" Mr. Stilwell said, \"and the dog didn't ask you for any bread, but you kicked it.\"", "id": "middle6701.txt"}
