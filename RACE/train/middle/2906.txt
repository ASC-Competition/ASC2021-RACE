She wasn't watching where she was going , so she fell into a sewer   and got trapped. Luckily she didn't hurt badly. She quickly climbed out and walked away. But her accident was caught on a mall camera. Then someone posted it on YouTube. The video was viewed almost 2 million times and received national attention. Jenny was angry with this, but she learned a deep lesson: Texting while walking is dangerous. This time I just fell into a sewer. Next time I didn't know what would happen. Maybe I would be knocked down by a car or something else. It was horrible.\nJenny may be famous for her mistake. After that, she was laughed at by her friends and workmates. She _ what she had done. But it was too late. However, she wasn't the only one who got into trouble while texting on the phone. In 2008, more than 1000 Englishmen visited hospital for similar reasons. They were walking and texting or talking on the phone. Suddenly a wall appeared! Or a hole or something like that got in the way. There were cuts, bumps, broken bones and even worse result happened on them.\nSo we must be careful when we are walking. Don't send messages or talk with somebody on the phone while walking. Or you may hurt yourself and become another Jenny in the future.", "id": "middle2906.txt"}
