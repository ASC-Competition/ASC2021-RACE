Both men were very old and badly ill, and they spent 24 hours a day in bed in the room.\nLuckily, one of the old men had his bed by the window, and every day he spent hours telling his friend far from the window what he could see through the window. He told him about the traffic going by, the children playing in the park opposite, and the birds flying in trees. The old man far from the window got a lot of pleasure from hearing about the world outside, but after a time he began to get rather unhappy. How nice it would be, he thought, if he had the bed by the window and could see everything for him, instead of just hearing about it.\nOne night, the man by the window called to his friend, \"Quick! Pull the alarm by your bed; I don't think I can get through the night!\" But his friends, expecting an empty bed by the window, did nothing---he just closed his eyes and went back to sleep.\nThe next morning, the nurse found the man dead in his bed by the window.\nThe old man was very excited as they moved him into the empty bed by the window. He sat up in bed, pulled back the curtain, looked out --- and saw only a wall.", "id": "middle740.txt"}
