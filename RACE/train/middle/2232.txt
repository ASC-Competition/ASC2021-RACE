You need to take enough food and water for a full day of activity on each walk. This is the most important thing to remember.\nWear good lace-up shoes, because you need to do some climbing sometimes.\nEach walk has a grade. If you haven't been bushwalking before, we suggest that you start with an easy walk- Grade 1 or 2. If you have been bushwalking before, then a Grade 3 walk may be suitable.\nAll beginners need to call or e-mail the leader of an activity 48 hours before the start of the activity. They need to make sure that you are fit and able to finish the activity as planned.\nMembership fees  for a year:\n$35 for an adult over 18 years old.\nIf a family joins the club, fees will be lower. $55 for the parents and $10 for each child between the ages of 5 and 18.", "id": "middle2232.txt"}
