He turned on the light and looked at the clock. It was half past twelve. \"Who can be it at this time of night?\" he wondered. He decided to go and find out. So he got out of bed, put on his jacket and went to the door. When he opened the door, there was nobody there. \"That's very strange,\" he thought. Then he went back to his bedroom, took off his jacket, got back into bed, turned off the light and tried to go to sleep.\nA few minutes later he heard the doorbell ring again. Mr. White jumped out of the bed very quickly and rushed to the door. He opened it, but again he found no one there. He closed the door and tried not to feel too nervous. Then he saw a piece of paper on the floor inside the door. He picked it up. There were some words on it: \"Now it's after midnight, so it's April 1st. Happy April Fool's Day!\"\n\"Oh, it was the funny boy next door!\"  Mr. White smiled.\n,.", "id": "middle6141.txt"}
