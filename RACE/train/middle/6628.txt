Its old meaning is used to express a temperature that is a little bit cold. As the world changes, the word has many different meanings.\n\"Cool\" can be used to _ feelings of interest in almost anything. When you see a famous car in the street, maybe you will say \"It's cool.\" You may think, \"He's so cool,\" when you see your favorite footballer.\nWe all maximize   the meaning of \"cool\". You can use it instead of many words such as \"new\" or \"surprising\". Here's an interesting story we can use to show the way the word is used. A teacher asked her students to write about the waterfall. On one student's paper was just the one sentence, \"It's so cool\". Maybe he thought it was the best way to show what he saw and felt.\nBut the story also shows a scarcity   of words, it seems that some people have no words to show the same meaning without \"cool\" . Can you think of many other words that make your life as colorful as the word \"cool\"?  Yes, I can. And I think they are also very cool.", "id": "middle6628.txt"}
