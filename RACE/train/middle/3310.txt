A little boy loved to climb to the tree top, ate the apples and played around it. With time on, the little boy grew up. He no longer played around it every day. One day, the boy came back, sad. \"Come and play with me,\" the tree said. \"I am no longer a kid.\" The boy replied, \" I need money to buy toys.\" \"I don't have money..., but you can pick all my apples and sell them.\" The boy was so excited. He picked all apples and left happily. The boy never came back after that.\nOne day, the boy returned. \"Come and play with me,\" the tree said happily. \"I have no time to play. We need a house for my family.\" \"You can cut off my branches.\" So the boy cut all the branches off the tree and left happily. But he never came back since then.\nAgain, the boy returned and said. \" I want to make a _ across the sea. Can you give me a boat?\" \"Use my trunk  to build your boat.\" So the boy cut the trunk to make a boat. He went sailing and never showed up for a long time. Finally, the boy returned after he left for so many years. \"Sorry, my boy. But I don't have anything for you anymore. the only thing left is my dying roots.\" the tree said with tears.\n\"I don't need much now, just a place to rest. I am tired after all these years.\" The boy replied.\n\"Good! Old tree roots is the best place to rest. Come and rest with me.\" The boy sat down and the tree was glad and smiled with tears.\nYou may think that the boy is cold to the tree but that's how we are treating our parents. The tree is our parents. When we were young, we loved to play with them. When we grow up, we leave them, and only come to them when we need something or when we are in trouble. Whatever we ask for, parents will give everything they have and always be there waiting for us home.", "id": "middle3310.txt"}
