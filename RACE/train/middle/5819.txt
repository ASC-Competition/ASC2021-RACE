In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a heavy body and small wings.It was never able to fly.\nThe man was in his kindness, but he didn't understand the nature rules.Before the butterfly came out of the cocoon, fluid  from its body must be forced into its wings, and then would be ready for flying.It must have a hard struggle  to get through the small opening to get its freedom from the cocoon.\nSometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life.If God allowed us to go through our life without any difficulties, it would make us fail.We would not be as strong as we could have been, we could never fly.", "id": "middle5819.txt"}
