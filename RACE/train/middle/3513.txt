He decided to stop for a few drinks, so he tied  his horse outside the bar, walked into the bar and ordered two bottles of beer. This cowboy was new in town. He looked around and noticed some people making faces to him. He guessed that they might play some tricks   on him, but he said nothing and continued to drink. After drinking, he walked out of the bar and found his horse lost.\nHowever, he kept calm, came back into the bar, and said slowly, \" I don't know what you fools did to my horse out there... but I'm leaving in five minutes, and by then if my horse isn't back where it's supposed to be, well ...
