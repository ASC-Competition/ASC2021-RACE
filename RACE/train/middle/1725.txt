It ended up on December 30. But it told the drivers the meaning of the new traffic laws and the dangers of drinking.\nIn Beijing, some restaurants put up notices and told drivers about their responsibility. \"Usually if a group of guests come by car, the driver won't drink. If he does, we will remind him,\" said a waitress from Dongfang Restaurant in Beijing. Fewer drivers are drinking alcohol nowadays, since many know about the campaign.\nWang Lankun, a traffic policeman in Beijing said, \"Some drivers think a glass of beer is not a problem. But a blood test will show that their blood-alcohol level is more than 20mg for each 100ml of blood, that is enough to affect their driving.\"\nDuring the campaign, drivers who have a blood-alcohol level of over 20mg for each 100ml of blood will get a fine of 500 yuan. Also, they will not be allowed to drive for three months.\nIn fact, there are strict laws to punish drunk driving in many other countries. For example, in the USA, if someone has a blood-alcohol level of over 80mg for each 100ml of blood, he will be sent to prison for one year. But in Britain, he will be fined 5,000 pounds and banned  from driving for 12 months, also he will be sent to prison for 6 months. In Germany, if a driver has a blood-alcohol level of over 60mg for each 100ml of blood, he won't be allowed to drive until he passes a new driving test.", "id": "middle1725.txt"}
