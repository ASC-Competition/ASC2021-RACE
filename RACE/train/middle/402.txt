He is well known for a painting calledChildren's Games. People like this painting because it is full of fun. It shows how children in Pieter's time enjoyed themselves in different ways. In all, there are about eighty games being played in the painting.\nChildren's Gamesshows a busy street scene in a town long ago. The street is a wide and open space. There are no cars, so there is plenty of room to play. There are about two hundred children in the painting. Some play in groups and others play alone. They seem to be enjoying their freedom in the fresh air and their games. Some of the games are still played today.\nThe games in the painting do not require children to spend money on extra materials . Instead, they use simple everyday objects like hats and sticks. A game might need a rope, some chalk, a hoop, a spinning top, or even a barrel. Some games are played without any toys at all. For example, one scene in the painting shows children turning somersaults  inside the fence.\nEven though Pieter Bruegel lived a long time ago, children today can learn an important lesson from what he painted. The painting shows us how little we need in order to enjoy ourselves. All children really need is one another. It's not the toys or games that are found in the stores that create fun. Using our imagination can do this for us.", "id": "middle402.txt"}
