Yesterday our English teacher gave us copies of the play.\n\"Choose a character in the play whom you'd like to be, \"she told us. \"This afternoon learn a few lines of this part for homework. Then tomorrow you can say those lines in front of the class. Ill decide who play each part.\"\nI wanted to have one of the bigger parts in the play, so I choose the part of the king. He has a lot of lines to say. I learned them by heart.\nThis morning in our English lesson we had to say our lines. I acted the part of the king. When I said my lines, I put a lot of expression into my acting. I thought I acted really well.\nEveryone in the class read a part and then the teacher who would play each part.\nMany of the students in my class couldn't act at all. They couldn't even read without making lots of mistakes. I was sure that I would get a big part in the play.\nHowever, the teacher gave me the part of a soldier. He has only one line. It is, \"Yes, sir!\"\nI was very disappointed. At the end of the lesson I went up to her and asked her why I had such a small part.\n\"You put too much _ in your acting,\" she said. \"Good acting is not big acting. It is acting the audience can believe in.\"\nI think I know what she means.", "id": "middle3303.txt"}
