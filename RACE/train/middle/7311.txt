The tree was not strong enough to climb, so the priest decided that if he tied a rope to his car and drove away so that the tree bent  down, he could then reach up and get the kitty. He did so, checking his progress in the car again and again, then work out if he went just a little bit further, the tree would be bent enough for him to reach the kitty. But as he moved a little further forward, the rope broke.\nThe tree went \"boing!\" and the kitty at once sailed through the air -- out of sight. The priest felt terrible. He walked all over the neighborhood asking people if they'd seen his kitty. Nobody had seen a lost kitty.\nSo, he prayed, \" _ \" and went on about his business.\nSeveral days later he was at the grocery store, meeting one of his church members. He happened to look into her shopping cart and was amazed to see cat food.

You won't believe this, but I saw it with my own eyes. A cat suddenly came flying out of the blue sky, with its paws spread out, and landed right in front of her. \"", "id": "middle7311.txt"}
