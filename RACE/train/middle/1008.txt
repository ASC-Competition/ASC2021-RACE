It means a little cold at first. As time changes, the word gets many different meanings. We can use \"cool\" when we talk about something wonderful or somebody looking smart. For example. When you see a beautiful and expensive car in the street, you can say, \"It is cool.\" You may think the popular singer Jay Chow is cool. You can also use the word to mean something new and surprising. Here is an example. One day a teacher took the students to a farm and then asked them to write something about the visit. One of her students just wrote, \"The farm is so cool.\" Because he thought \"cool\" was the best word to show what he saw and felt. It also shows some people don't have enough words. Without \"cool\", they seem to have no other words to use. Can you think of any other words like \"cool: with so many meanings? If you can they are also very \"cool\".", "id": "middle1008.txt"}
