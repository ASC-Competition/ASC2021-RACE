It is called Auld Lang Syne (<<>> ). It is the traditional music played during the New Year's celebration. Auld Lang Syne is an old Scottish poem. It tells about the need to remember old friends.\nThe words \"auld lang syne\" mean \"old long since\". No one knows who wrote the poem first. However, a version by Scottish poet Robert Bums was published in 1796. The words and music we know today first appeared in a songbook three years later.\nThe song is played in the United States mainly on New Year's Eve. The version   you are hearing today is by the Washington Saxophone Quartet. As we end our program with Auld Lang Syne. I would like to wish all of our radio friends a very Happy New Year! This is Buddy Thomas.\n,.", "id": "middle5189.txt"}
