However, no matter what happens, I can always face it bravely.\nIn July, last year, I couldn't believe the news that I was allowed to enter the only key high school in my hometown. Then I rushed to my home and told my parents. But my father didn't seem as excited as I was. They didn't say a word. My father just kept smoking and my mother put her head down and couldn't help crying.\nWhat I saw didn't make me surprise. I knew very well what my family was like. My mum had been in bed for two years because of her disease. I knew my family lived a hard life and couldn't afford my tuition fee  . I felt so upset at that moment, but I could say nothing to my parents.\nI decided to help my father with his work to support my family instead of continuing my schooling.\nTo my surprise, things completely changed just three days before the beginning of the new term. My head teacher who had taught me three years came to my family with some money, which had been raised by my schoolmates. He encouraged me, \"Always have dreams.\"\nAt the same time,my father also earned some extra money so that he could afford part of my tuition fee.\nI knew I was such a lucky dog and decided to study harder in return. With tears in my eyes, I stepped into the key high school that I had dreamed of.\nI have been studying hard since I entered the high school. Whenever I meet difficulties, I always think of my teacher and schoolmates, and I can always get enough courage to go on, because I have a college dream and must work hard for it no matter how hard the life is. I believe what the saying \"where there is will, there is a way.\" tells us.\n,.", "id": "middle3905.txt"}
