What do  you think ? Here  are some students' ideas.\nJill : I think it's a good idea ! I usually get up at 6:10 and it's difficult for me . At night I have to do lots of homework and I like to watch TV . I go to bed at about 10:00 p. m. I  usually can't catch the bus at 7:30 in the morning . I am often late for school\nSally : I don't think it's a good idea . I always get up at 5:30 in the morning . it's the best time of the day . First I do some morning exercises . Then I read and have breakfast . So I will be happy if class begins at 8:00\nBill: I  get up at 6:30 . I always go to school without breakfast . A morning class is not good for me . I hope I can go to school after 8:30.\n,", "id": "middle2440.txt"}
