By the year 2050 there may be 12.5 billion . There are a lot of people to feed. We need more and more food.\nOne way to produce more food is growing stronger plants. For thousands of years, farmers have made plants better. Every season, they pick the best plants for the next season. It works very slowly. Since 1983, scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic  material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified  foods, or GM foods\nBy changing the genetic material of a plant, it is possible to make new plants.
