There are times when most of us would have sweet and ice-cream rather than eat meat and rice. Sweets and ice-cream are not bad for the stomach if we eat at the end of a meal. If we drink beer at meals, it may take away your appetite . It is important for us to eat our meal at the same time each day. When we feel hungry, it is a sign  that our body needs food. When we feel angry or excited, we may not want to eat.\nA long time ago, in England, some judges  often decided whether a man was telling the truth by giving him some dry bread. If the man could not swallow the bread, it was a sign that he was not telling the truth. Although this seems very strange and rather foolish , it is really a good way of finding out the truth. A man who is worried has difficulty in swallowing anything dry. Because of his worriment, he loses his appetite and doesn't want to eat.", "id": "middle7675.txt"}
