We drink warm tea or milk in the morning. Many people have some bread, eggs or hamburgers.\nAround noon it is the lunchtime. Many people take their food to schools or their work-places.

Healthy fish slowly replaces* beef and pork. It's healthy to drink one glass of water or juice after lunch.\nAt six or seven in the evening, it's time for dinner. At this time, families usually get together*to have dinner at home. We often have warm food. Sometimes we go to restaurants to eat.", "id": "middle4391.txt"}
