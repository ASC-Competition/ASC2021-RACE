But she always said, \"Do it yourself, dear.\" I was not happy about this at all. I thought she was the laziest mother in the world!\nFor example, one day, some of my friends would come to my home. My bedroom was really untidy. Books were all over the floor, and I didn't make the bed. So I asked my mum to help me clean it, but she still said, \"Do it yourself, my daughter.\"\nBecause of my \"lazy mum\", I have to wash my clothes and clean my room. I have to help my parents do housework. I even have to go to hospital by myself. It is very hard to do everything well on my own, but I have learnt a lot.\nAs time goes by, I come to understand my mum. She makes me clever and hard-working. How great she is!
