They talk about the role robots will play in industry.\nWhat is a robot?Basically ,it is a machine which is designed to do the work of a human being. It is usually controlled by a computer. Once it has been given a set of things to do,it will do the job on its own.\nNowadays,Britain has 120 robots at work in industry. This compares  badly with other industrial countries. In Japan,there are 4,000 robots in use. In the USA there are 2,000 and in Germany there are 500. According to the report,the government must help people understand how robot technology can be used. Also,people must be educated to know how important this new technology is. The designing of new robots will be very important in the future. The report says that special robot centres should be set up where people who design robots and people who will use them work together. The assembly  work of the future will be complex . So firms  must develop robots to do it.", "id": "middle6806.txt"}
