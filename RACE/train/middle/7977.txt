He could tell she needed help. So he stopped his car in front of her car and got out.\nHe smiled at her, but she was worried. Was he going to hurt her? He looked poor and hungry.\nHe said: \"I'm here to help you ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car? By the way ,my name is Joe.\"\nShe had a flat tire . Joe crawled under the car and soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. She said that she couldn't thank him enough for his help. Joe just smiled as he closed her trunk .\nShe asked him how much she owed him. But Joe wasn't thinking about the money. This was helping someone in need. He told her that if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she should lend a hand.\nHe waited until she had driven off and felt good as he headed for home.\nA few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe. She went in to get a bite to eat. The waitress brought a clean towel for her to wipe her wet hair. The waitress was nearly eight months pregnant .It was tiring for her to move about. But she did it all with a sweet smile on her face. The lady was moved by the wonderful service the waitress was giving. After the lady had finished her meal, and the waitress had gone to get her change from a Y=100 bill, the lady slipped out the door. At her table, the waitress found something written on a napkin.\nThere were tears in her eyes when she read what the lady had written. It said: \"You don't owe me a thing. I know life is hard for you right now. Someone once helped me out, the way I'm helping you. If you really want to pay me back, don't let the chain of love end with you.\"", "id": "middle7977.txt"}
