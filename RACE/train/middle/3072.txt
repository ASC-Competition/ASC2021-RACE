In Greenland , there is a hotel made of ice, open between December and April every year. In Turkey , there is a cave  hotel with a television, furniture, and a bathroom in each room. And in Bolivia , there is a hotel named the Salt Palace Hotel.\nThousands of years ago, the area around the Salt Palace Hotel was a large lake. But today, the area has only two small lakes and two salt deserts .\nThe larger of the two deserts is called Uyuni salt desert. During the day, the desert is bright white because of the salt. There are no roads across the Uyuni desert, so local people must show guests the way to the hotel.\nIn the early 1990s, a man named Juan Quesada built the hotel. He cut big blocks of salt from the desert and used the blocks to build it. Everything in the hotel is made of salt: the walls, the roof , the tables, the chairs, the beds, and the hotel's bar.\nThe sun makes the walls and roof warm during the day. At night the desert is very cold, but the rooms are warm. The hotel has twelve rooms. A single room  costs$40 a night, and a double room  costs$60.\nA sign on the hotel's wall tells guests, \" Please don't lick the walls.\" [:Zxxk.Com]", "id": "middle3072.txt"}
