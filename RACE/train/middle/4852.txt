There were 153 people on the plane, including some French officials. Though people have been searching since the plane went down, the result looked unpleasant, for most of the passengers might be in bad luck. But a 13-year-old girl called Bahia Bakari was discovered in the water, where she had been staying afloat  by holding a piece of wreckage(   ) from the plane tightly for over 13 hours. When they found her, the girl was too weak to catch the lifebuoy( ) thrown to her, instead, a Comoran police officer jumped into the water to pull the child onto the boat. Bahia Bakari was injured, especially her collarbone(   ).Her father was pleased to see his daughter although his wife had gone away in this _ . He said that his daughter could hardly swim. It was really a miracle for her to escape in this way. In her daddy's warm arms, the girl could soon remember what she had experienced. \"I was thrown out of the plane and then I saw the plane fall into the water. Next I found myself in the water. I couldn't swim very well and I caught something but I didn't know what is was,\" said the girl. \"She is really a lucky young girl,\" said Alain Joyandet, France's minister for International Cooperation.", "id": "middle4852.txt"}
