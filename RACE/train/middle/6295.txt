The sign is not written in Korean or English; it is written in Chinese.\nThese signs, and signs in other countries warning Chinese tourists about their behavior, have shamed many Chinese who worry about the image of the country.\nOver 70 million Chinese tourists made overseas trips last year and spent $102 billion, more than the $84 billion spent by American and German tourists. For many Chinese tourists, it was their first trip abroad and they didn't know about foreign ways. And some of these tourists took their bad habits from China with them.\nWang Yang, a Chinese deputy prime minister , said, \"They(the tourists) speak loudly in public, carve words or numbers on tourist attractions, cross the road when the traffic lights are still red and spit anywhere. It damages  the image of the Chinese people and has a very bad influence.\"\nBefore you travel to a foreign country, it's important to learn some things about the country and its culture. You are guests in the country and it's important to respect  your hosts. As more and more Chinese visit foreign countries, their behavior will certainly change and those shameful signs will, hopefully, disappear.", "id": "middle6295.txt"}
