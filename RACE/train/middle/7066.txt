CO2goes into the air when we burn fossil fuels to run our industries, cars and so on. Luckily, half of the CO2that we produced is taken in by plants, trees, land and the oceans. The rest gases are still large to cause worry. At the same time, we are cutting down forests that take in carbon from the air.\nTo solve the problem is not an easy job. Developed nations such as the USA, Germany and Australia will have to promise to cut down greenhouse gases by as much as 25-40%. Countries such as India and China that have a large population and growing industry, have to leave a smaller greenhouse gas footprint. Everybody must be active and stick to it.", "id": "middle7066.txt"}
