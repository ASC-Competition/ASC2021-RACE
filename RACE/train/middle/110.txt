However, when she first walked past the students in the school, her excitement turned to fear, and then to loneliness over the next few days. \"Why didn't anyone say 'hi' to me or invite me to his or her lunch table? Is it because of my clothes or my hair?\" she wondered. Almost every day during the first week, Anna stayed alone, thinking that there must have been something wrong with her or that nobody saw her at all!\nWhat caused Anna's problem? The reason was that nobody knew her. Most people don't like talking with strangers  . So it's your job to volunteer to make contact with people who you want to know. The easiest way to catch their attention is to notice them first. Make eye contact with them and smile at them. When you smile at them, you are doing your best to show your kindness to them, and they are sure to understand that you are saying, \"Hey, how's everything going?\" In this way, you are taking the first step towards the road to friendship.\nWhen Anna realized this, she started talking to her classmates. Guess what happened? It really worked. She had made two friends by the end of the month.\nIn fact, saying \"hi\" or making friends with strangers is not hard. And the joy it brings you is really great. So try to open your heart to strangers!", "id": "middle110.txt"}
