This is a game called \"Happy Farms\". Now more and more people are joining in the game, and getting addicted. Some of them are even found playing the game at work. Because of this, some players have been fired by their bosses. Lovers have broken up, but none of them can stop Happy Farms from becoming more popular.\nHere we interviewed some young netizens and let's see what their opinions were.\nNongmin: Playing happy Farms at work, that's terrible! A clerk was fired because she was online playing it at work.\nKing: I find that all the dreams of having houses and fields, which are very hard to get in real life, are very easy to be realized in the games. I think I know the reason why the game is so popular.\nKaixin: We have to know how to control ourselves. We should keep our minds on study. Games are just games. I prefer to play sports with my classmates when I am free.\nKitty: I like Happy Farms. My high-pressure work makes me feel like I can't breathe. I wish I could have a real house and farm, but it seems so far away. I have to turn to virtual  nature for my own house and farm.\nPeople often get tired from work or study, so they go to their own farms, take care of their crops and pull out weeds. It is really delightful to forget about the pressure. But some players work from morning to night to \"grow and steal crops\". They lose themselves in the game and show no interest in anything else. It is really terrible.", "id": "middle7925.txt"}
