They had a lovely dog called Blackie, but they could not take it abroad with them, so they had to look for a good place to leave it while they were away, and at last they found a place which looked after dogs very well while their owners were away. They left Blackie there just before they started for their holiday.\nAt the end of their holiday, they came back to Sydney very late at night, and as they thought that the place where Blackie was staying might be closed at that late hour, they decided to wait until the next morning.\nSo the next morning Mr. Brown got into his car and drove off happily to meet Blackie. When he got home with the dog, he said to his wife, \"Do you know, dear, I don't think Blackie enjoyed his stay at that place very much. He barked(,) all the way home in the car as if he wanted to tell me something.\"\nMrs. Brown looked at the dog carefully and then answered, \"You are quite right, dear. He was certainly trying to tell you something. But he wasn't trying to tell you that he hadn't enjoyed his stay at that place. He was only trying to tell you that you were bringing the wrong dog home.\"", "id": "middle7371.txt"}
