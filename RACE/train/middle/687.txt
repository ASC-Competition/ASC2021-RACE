He is nine years old. He likes playing basketball very much. When he is free, he always plays basketball with his friends in the open air. Sometimes he walks in the forest and picks some flowers by himself.\nLast Friday, Jamie finished his homework after the second class in the morning. He hurried to play basketball. The playground was wet. After some time his basketball was dirty and his hands were dirty, too. It was 9: 45 and the third class began. Jamie had no time to wash his hands and ran into his classroom. Mr Black, his English teacher, told Jamie to write some new words on the blackboard. Jamie stood in front of the blackboard and started to write. Mr Black saw his right hand was dirty.\n\"Oh, dear!\" said the teacher. \"Your right hand is dirty. I'm sure it's the dirtiest in our class.\"\n\"You are wrong, Mr Black,\" said Jamie. Then he showed his left hand and it was dirtier.", "id": "middle687.txt"}
