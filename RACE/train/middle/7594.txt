Well, Greg Mortenson wanted to climb a mountain, but he ended up helping thousands of people to have a better life.\nGreg's story began with failure. In 1993, he set out to climb K2, the world's second highest mountain. But Greg never made it to the top. After five days, he stumbled  into the village of Korphe in northern Pakistan, injured and hungry. The kind villagers there looked after him for several days.\nGreg saw that the villagers were very poor and hungry, and some of them were ill. Also, the village school didn't have a roof  and the children wrote on the ground with sticks, Greg knew he wanted to do something to help. \"I'll build you a school,\" he told the villagers. \"I promise.\"\nGreg went back home to the USA to raise money for the school. He even lived in the car to save money! Finally he went back to Korphe and built the school. But _ was just the beginning of something bigger! Since then, Greg's organization has built around 80 schools and runs many others in Pakistan and other countries, too.\nGreg hasn't finished yet. He does many other things to help people in poor countries. He has got many prizes, but it's the smiles of the children he has helped that makes him happy!\nGreg has just written a best-selling book about his story called Three Cups of Tea. It's an interesting and exciting book which tells us what ordinary people can do with courage and determination .", "id": "middle7594.txt"}
