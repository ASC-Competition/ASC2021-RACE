If you have after-school activities, the homework should be done first. At the same time, it is fine to allow for a snack break and also to allow for stretching breaks.\nAlso, you should remember that it is your duty to do your homework. Next time, when you want to depend on Mom and Dad for help, please try to find the answer yourself, because you will learn much, much more that way.\nWhen you have a question, especially something about a science or math, don't always turn to your teacher! It is a good idea to try to find the answer yourself. If this doesn't work, you can also look at the materials in the back of the book. They may guide you to the pages you should look at to help you understand the problem.\nFinally, while doing homework, don't think about or do other things. Keep working. Setting a time limit  often helps with this. Different ages decide different amounts of time. 10-15 minutes is good for a child that's aged 6-8. A time of 20-30 minutes is about right for a child aged 9-12. Kids can keep studying for 30-45 minutes from the ages of 13 to 15. This, of course, depends on your abilities to pay attention and stay on tasks.", "id": "middle390.txt"}
