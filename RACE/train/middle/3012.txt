I took the bus to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station. But I was refused every time. In one studio, a nice lady told me that big stations didn't want to accept inexperienced persons. \"Go to the countryside and find a small station that'll give you a chance,\" she said.\nI returned home, Dixon in Illinois. While there were no radio-announcing jobs in Dixon, my father said Smith Ward had opened a store and wanted a local sportsman to manage its sports department. Since I had played high school football in Dixon, I applied . The job sounded just right for me. But I still failed in the interview. At that moment, mom's words came to my mind: \"Everything happens for the best.\" Dad offered me a car to look for a job. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport in Iowa. The program director, named Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.\nAs I left his office, I felt sad. I asked aloud, \"How can a man become a sports announcer if he can't get a job in a radio station?\"\nI was waiting for the lift when I heard MacArthur calling, \"What did you say about sports? Do you know anything about football?\" Then he made me stand before a microphone and asked me to broadcast an imaginary game. As a result, I did a wonderful job and was told to broadcast Saturday's game!\nOn my way home, I thought of my mother's words again: \"Everything happens for the best if you carry on. One day something good will happen.\"", "id": "middle3012.txt"}
