The girl is called Danielle. She loves me very much. She puts beautiful clothes on me and combs   my hair every day.\nI look like a lady from the Tang Dynasty   in China. My clothes are red and blue. I wear golden shoes and small gold hair clips.\nDanielle is going to take me to Japan for the Doll Festival. I can see many dolls there. Sometimes I feel lonely   because I am Danielle's only doll and I never see other dolls. I want to talk with other dolls. I want to talk about our clothes, houses and lives. I want to ask the Japanese dolls a lot of questions. I want to ask the Kokeshi dolls   why they have no arms or legs! They are usually little girls. I like to talk to young dolls.\nDanielle says I can meet some boys' dolls at the festival too. I hope I can make friends with some of them.", "id": "middle6075.txt"}
