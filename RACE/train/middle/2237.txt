I think so.  Look around yourself. Fashion ads are almost everywhere.  Whether they have realized or not, a sea of. fashion is all around women.  They are made to think that without beautiful clothes they will look old and lose their charm . So who doesn't want to dress up to be beautiful and young?\nBut I don't agree with the opinion that women have to show their beauty through their looks.  Their mind can be more beautiful and attractive than their looks.  A woman has experienced many troubles and may be called \"aunt\", but she can still be beautiful if she has excellent qualities like knowledge, a kind heart and great courage .\nWhat's more,old and young,  beautiful and ugly are relative.  People who keep a young mind will never feel old.  Knowing about new things and wanting to learn more,they can keep up with fashion.  Simply dressed women are also beautiful in their own way.\nReading and learning is the best way to keep one young.  Good books can feed the flower of one's heart and looks.", "id": "middle2237.txt"}
