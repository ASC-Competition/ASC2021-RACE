They change their homes eleven times. Americans like change because they think it _ their lives.\nIn China, some people, of course, don't like change. They want life to be predictable . They want to do the same things every day and to see the same people every day. When something changes, it makes them feel uncomfortable, like a child who can't go to sleep unless all his toys are in their proper places.\nBut can't you see there are many changes in China? People are healthier and they are living longer. People have more money, more food and they are better educated .\nWithout change, our lives would be very boring. It would be like listening to the same song over and over again.
