Sometimes your knowledge is not enough, you also need good strategies. Here are some for you:\nBefore you answer the questions, if you feel a little nervous, take a few deep breaths to help you relax.  Always read the question carefully and make sure that you understand it. Read it a few times if possible.  Find out how much each question is worth or how many points you need.  If it asks to give one answer, only write one.\nIf there is a difficult question, don't worry. Go on to the next question and come back to it if you have time later.  Try not to leave questions unanswered when you finish the test. Sometimes a guess may get your points.\nWhen you finish, go back and check your answers. You will need to check your writing or spelling mistakes.", "id": "middle4842.txt"}
