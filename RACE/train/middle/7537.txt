They were upset that their child's kindergarten  teacher told them not to have high hopes for her. Standing behind them was Katherine, a beautiful five-year-old with long hair and dark eyes. The whole time her parents were there, she didn't make a sound or use sign language, even when her parents asked her to do so.\nAfter a few weeks with Katherine, I discovered she was a very smart child. Although she joined in different learning activities, writing was always a problem . I tried all kinds of ways to get her interested in writing, but she always refused to write.\nOne day Katherine got off the school bus and stood in front of the school crying. The teachers there did not know enough sign language to ask her what happened. Finally they led her into the office and gave her a pen and a piece of paper. Katherine wrote:\"PACBAK\". Then the teachers realized she had left her backpack on the bus. They called the bus driver back to school and soon Katherine got her backpack back.\nThat day _ . From then on she fell in love with writing. She is a young woman now and has become an excellent writer, public speaker and student leader.", "id": "middle7537.txt"}
