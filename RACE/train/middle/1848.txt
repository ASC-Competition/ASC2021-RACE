It was just standing there, with father standing on one side, and I on the other side.\nWe were both in great anger. \"Never set foot in this house again!\" stormed father. With tears  welling up in my eyes, I rushed out of the flat and ran along the street.\nThe street lights were shining, causing rather sad feelings. I walked aimlessly.\nA young father who held a child in his arms walked past me. I felt as if I saw my childhood from another space: happy and carefree.\nBut now ... I don't know whether it is because I have grown up or because dad is getting old.  We differ in our ways of thinking. He always puts his opinions of behavior on me. Whenever I do something wrong, he never turns a blind eye to it. We are just like two people coming from two different worlds. It feels like there is an iron door between us that can never be opened.\nI walked aimlessly on the streets, without an exact place in mind. My heart was frozen on this hot summer night.

I suddenly realized that there was no iron door between us at all. Love - it's second to none.", "id": "middle1848.txt"}
