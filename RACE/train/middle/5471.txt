Martin made a kind of machine--iCPooch. It allows pet owners to video chat with their pets and sends food from other places.2-1-c-n-j-y\nWhen a dog owner puts the iCPooch app on a phone, he or she can connect to the iCPooch machine at home and start talking. The owner's image  and voice will be on the screen. When the owner pushes a button on the iCPooch app, the machine will give the dog some food that has been stored inside the box.\nHow could Martin come up with the idea? The idea came to the Washington girl when she took a business class last year. That led her to think about helping her pet Kayla. Kayla always looked sad when she was left alone at home.\"I wanted to know how you could talk to your dog if you were not at home. And what if you were able to give them a treat while you were away?\" Martin explained her idea.\nNow Martin and her family have set up a company. They've had investments   from businessmen and asked a factory to make the product. They expected to sell 8,000 products by the end of 2015.\nMartin is satisfied  with her success. \"A year ago, I never thought that I would be able to start a business, or even having an idea for a business,\" she said. \"I've learned that we are supposed to hold on to your dreams.\"", "id": "middle5471.txt"}
