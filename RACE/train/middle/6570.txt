Every day they are busy earning money. They don't act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV. My father has a bad temper. When he's tired from the hard work, it is easy for him to lose his temper.\nOne day, my mother was sewing a quilt  .\n\"Mom, may I ask you a question?\" I said.\n\"What?\" \"Is there love between you and Dad?\" I asked her in a very low voice.\nMy mother stopped her work and raised her head in surprise. She didn't answer immediately. Then she continued to sew the quilt.\nI was very worried because I thought I had hurt her. But at last I heard my mother say the following words: \"Susan, look at the thread  . Sometimes it appears, but most of it disappears in the quilt. It makes the quilt strong. If life is a quilt, then love should be a thread. It can hardly be seen, but it's really there. Love is inside.\"\nI couldn't understand her until the next spring. My dad got sick suddenly. My mum had to stay with him in the hospital for a month. When they returned, they both looked very pale. _ .\nAfter they were back, every day in the morning and dusk, my mother helped my father walk slowly on the country road. The doctor had said my father would recover in two months. But after two months he still couldn't walk by himself. All of us were worried about him.\n\"Dad, how are you feeling now?\" I asked.\n\"Susan, don't worry about me,\" he said gently. \"I just like walking with your mom. I like this kind of life.\" Looking at his eyes, I knew he loves my mother deeply.\nOnce I thought love meant flowers, gifts and sweet kisses. But now, I understand that love is just like the thread. Love is inside, making life strong and warm.", "id": "middle6570.txt"}
