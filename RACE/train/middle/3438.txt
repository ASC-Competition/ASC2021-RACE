She was tired of watching TV, she read all her books, and her friends were on vacation. She wanted something different to do. Suddenly, she saw the lawn mower sitting in the yard.\n\"Mom,\" she shouted, ''I think I will mow the lawn.\" Her mom ran into the yard and said,\"Oh no, you don't. You're too young to mow the lawn.\"\n\"I'm fourteen years old and know how to do it,\" Jessie said. \"Besides, it would help Dad out, and he won't have to worry about it over the weekend.\"\nMom thought for a while and then decided to let Jessie give it a try. After all, she was home and would _ her. Jessie already knew how to start the lawn mower from watching her dad. Jessie checked the gas to make sure it was full, and put on her gardening gloves to protect her hands. Mom watched from the kitchen window. Jessie really does know how to mow the lawn. She was very careful around the flowers and trees. When she finished, she felt so good, but she was so hot. Mom brought her some ice tea and said, \"You really did a great job. Dad will be very surprised.\"\nLater that day, Dad came home and said to Jessie's mom, \"You didn't have to mow the lawn. I was going to do it on Saturday. It looks great. Thanks.\"\n\"I didn't mow it. Jessie did.\"\n\"Wow, our little girl is growing up!\" Dad told Jessie what a great job she had done.\n\"It was fun, and I will do it again next week,\" said Jessie.\nThe neighbor next door came by and asked Jessie if she wanted to mow his lawn and make some money. \"Sure!\" said Jessie. Jessie began mowing his lawn. Two other neighbors asked so, then another three. Jessie was now mowing lawns for them all and making some money. She was no longer bored! \"I won't have time to spend my money,\" she laughed to herself.", "id": "middle3438.txt"}
