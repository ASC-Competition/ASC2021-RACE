On the way, we spotted a man holding a piece of paper that said, \"Lost my job. Family to feed.\"\nAt this store, a sight like this is not normal. My 10-year-old noticed him and made a comment  on how bad it must be to have to stand outside in the cold wind.\nIn the store, I asked each of my kids to pick something they thought our \"friend\" there would appreciate. They got apples, a sandwich and a bottle of juice. Then my 17-year-old suggested giving him a gift card. I thought about _ . We were low on cash ourselves, but ... well, sometimes giving from our need instead of our abundance  is just what we need to do! All the kids declared  something they could do away with for the week.\nWhen we handed him the bag of food, he lit up and thanked us with watery eyes. When I handed him the gift card, saying he could use it for whatever his family might need, he burst into tears.\nThis has been a wonderful experience for our family. For days the kids have been looking for others we can help! Things would have played out so differently if I had simply said, \"No, we really don't have money to give more.\" Stepping out not only helped a brother in need, it also gave my kids the  _  taste of helping others. It'll go a long way with them.", "id": "middle7120.txt"}
