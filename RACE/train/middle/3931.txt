The young man laughed. \"Comparing your heart with mine, mine is perfect and yours is a mess of scars.\"\n\"Yes,\" said the old man, \"You see, every scar represents a person to whom I have given my love. I tear out a piece of my heart and give it to them, and often they give me a piece of their heart that fits into the empty place in my heart. Though it has some scars, I cherish . Because they remind me of the love we shared. Sometimes I have given pieces of my heart away, and the other person hasn't returned a piece of his or her heart to me. These are the empty gouges . Although these gouges are painful, they stay open, reminding me of the love I have for those people too, and I hope someday they may return and fill the space I have waiting. So now do you see what true beauty is?\"\nThe young man ripped a piece out of his perfect heart and offered it to the old man.
