One day, he went to the best school in the world. Before entering the gate, he was made to hand in all his weapons  .\n\"You won't need those any more. Here you'll get better ones,\" said the guard. Corky handed his weapons to him. A serious old teacher took Corky to his room. Before he left, he said to Corky, \"In a hundred days the training will start.\" A hundred days! At first Corky thought that was a joke, but he soon realized the old teacher had been serious. Corky felt nervous during the first days and he tried many ways to try to get the teacher to start the training. However, it didn't work. At last Corky waited patiently and enjoyed each day in the school.\n\"You've already learned how to use your main weapon - patience,\" said the old teacher. Corky could hardly believe it, but he really understood that the teacher was right. Finally, the lesson began. \"Now it's time to learn how to win every fight,\" said the old teacher. That sounded good to Corky until he found himself tied hand and foot. Many villagers tried to hit him because they were told that Corky was a dangerous man. The same thing was repeated for days, and Corky knew he had to do something. He realized that the only way would be to deal with the villagers' anger  . In the following days, Corky kept talking to them until he managed to make them believe that he was not an enemy. In the end, the villagers made friends with Corky.\nFinally, Corky knew what the most powerful weapon was. He said thanks to the teacher and left.", "id": "middle6957.txt"}
