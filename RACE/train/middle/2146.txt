I had so much fun. When we returned to school,my teacher told me to go to the headmaster's office. When I got into the office,I saw a police officer. Suddenly I realized something was wrong. The police officer told me what had happened and we went to pick my sister up. After that,we went to the hospital and waited. Time went slowly. Finally,we got to see our mother. It was terrible.\nOn the next day,the headmaster came and told my two teachers what had happened. I was taking a rest that day. I knew it had something to do with my mother. I kept thinking that she either died or had gotten better. How I wished that she had gotten better. When my teacher took me outside,my sister ran up to me. She started crying,\"She's gone. Teresa,mommy's gone.\nShe's dead.\" I couldn't believe it. We jumped into the car and drove straight to the hospital. Most of my family were there. The silence was terrible. I knew I had to say goodbye.\nToday when I look back,I still miss my mother very much,but I know that I will live. My mother was a strong mother,who had the biggest heart. My mother was an angel walking on the earth. I will always remember her as living. When someone is asked who their hero   is,they usually say someone famous,like Michael Jordan or Britney Spears. When someone asks me who my hero is,I tell them,my mother. My mother lives every day. That is what makes her a true hero.", "id": "middle2146.txt"}
