Green said, \"Clearly I am the most important. I am the sign of life and hope. Without me, all animals would die.\" Blue said, \"You only think about the earth instead of the sky and the sea. Without my peace, you would all be nothing. \" Yellow laughed, \"You are all so serious. I bring fun and warmth into the world. \" Orange shouted, \"1 am the colour of health and strength. I am the most important for I serve the needs of people' s life. \" Red shouted out, \"I am the most important of all. I am the colour of danger, bravery and love. I am brave to fight for truth. \" Then Purple and Indigo came...\nThe colours went on quarrelling, each saying he or she was the most important. Their quarrelling became louder and louder. Suddenly it thundered and rained hard. The colours felt so frightened that they stopped quarrelling and got together for comfort .\nAt this time, rain began to speak, \"You foolish colours, quarrelling among yourselves, each tried to be the most important. You don' t know that you each were made for a special purpose? Join hands with each other and come to me. \"\nDoing as they were told, the colours united   and joined hands. They formed a colourful rainbow. From then on, when a good rain washes the world, a rainbow appears in the sky. They begin to appreciate  each other.", "id": "middle3687.txt"}
