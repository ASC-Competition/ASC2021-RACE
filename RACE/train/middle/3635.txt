The rules change from one school to another. Some schools are much stricter than others. There are also some rules that are strange or funny to us. Here are some funny school rules:\nStrict Japanese rules\nMost schools ask students to wear uniforms, such as sports suits or skirts. But Japanese schools even have rules about the colour of underwear ! They also require  that girls' socks should be folded  in a certain way and boys' heads should be shaved .\nOther Japanese schools tell students that they can't go to the movies after sunset.\nDifferent shoes in the USA\nAt some American schools, students have to change their shoes when they go into the schools every day. This makes sure students won't fall over on the floors and keeps the schools clean.\nNo strange hair in the UK\nStrange hairstyles are not allowed in some British schools. But they might allow students to wear certain hairstyles during the World Cup years. There were two students who had special hairstyles during the 2002 World Cup. After the World Cup, their teachers asked them to go to the barber's  at once.", "id": "middle3635.txt"}
