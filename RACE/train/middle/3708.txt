When their living place dries up, they live. on the land, said Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida.\nThe fish can grow as large as three inches. They group together and breathe air through their skin before they can find water again.\nThe new scientific discovery came during a trip.\n\"We were travelling for fun. and one day I kicked over a log   and the fish came out,\" Taylor told reporters by telephone. He said he would make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year.\nIn lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating.\nSome other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish  found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University.\nMore studies of the fish may tell how animals changed over time.\n\"These animals live in conditions similar to those millions of years ago, when animals began to move from water onto land,\" Wright said.", "id": "middle3708.txt"}
