Between then and now many changes will take place. What will the changes be?\nThe population is growing fast. There will be more people in the world and most of them will live longer than people do now.\nComputers will be much smaller and more useful, and there will be at least one in every home. And computer studies will be one of the important subjects in schools then.\nPeople will work fewer hours than they do now and they will have more free time for sports, watching TV and traveling. Traveling will be much easier and cheaper. More people will go to other countries on holiday.\nThere will be changes in our food, too. Maybe no one will eat meat every day. Instead, they eat more fruit and vegetables. Maybe people will be healthier.\nWork in the future will be different, too. Dangerous and hard work canl be done by robots, because of this, many people will not have work to do. This will be a problem.", "id": "middle4250.txt"}
