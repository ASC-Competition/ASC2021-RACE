Unluckily, I am one of them. I have visited a place many times but I may still get lost there the next time.\nWhen I was a little girl, I never dared to ask strangers the way. And so I used to walk around in circles and hope that by chance I would get to the place I was going to.\nNow, I am no longer too shy to ask people for directions, but I often receive helpless or even wrong information. So I try to avoid giving people wrong directions. If anyone ever asks me the way somewhere, I would say, \"Sorry, I am a stranger here.\"\nOnce on my way to work I was stopped by a man. He asked me if I could tell him the way to the Friendship Building. I gave him my usual reply. But just as I walked on only a few steps. I realized that he had asked the way to my office building. However, I had no time to turn back and look for him. I was rushing to meet with someone at my office and I didn't want to keep him waiting.\nWhen I just got to my office, the secretary  showed in the man who had asked me for directions. Imagine how _ I was and how surprised he was when we saw each other at the first sight.", "id": "middle2977.txt"}
