The son said, \"Well, we have one dog and they have four. We have a pool in our garden, while they have a river that has no end. We have expensive lanterns  , but they have stars above their heads at night. We have only a small piece of land to live on, while they have the endless fields. We buy our food, but they grow theirs.
