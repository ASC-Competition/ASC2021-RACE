Nine people lost their lives and 23 people were injured. For those people, it was a night- mare!\nTo learn a lesson, we must know who caused the accident and why.\nThe answer looks obvious. It's the car owner's fault because she drove her car into the people. However, is that true? Is that her fault? What about the dead and injured people? Did they have their own faults as well? The answer is yes.\nAccording to news reports, at that time, many people were standing in the turning section of the viaduct watching the airplanes take off and land. Suddenly, a car appeared. Maybe the car owner got nervous, so she mistakenly stamped on the accelerator instead of the brake pedal, which caused the accident.\nIn my opinion, of course the driver should be blamed because she caused the accident. However, for those dead and injured people, although we feel sorry for them, they have their own responsibilities as well. They should have been aware of their own safety. They shouldn't have been standing in a dangerous place to watch the airplanes take off and land.", "id": "middle5461.txt"}
