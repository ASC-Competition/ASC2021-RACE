People of many countries do so, too. It is a very good habit .\nYou should say \"Thank you\" when someone passes you the salt on the table, when someone walking ahead of you keeps the door open for you, when someone says you have done your work well, or you have bought a nice thing, or your city is very beautiful. \"Thank you\" is used not only between friends, but also between parents and children, brothers and sisters.\n\"Excuse me\" is another short sentence they use. When you hear someone say so behind you, you know that somebody wants to walk past you without touching you. It's not polite to break others when they are talking.
