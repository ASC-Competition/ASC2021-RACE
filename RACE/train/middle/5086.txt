Although it may sound impossible, there's a growing community that is making that dream one step closer.\nThe community is called Couchsurfing. The idea is that people open their homes up to travelers for free, and in exchange both people will learn from each other.\nInstead of paying a lot of money staying in hotels, living with locals is both cheap and authentic . Maybe you'll find a hidden attraction in the city. It may be a good place where people like to visit. This is also your chance to ask what life in their country is really like.\nIt also works as a culture exchange. For example,if you play the guitar and your host is a great cook, teach him or her how to play to say thank you for the dinner. This type of exchange is popular.\nBut what are some manners of being a good Couchsurfer? First, be careful about cultural taboos . For example, if you eat with Indians, never use your left hand. In Indian culture, left hands are used for the toilet. Also, when you are going to leave, it's a good idea to prepare a small gift. This shows your _ to the home owner.\nNow, are you ready to travel like a local? Where will you surf first?", "id": "middle5086.txt"}
