As we know, once the number of boys was larger than that of girls, and the boys did much better than girls in our country for a long time. Now things have changed a lot.\nIn recent years, the proportion of girl students is growing fast. In 1998, about 39.7% of college students were girls. In 2000, it was 41.07% and in 2001, the number was 42.14%.\nThere are several reasons for this.\nFirstly, there is little difference between boys and girls in their intelligence . That's to say, girls are as clever as boys. And boys have more interests than girls, so they may not do well in their study.\nSecondly, girls are more careful and more sensible than boys. They work harder at school and they do better in all exams.\nAnother reason is that with the development of society, people pay more and more attention to girls' education.", "id": "middle574.txt"}
