It is called \"Auld Lang Syne\" (<<>> ). It is the traditional music played during New Year's celebration. \"Auld Lang Syne\" is an old Scottish poem. It tells about the need to remember old friends.\nThe words \"auld lang syne\" mean \"old long since\". No one knows who wrote the poem first.\nHowever, a version by Scottish poet Robert Burns was published in 1796. The words and music we know today first appeared in a song book three years later.\nThe song is played in the United States mainly on New Year's Eve. The version you are hearing today is by the Washington Saxophone Quartet. One of the 4 musicians in the group is VOA's Rich Kainfaite. As we end our programme with \"Auld Lang Syne\",I would like to wish all of our radio friends a very happy New Year! This is Buddy Thomas.", "id": "middle7492.txt"}
