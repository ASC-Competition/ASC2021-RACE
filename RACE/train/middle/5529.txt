On March 4th, he arrived there. He rented   a bike to travel around the town in the day. He visited some places of interest and had lunch in a restaurant. He had a good time. In the evening he stayed at an old hotel   near the train station.\nBefore going to bed, he went to the boss   of the hotel and said to the old man, \"Excuse me, sir. Will you please wake me up at a quarter to five? I must take the five o'clock train tomorrow morning.\"\n\"Oh, sorry,\" the boss said, \"I'm sorry I can't. I never get up so early.\"\n\"Do you have a clock? That can help me,\" asked Mike.\n\"Yes, here it is.\"\nMike took the clock to his room. But when he looked at the clock, he found it didn't work.
