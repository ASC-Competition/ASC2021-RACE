Her name was Minnie.\nIn the letter, Minnie wrote, \"I am really sorry about before. Tell me if you will be my best friend again and tell me if you accept my _ . \"I wrote, \"YES. I will be your best friend. \"\nThe twelve-year-old letter made me remember the time that Minnie and I spent together. We often wrote to each other during that time. One minute, Minnie and I would be playing happily together; the other moment we would get into arguments. But things would always be better again. She gave me a doll for my tenth birthday.
