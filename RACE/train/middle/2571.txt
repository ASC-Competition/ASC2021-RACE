Here are some answers from some students.\nMary: If we don't take good care of the earth now, our children and grandchildren will be born into a world with much pollution . There will be fewer trees and more buildings, because there will be more people.\nJack: I agree with Mary. Things will be worse . The weather in the future will be much hotter. Humans won't be able to live on the earth. They will have to look for another planet to live on.\nLinda: I think the life in the future will be better.
