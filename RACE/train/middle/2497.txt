My story?\"\n\"Yes, What were you doing like a fly on that wall, Mr. Crane?\"\n\"Well, I had a breakdown yesterday and had to stay the night here. The landlady's name is Mrs. Fern. She gave me breakfast at seven, and I was out of here in the right way and down at the lorry park by half past seven. It was only when I felt around for a cigarette that I realized I'd left $80 under the pillow  here. It's a habit I've got into. I even do it almost every day.\"\n\"I see. Why didn't you miss it when you meant to pay Mrs.? What's her name?\"\n\"I paid her last night. You've got to pay when you take the room, see? So I came rushing back, but it's Sunday, and she'd gone back to bed. I rang the bell and banged on the front door for ten minutes before I came round here. Up I went this pipe  and the money was still there. You know the rest, and I hope you believe it because....\"\n\"Mr. Crane, whatever are you doing here? I thought you'd gone an hour ago.\" It was Mrs. Fern.", "id": "middle2497.txt"}
