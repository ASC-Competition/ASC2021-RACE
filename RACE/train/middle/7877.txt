He was good and kind. He was ready to go and help people. People always went to him when they were ill.\nMany years later, the doctor began to forget things. The people were afraid and little by little, they stopped going to him. The doctor saw his business   wasn't as good as before. He thought, \"Well, if I were the patients(people who don't feel well), I'd be afraid to go to me too. Maybe it's time for me to stop being a doctor. But if this town has no doctor, what will the people do when they become ill?\"\nHis wife heard him talking to himself and said, \"Why don't you find a young doctor _ ? Then people will have another good doctor to take care of them and I will get my husband back.\"\nThe doctor did as what his wife said. He found a very good young doctor to help the people. The doctor and his wife then had time to take long walks together, go dancing, go traveling and spend the rest of their days together.", "id": "middle7877.txt"}
