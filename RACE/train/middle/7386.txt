A singing robot is being taught to create jazz with human being in a project.\nAntonio Chella from Italy is working with a Telenoid robot. To start with, the Telenoid will be trained to _ the movements and simple sounds made by a human singer, and then connect music with different human emotions.\nPrevious  robots had the ability to find common connections between things. But Chella suggests that a conscious  robot should be able to go a step further and find new connections. The Telenoid is of this kind.\n\"This work raises interesting questions about the connection between consciousness and music creating.\" says Philippe Pasquier, a musician needs a physical body.\nPasquer argues that the robot musician is faced with a big challenge. \"Its software has already been developed and it can imitate The Beatles, a famous band. However, what made The Beatles famous were not only their songs but their wonderful performance of the songs,\" he says.\nIt is not clear how a robot would perform music a new way. But by imitating humans, the Telenoid robot could provide some useful information. What is important is that human musicians often listen to and compare music made by others for a long time before creating music of their own. So the Telenoid robot had better listen to more jazz music first.", "id": "middle7386.txt"}
