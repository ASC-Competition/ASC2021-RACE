Such an opinion is supported by a research group at Tongji University. _ did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings for three years. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. \"People are likely to ignore  the light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear,\" said Ni Ying, a member of the research team.\nHowever, a survey on Sina Weibo suggested that people jaywalk mainly because they ignore rules. \"I always obey traffic rules. Time is important but safety should come first,\" someone wrote on his Weibo.\nMany countries give out punishments to jaywalkers. In Singapore, the maximum can be three months in prison . Some Chinese cities have started taking some actions, too. For example, the first three people in a jaywalking group will be fined 50 yuan in Shijiazhuang.\nBut calling on people to obey rules is more important. To completely solve the problem, everyone should understand the importance of obeying the traffic rules.", "id": "middle7791.txt"}
