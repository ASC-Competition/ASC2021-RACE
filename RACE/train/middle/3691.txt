Some students' mobile phones are stolen, some students fight with and hurt one another, and others are knocked down by the fast running bikes or cars.\nThese problems arc common on campus. I think there are three causes for these. Firstly, some students do not take good care of their properties. They are still young and not careful enough. Secondly, some students want to do everything well. They want to be the winners in exams, and they also want to be the winners in fightings.  And thirdly, the campus guards do not carry on their duties well. They don' t regulate the traffic in the busy hour.\nIn order to have a secure campus, all the students should be very careful about their properties. They should also mind their behaviors  and act politely. The campus guards are supposed to be devoted  to the security on campus, and it is their duty to safeguard  a secure campus to help provide a good environment for the students.", "id": "middle3691.txt"}
