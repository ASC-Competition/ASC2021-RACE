Today, many teenagers are overweight, and this is because of their bad eating habits. Most teenagers are fond of food with a lot of fat, oil, salt and sugar. People call this kind of food \"junk food\".\nBut bad eating habits go beyond fast food. We find many teenagers eat unhealthily. Some don't have breakfast before they go to school. During the day, some don't have a proper meal for lunch. In a recent survey at one school, scientists found that over two thirds of the students didn't follow a healthy diet. They didn't like vegetables, and many of them didn't like to eat fruits. They preferred to eat food with a lot of salt, sugar, or fat.\nParents today also worry about their children's diet. Some doctors give the following advice:\nTeenagers shouldn't eat too much junk food.\nTeenagers shouldn't eat food with too much salt. Salt can cause high blood pressure in the future.\nTeenagers should eat food without much fat, oil and sugar.\nTeenagers need to eat some fruits and vegetables every day.
