I have always felt I was quite able to do everything by myself. But now I know I was wrong.\nSometimes you really need help in life, I guess. And that's why I'm writing this letter to you.\nI have a happy family. I love my children and they love me . I'm a mother of three children. I know well how to bring up  children, and two of them are already over twenty, so it is nothing new for me.\nBut now I have a serious problem: the Internet problem. My little son is just sixteen, and I feel he should do a lot of homework now , but he doesn't seem to be interested in it . He can happily spend six or eight hours at a time on the Internet every day , He chats with people that he has never met before , but speaks little to us .He does lots of useless things on the Internet. And he sees red if you ask him to do his homework.\nI just want him to be a good student . Now he seldom does his lessons at home. I'm afraid he will drop behind in his class soon. His father is a doctor , a very kind man . He never seems to be afraid of his father.\nWhat can I do ?And don't tell to talk to him. We've tried that and it didn't work. But this is really a big problem in our family. I have tried everything I can think of . I\nwonder how the Internet is so attractive .You're my last hope. Please tell me what I can do!\nYours,\nEllen Smith", "id": "middle2192.txt"}
