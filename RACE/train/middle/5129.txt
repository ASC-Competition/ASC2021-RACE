Felipe didn't want Donna to die.\nFelipe talked to his mother about Donna. \"I am going to die,\" Felipe told his mother, \"and I am going to give my heat to Donna.\"\nFelipe's mother didn't pay much attention to Felipe. \"Felipe is just kidding,\" she thought, \"Felipe is not going to die. He's strong and healthy.\"\nBut Felipe was not healthy. He had terrible headaches sometimes. \"my head hurts,\" he often told his friends. Felipe never told his parents about his headaches.\nOne morning Felipe woke up with a sharp pain in his head. He was dizzy  , and he couldn't breathe. His parents rushed Felipe to the hospital. Doctors at the hospital had terrible news for them. \"Felipe' s brain is dead,\" the doctors said, \"we can't save him.\"\nThe parents were very sad. But they remembered Felipe's words. \"Felipe wanted to give his heart to Donna,\" they told the doctors.\nThe doctors did several tests. Then they told the parents, \"we can give Felipe's heart to Donna.\"\nThe doctors took out Felipe's heart and rushed the heart to Donna. Other doctors took out Donna's heart and put Felipe's heart in her chest. In a short time the heart began to beat.\nThe operation was a success. Felipe's heart was beating in Donna's chest, but Donna didn't know it. Her parents and doctors didn't tell her. They waited until she was stronger; then they told her about Felipe. \"I feel very sad,\" Donna said, \"but I am thankful to Felipe.\"\nThree months later the operation Donna went back to school. She has to have regular checkups, and she has to take medicine every day. But she is living a normal life.\nFelipe's brother John says, \"Every time we see Donna, we think of Felipe. She has Felipe's heart in her. That gives us great peace.\"", "id": "middle5129.txt"}
