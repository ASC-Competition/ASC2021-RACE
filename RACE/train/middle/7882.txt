They knew how big it was and how far away it was from the earth. But they wanted to know more about it .They thought and thought. At last they found the only way to know more was to send men to the moon.\nThe moon is about three hundred and eighty-four thousand kilometers away from the earth. A plane can not fly to the moon because the air reaches only 240 kilometers. Then there is no air. But something can fly even when there is no air. That is a rocket.\nHow does a rocket fly? There is gas in the rocket. When the gas is made very hot inside the rocket, it will rush out of the end of the rocket, so it can make the rocket fly up into the sky.\nRockets can fly far out into space. Rockets with men in them have already reached the moon. Some rockets without men in them have flown to other planets much farther away than the moon. One day rockets may be able to go to any place.\n,A, B, C, D,.", "id": "middle7882.txt"}
