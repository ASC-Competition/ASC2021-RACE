He's taught maths in a middle school for twenty years. He works and always comes to his office on time. He hopes his students will be honest and he is strict with them. Some of his students have become famous persons, but they still remember him and often write to him. Of course the man is proud of them.\nThis term he began to teach Grade One. Some of the new students were told about him, but the others didn't know about him. On the first day of school he told the students how to be an honest person. He gave them some examples and said, \"I don't like telling a lie.\" Before class was over, he told all his students to finish Exercise 8 in Lesson 1.\nThe next morning, as soon as he came into the classroom, he asked. \"Who's finished Exercise 8?\" A few students raised their hands. He shook his head and said. \"Open your workbooks and see if there's Exercise 8 in Lesson 1.\"\nThe students had a look at their workbooks and their faces turned red at once.", "id": "middle4029.txt"}
