But she has a hard time in P.E. class. She is not good at jumping very far, she has trouble throwing a ball, and she can't run really fast. Sometimes, some kids make fun of   her. So why does Kelly love P.E. class?\nThe reason is that her teacher Mr. Burns always tells her to do her best. Though she only runs for a few minutes, Mr. Burns says, \"Good job! Next time you will be able to go a little longer.\" Mr. Burns even put a small box on the floor so Kelly would be able to practice jumping over it.\nThat night when Kelly finished dinner, she put three boxes and began practicing jumping over them. She made it! Kelly thought to herself, \"Tomorrow I will be able to jump over those boxes in P.E. class.\"\nAnd sure enough, Kelly jumped over three boxes in class the next day. The other kids said to her, \"Good job!\"\nThere was a relay race   on Tuesday. Kelly was scared that she would not be able to go very far. But when Mr. Burns said, \"Ready! Set! Go!\", Kelly thought to herself, \"I can do it.\" When Kelly ran around the track  , she heard many cheers and kids shouting, \"Go Kelly! You can do it!\" That was all she needed to hear. Kelly ran fast. She finished first! The kids cheered for her. Kelly felt so good. \"Thank you Mr. Burns,\" said Kelly. \"Kelly, you ran the race, not me.\" \"Yes, but you always said I could do it.\"", "id": "middle4984.txt"}
