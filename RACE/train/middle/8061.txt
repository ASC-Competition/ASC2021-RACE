They have nothing to eat for days.\"\nI took some food and went. When I finally came to the family, I saw the ugly face of those little children by hunger. There was no sorrow   or sadness in their faces, just the deep pain of hunger.\nI gave the rice to the mother. She divided  it into two, and went out, carry half the rice with her. When she came back, I asked her, \"Where did you go?\" She gave me this simple answer, \"To my neighbours----they are also hungry.\"\nI was not surprised that she gave----because poor people are unselfish . But I was surprised that she knew they were hungry. As a rule, when we are in trouble, we think more about ourselves, and have no time for others.", "id": "middle8061.txt"}
