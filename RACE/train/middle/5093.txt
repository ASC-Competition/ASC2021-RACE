And in each lunch I packed, I left a note. The note might be a thank-you for a special moment, or a few words of encouragement for the coming test or sporting event.\nWhen they were little, they loved their notes. And when I went back to teaching, they even put notes in my lunches. As they grew older, my elder son, Marc, told me that he no longer needed my daily notes. Telling him that he no longer needed to read them but I still needed to write them, I continued the tradition until the day he graduated.\nSix years after high school graduation, Marc called and asked if he could stay at home for a couple of months. He had spent those years well, and he was very successful. He lived far away from home. With his younger sister leaving for college, I was especially looking forward to seeing Marc at home.\nSince I was still making lunch every day for his younger brother, I packed one for Marc, too. Imagine my surprise when I got a call from my 24-year-old son, complaining   about his lunch.\n\"Did I do something wrong? Aren't I still your kid? Don't you love me any more, Mom?\" he asked.\nI laughingly asked him what was wrong.\n\"My note, Mom,\" he answered. \"Where's my note?\"\nThis year my younger son will be in high school. He, too, has said that he is too old for notes. But like his elder brother and sister, he will receive those notes till the day he graduates.", "id": "middle5093.txt"}
