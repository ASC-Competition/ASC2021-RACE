In the evening, I like listening to some talk programmes. The host's   beautiful voice makes me relax. The host often has the same feelings as the audience about love, friendship, life and so on. I am often moved   to tears. I usually go to bed at 9:30 pm and then I begin to listen to the play on the radio in bed. I can only listen to the sound, but I am always interested in guessing who they are and what they look like. I often fall asleep while listening. During lunch and supper time, I listen to the radio, too.\nI like listening to music because it can make me quiet. I also like thinking about something while listening to music, for example, what I shall do tomorrow, that I have to call my family tonight and that I should send short messages to my friends on Christmas Day.\nYou see, radio is important in my life, like a friend.", "id": "middle931.txt"}
