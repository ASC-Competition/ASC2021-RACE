But now do you find a real friendship and keep it?\nAn American writer tells young students some smart ways to find friends. He says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed  and take care of it to make it grow.\nFirst, to make friends, you must be kind and friendly to others. You should learn to smile at others and try to make a stranger feel at home. _ .\nSecond, friends should negotiate  instead of quarrel . When you don't agree with someone, please discuss with him or her. But even the best friends can quarrel. After the quarrel, you have to talk to him or her.

Tell him or her how you are feeling, and explain why you did this or that.\nFinally, never believe in those who leave you when you are in trouble. And never leave your friend when he or she is in trouble. Remember, a friend in need is a friend indeed.", "id": "middle6005.txt"}
