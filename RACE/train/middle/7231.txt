At the moment we're staying near Uluru--that's the aboriginal  name for Ayers Rock. On the first day, we took a balloon tour over the rock, and I was surprised at how big it was: 3.6 kilometers long and 384 meters high. The colors of the rock are fantastic, and at different times of the day, they change from purple to red. The Aborigines are the first people of Australia, and the ancient aboriginal stories describe the spirits that created the world. Uluru is a center of Aboriginal culture.\nThe Australians have many British relatives. That's why they're like us in many ways. Their family life is similar to ours, and they enjoy the same food and hobbies. The food and drink that most Australians like are grapes, lamb, ham and especially wine that they make in the south of the country. They love all sports, but football is the most popular. Most Australians live near the coast, so they also love going to the beach, swimming and surfing.\nAlthough it's December, it's summer over here. The sunshine is very bright, and near the coast the countryside is very green. There are lots of sheep in the fields and on the hills, but the outback  is more like a desert, full of rocks and sand.\nThe next day after we arrived at Uluru, we went on a camel  ride. The camel that I rode had a bad _ . When I sat on its back, it became very angry and refused me. So everyone else thought it was very funny that my camel kept lying down...\nFinally, later this evening, we're taking the plane back to Sydney and coming home, it's been a fantastic trip!\nTony", "id": "middle7231.txt"}
