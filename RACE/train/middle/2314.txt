It was very easy, and it was really good.\nDavid: I use the Internet for games. I play chess with people all around the world. Last night I had a game with someone from Japan. I also download  games from the Internet, so I can have any game I want.\nPeter: I use the Internet for anything I need to help me with my schoolwork. I use the online dictionaries, encyclopedias  and magazines. It's great because I can download pictures or articles and use them to help my homework. It's very easy to use and it's free, so I like it.\nTony: Well, the main thing I use the Internet for is to e-mail. I usually write to my customers  by e-mail, and my customers answer me by e-mail, too. We probably send and receive four or five hundred e-mails a month. But of course, I also use e-mails to keep in touch  with friends and family. My daughter is in Australia and we send e-mails to each other every day.", "id": "middle2314.txt"}
