When learning English becomes a kind of habit, everything will become easier.\nPlease think about how we learned to ride a bicycle. There are four stages  : At the first stage, the child doesn't know what it is to ride a bicycle, nor can he ride. So look at ourselves, when we learned English at the first time, we were also in this condition.\nAnd then is the second stage. Although the child cannot ride himself, he grows and understands what it is to ride a bicycle. So, at this time, teachers are our navigation   marks.\nSo according to this, we are just like the child starting to learn and now come to the third stage. He can ride a bicycle but has to think every time how to do it.\nAt last, the fourth stage comes when the child has practiced consciously   riding the bicycle so much that he doesn't have to think. Riding a bicycle becomes a kind of habit. He can talk to people and wave   to others while riding.\nLearning English is just like learning to ride a bicycle. When learning becomes a kind of habit, we'll find we can be successful not only in English but also in other subjects. When learning becomes a kind of habit, I think, no, I believe, one day we'll succeed and the success will belong to us forever.\n,,.", "id": "middle7868.txt"}
