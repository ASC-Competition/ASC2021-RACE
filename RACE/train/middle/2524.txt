I took my 6-year-old daughter's hand and we started to walk around. Suddenly she reached out her hand to touch a pair of shiny black shoes.\n\"Buy for me?\" she asked.\n\"Oh, Sweetie, they are tap dancing   shoes. You aren't taking tap dance.\"\n\"Buy for me?\" she repeated.\n\"Well, let's try them on.\"\nShe sat on the floor and took off her bright pink rain boots. When she stood up we heard \"click\". She took a step, \"click, click, click.\"\nThe sun came out and we went on our way. Our next stop was the grocery store. \"Click, click, click...\" people turned to look as we entered the store. People would never allow their daughter to wear tap dancing shoes to the grocery store.\n\"Excuse me, dear. Why would you allow  your daughter to wear tap dancing shoes here? They make such a noise.\"\n\"Isn't it wonderful?\"\n\"Wonderful? My dear, this is not the place to wear those shoes.\"\n\"You don't understand. When she was a baby, doctors told us that she would never walk or talk. It has taken a lot of hard work and patience, but she asked for the shoes and the 'click, click, click' says that she can walk,\" I said.\nMy daughter is 18 now and will graduate from grade 12 in June. It has not always been easy, but it has all been worthwhile  . She has taught me that it doesn't matter what others think. _", "id": "middle2524.txt"}
