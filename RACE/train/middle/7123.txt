In summer, many people step on honey bees and get stung  while walking without wearing shoes.\nHoney bees are normally about third fourths of an inch long. Most bees are workers, which are female, but some are male, called \"drones \". Workers are a little smaller than drones.\nHoney bees live in a nest, called a \"hive\". A hive can have up to 80,000 bees, mostly workers. It usually lies in a tree with a hole inside.\nThe hive is ruled  over by a queen bee. She is the largest bee in the hive, and she is the only female to mate. Males usually just hang around; their only purpose is to mate with the queen. Then they die. The workers do all of the work inside and outside of the hive. Their jobs include: caring for baby bees, cleaning up the hive, making honey...\nHoney bees are usually very friendly, and they mind their own business.
