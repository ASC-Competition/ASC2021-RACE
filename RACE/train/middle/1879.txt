Their father went to a town far away. Before leaving, he said he would write to them as soon as he found a job there. But two months passed, they did not hear from him. Now they had nothing except the old house and they had no money to buy any food. They thought for a long time. Then they decided to sell the house and look for their father. So one day the two brothers said goodbye to their friends and started to go. They got to the station and bought two tickets.\nThey were afraid that they would be hungry in the train, so they went to the market to buy something to eat. They saw bananas for the first time.

Just at that moment the train went into a tunnel  and it was dark in the train. He was afraid and called out,\"Have you taken a bite of your bananas, Bruno?\"\n\"Not yet.\"\n\"That's good.\"Bruce said, crying,\"I did and went blind!\"", "id": "middle1879.txt"}
