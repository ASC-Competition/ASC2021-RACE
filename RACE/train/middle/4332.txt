Yet no one really understands why flowers open and close like this at particular times. It is not as simple as we might think, as new experiments have shown. In one experiment, flowers were kept in darkness. We might expect that the flowers, without any information about the time of the day, did not open as they usually do. In fact, they continued to open at their usual time. This shows that they have some mysterious   way of knowing the time.\nTheir sense of time does not depend on information from the outside world; it is, so to speak, inside them, a kind of \"inner clock\". This discovery may not seem to be very important. However, it was later found that not just plants but also animals including man have this \"inner clock\"which controls working of their bodies and their activities.\nHuman beings, then, are also controlled by this mysterious power. Whether we wish it or not, it affects such things in our life as our need for sleep, our need for food. And our ability to concentrate .", "id": "middle4332.txt"}
