When the children give it a push and jump in for their first ride, smiles of wonder appears on their faces.\nThe fun of going round and round in a circle is just part of the wonder. The wonderful invention doesn't only change the kids' play time, but also makes a big difference to the people's lives.\nAs the merry-go-round starts, _ pumps clean water up from deep underground and keeps it in a huge tank . People are welcomed to come and help themselves to get the water for free. They are very happy these days.\nIn the countryside of Africa, very few people could drink clean water. They don't have machines that can get water in their homes. Instead, they often walk a long way to carry water back.\nPatricia Molope, a fifteen-year-old girl, explains that before her village in South Africa got a PlayPump, people would pay a taxi driver to take them to a well far from their homes. \" Sometimes the taxi drivers were so busy that we would have to stop taking showers in order to save water. It was so far to walk there, but at present we have our own clean water in the village, and the life is better, too.\"\nThe hard job of carrying water usually is done by women and girls. Carrying water for miles and hours each day is such a heavy job that it sometimes prevents girls from being able to go to school.\nThanks to the PlayPump, getting water is quicker and easier-----and even boys join in. The pumps have become a new activity. Kids and adults seem to love playing with them while collecting water.\nA boy named Khumalo, twelve years old, says, \" I have seen many kinds of water pumps, but have never seen one that can keep water. When I grow up, I want to be an inventor so I can also invent clever things like the PlayPump that will help my country.\"\nSo far, more than 800 PlayPumps are being operated in schools and neighborhoods in four African countries, providing water for almost two million people.", "id": "middle7014.txt"}
