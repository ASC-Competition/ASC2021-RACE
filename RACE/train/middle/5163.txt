I enjoyed the time in the plane because I knew a friendly man there. He was from Italy, but we had no problem _ with each other. We both talked in English.\nWhen I got to Finland, I visited Espoo, Oulu, Lahti and Tampere. The people there were very friendly. I also spent a lot of time in Helsinki -- the capital of Finland. People also called it the daughter of the sea. It was very clean. There I watched the Baltic Sea. It was very beautiful. One night, I went to the theatre to see a very interesting local play. Everything was OK but the sun, because the sunset   there was too early.\nI had a very nice time in this country and I want to travel to it again.", "id": "middle5163.txt"}
