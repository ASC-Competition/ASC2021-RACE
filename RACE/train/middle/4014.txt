Those allowed to take a nap and who also remembered dreaming of the task, found their way to a landmark   quicker.\nThe researchers think the dreams are a sign that unconscious  parts of the brain are working hard to process information about the task.\nDr. Robert Stickgold of Harvard Medical School, said dreams may be a marker that the brain is working on the same problem at many levels.\nStudy tips\nCo-author Dr. Erin Wamsley said the study suggests our non-conscious brain works on the things that it deem   are the most important.\n\"Every day we are gathering lots of information and new experiences,\" she said. \"It would seem that our dreams are asking the question, \"How do I use this information to inform  my life?\"\nThe scientists say there may be ways to use this phenomenon for improving learning and memory. For example, students might be better studying hard before bedtime, or taking a nap after a period of afternoon study.", "id": "middle4014.txt"}
