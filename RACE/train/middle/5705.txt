That night when everyone went to bed, Bunny couldn't sleep. He still couldn't think of what he wanted his special Christmas gift to be. He wondered how Santa Claus would know what to bring him if he didn't know himself.\nAs he was sitting up in bed , Bunny heard a big noise on the roof and a sound downstairs. It was Santa Claus, he realized. Bunny jumped out of bed and raced down the hall to the stairs hoping to have a look at the old man with his own eyes.\nBy the time Bunny reached the bottom of the stairs, though, everything was again silent .Beautiful gifts were piled  under the Christmas tree, but Santa Claus was gone. He looked for him for a few minutes, but it was already too late. Bunny turned to climb back upstairs when he heard a cry.\n\"Hello,\" said Bunny. \"Is somebody there?\"\nHe was answered by another cry. Bunny looked around the big pile of gifts to see what was making the noise. Right under the tree was a funny looking brown animal with big feet and sad eyes. Bunny might have mistaken it for a dog, if it hadn't been for the antlers  on its head.\n\"Are you a reindeer?\" asked Bunny.\n\"Yes,\" replied the animal, \"my name is Ralph.\"\n\"And you were pulling Santa's sled ?\"\n\"I was until I got air-sick,\" replied Ralph,\" I'm afraid I wasn't _ the job. Now I'm stuck here and I don't know how to get back to the North Pole.\"\n\"Well, if you like, you can stay with us as a friend,\" said Bunny. As he made the offer, Bunny suddenly realized the gift he wanted from Santa Claus was a new friend!", "id": "middle5705.txt"}
