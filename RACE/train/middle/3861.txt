He asks the students, \"Is the bottle full?\"\nThey all answer, \"Yes!\"\nThe teacher then puts some small stones into the bottle. The small stones are between the big stones. He then asks, \"Is it full now?\"\nSome students give no answer, but most answer, \"Yes!\"\nThe teacher then starts to put some sand   into the bottle. For the third time, the teacher asks, \"Is it full?\"\nNow most students give no answer, but some still answer, \"Yes!\"\nThen the teacher pours   a cup of water into the bottle. \"What does it tell us?\" asks the teacher.\nOne clever student answer, \"No matter   how busy you are, you can always find time to do some more things.\"\n\"No,\" says the teacher. \"If you don't put the big stones into the bottle first, you can never get _ in. The big stones are the important things in your life. If you fill your life with small things like the small stones, sand and water, you'll never have the time for the important things.\"", "id": "middle3861.txt"}
