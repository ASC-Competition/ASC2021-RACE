So I pick on my baby sister because I love her.\"\nLauren --- age 4\n\"I know my elder sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new clothes.\"\nElaine --- age 5\n\"Love is when Mummy gives Daddy the best piece of chicken.\"\nClear --- age 5\n\"My Mummy loves me more than anybody. You don't see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night.\"\nJessica --- age 8\n\"You really shouldn't say 'I love you' unless you mean it. But if you mean it, you should say it a lot.
