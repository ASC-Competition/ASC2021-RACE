On their faces was confidence .\nThey knew the exam would be easy. The professor (a teacher at a college) had said they could bring any books or notes during the test.\nRight after they came into the classroom. The professor handed out the papers.

Two?\" The students moved restlessly in their seats. \"One, then? Certainly somebody has finished one.\" But the class kept silent. The professor said, \"That is exactly what I expected. I just want to make you know clearly that even though you have completed four years of engineering. There are still many things about the subject you don't know.
