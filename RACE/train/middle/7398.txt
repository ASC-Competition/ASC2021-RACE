Let me tell you the way to my house. Take a taxi from the airport. You pass a bank on your right and then go along Long Street. You go through Six Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and Eighth Avenue. When you see a big supermarket, turn left. Then go down Bridge Street and turn left at New Park. Go along Centre Street and my house is on your right.\nI hope you can have a good trip.\nYours,\nMike", "id": "middle7398.txt"}
