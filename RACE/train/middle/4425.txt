As artist grows older his picture may alter , but not very much. But Picasso, the great Spanish painter, was like a man who had not yet found his own particular style of painting. He kept on struggling  to find the perfect expression till his death in 1973.\nSome of Picasso's paintings are rich, soft colored and beautiful. Others are ugly and cruel and strange. But such paintings allow us to imagine things for ourselves. They force us to say to ourselves, \"What does he see that makes him paint like that?\" And we begin to look beneath the surface of the things we see.\nPicasso painted thousands of pictures in different styles. Sometimes he painted the natural look of things. _ He showed us what the mind knows as well as what the eye sees. At the age of 90 he remained as _ about the world as he had been when he was young. That is why people have called him \"the youngest painter in the world\".", "id": "middle4425.txt"}
