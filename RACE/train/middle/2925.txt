Suddenly, a warning of a strong storm was announced ,so all rushed to their boats. Yet, Love did not wish to run away quickly. There was so much to do. But as the clouds darkened, Love realized it was time to leave. But there were no boats to spare. Love looked around with hope.\nJust then Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love shouted, \"Richness, can you take me with you?\" Richness answered, \"No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.\"\nLove decided to ask Vanity  who was also passing by in a beautiful boat for help, But Vanity said with a cold voice, \"No, I can't take you with me. My boat will get dirty with your mummy feet.\"\nSorrow passed by after some time. Again, Love asked for help. But it was useless. \"No, I can't take you with me. I am so sad. I want to be by myself.\"\nWhen Happiness passed by a few minutes later, Love again called for help. But Happiness was so happy that it hardly concerned about anyone else.\nLove was growing restless and hopeless. Just then somebody called out, \"Come, Love, I will take you with me.\" Love did not know who was being so kind, but jumped onto the boat happily.\nAfter getting off the boat, Love met Knowledge. Love asked, \"Knowledge, do you know who was so kind to give me a lift when no one else wished to help?\"\nKnowledge smiled, \"Oh, that was Time,\"\n\"Time?\" asked Love. \"But why did Time help me?\" Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, \"Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.\"", "id": "middle2925.txt"}
