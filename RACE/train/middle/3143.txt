Knowing what to do during a fire can save yourself. It is important to know the ways you can use and to show them to everyone in the family, such as stairways   and fire escapes, but not lifts .\nFrom the lower floors of the building, escaping through windows is possible, learn the best way of leaving through windows with the least chance of serious injury  .\nThe second floor windows are usually not very high from the ground. An average   person, hanging by the finger-tips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground. It is about the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way than to stay in a burning building.\nWindows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, or smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked   into the room.\nOn a second or third floor, the best windows for escaping are those which open onto a roof . From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely, dropping onto stones might end in injury.", "id": "middle3143.txt"}
