You Google it. You're arguing with a friend about who played Mickey in The Goonies. You solve the problem by Googling it. You don't know the way to that new restaurant. You Google Maps it.\nWe hold the answers to about all of life's questions in our hands today. But that means our brains are feeling free to take some rest. According to the Daily Mail, our growing reliance on  the Internet for fact checking is making our memories worse.\nScientists at Harvard University found people now regard Google and other search engines as an outside part of their own brains, rather than a tool. Writing in the Journal Scientific American, Harvard psychologists Daniel Wegner and Adrian Ward warn that people who believe their memorable facts that are saved online are much worse at remembering them.\n\"The Internet is also unlike a human memory partner; it knows more and can produce the information more quickly, You can find almost all information today easily through a quick Internet search. It may be that the Internet is taking the place of people's memory.\"\nIn a series of tests, researchers found it was easy for people to remember information well if they believed it would be deleted.\nThose who thought it was stored on a computer were more forgetful, even if they were asked to keep the information in mind.", "id": "middle4781.txt"}
