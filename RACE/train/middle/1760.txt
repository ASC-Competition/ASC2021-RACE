I've learned some spoken language,but Thai writing is very difficult.The cooking lesson is my favourite.I'm learning all about Thai food and culture People don't use chopsticks here,but spoons and forks.When I come back,I'm going to cook you a real Thai meal.\nLast weekend we visited some temples.We also drove to Pattaya beach near Bangkok.I  thought it was great,but Sanan and Chinda say that next month they're taking me to Phuket  Island,where the beaches are even more beautiful.The month after next,we're going to travel  to Mr.Phairat,s hometown in the north of Thailand.The Phairats own land there,and they  have two elephants.I'm going to ride those elephants -- and even wash them.Sanan and  Chinda say it's really fun.\nI'm amazed by everything in this country,especially by the elephants.Elephants are an  important pan of Thai culture and way of life.They have been a traditional symbol of  Thailand for many years in times of war and peace.In the seventh century,a Thai king trained 20,000 elephants for battle.\nI'll tell you all about my Thai boxing lessons next time I write.\nLove,\nMandy", "id": "middle1760.txt"}
