She only has a daughter named Sandra. Mr. Black died twelve years ago. Mrs. Black was very sad and lived in her house alone. Two years ago her daughter had a baby. The young woman was busy all the time and had no time to look after her son James. She asked her mother to live with them.\nThe old woman had to sell her house and moved there. She was strong and could do all the housework. And the family liked her.\nLast autumn Mrs. Black went to do some shopping. A car hit her and her leg was hurt. She had to be in hospital for three months. She couldn't do anything after she came back. At first her daughter was kind to her, but soon she began to be tired of   her. The old woman wanted to leave, but she had no money to buy a house and nobody could take care of her. She didn't know what to do.\nOne morning Mrs. Black broke a plate. It made her daughter angry. She told James to buy a wooden   plate for his grandma. That afternoon James came back with two wooden plates. She was surprised and asked, \"Why did you buy two plates, son?\"\n\"One is for grandma,\" answered the boy, \"the other is for you! You will also have to use a wooden plate when you're old, I think.\"\nThe woman heard this and was sad. She cried for long. Now she is kind to her mother as she was before.", "id": "middle3255.txt"}
