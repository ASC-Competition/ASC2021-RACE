Little Tom came back home, with tears in his eyes.\n\"What's the matter, Tom? How's your trip?\" his mother asked with a big smile. \"I failed. The mountain is so high and full of big or small stones on the way, I still go ahead. But I was tired and it was so late that I had to come back.\" Tom cried. \"It doesn't matter, you are only 14 years old after all. You will have another chance.\" his mother said. \"But, standing at the top of the mountain is my dream!\" Tom said. His father came over and asked, \"Did you see the green trees on your way to the mountain?\" \"Sure, and there are a lot of beautiful flowers by the side of the road.\" Tom replied. \"Did you hear the birds singing?\" his father asked. \"There were many kinds of birds singing in the trees, and the sound was very sweet.\" Tom said. \"Did you feel the beauty of nature?\" his father asked. \"Yes, the blue sky, the white clouds, the green trees and the colorful flowers made a nice picture.\" Tom answered. \"That's enough!\" his father smiled and said, \"Please remember, son. For often, achieving what you expect is not the most important thing. Although you didn't reach the top of the mountain, you got a lot on the way.\"\nIt is true that not every goal will be achieved, not every job will end up with a success, and not every dream will come true. The most beautiful scenery   is on the way.\n,A, B, C, D,,. (5;2,10)", "id": "middle5371.txt"}
