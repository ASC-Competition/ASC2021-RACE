To my surprise, this meeting lasted for four hours! It told us in detail how to be a good volunteer at hospital.\nFor example, Graham, the director, told us to keep eye contact while offering help and never wait to be asked but offer help first. She also told us to bend down  to listen while patients are talking to show that we're willing to hear. We should lead them to ask others for help if we can't answer their questions and never say: it is not my business.\nFor the whole meeting, Miss Graham taught us how to satisfy patients through our words, body language and manners. It impressed me a lot. Americans pay so much attention to serving people with a professional attitude .\nI suddenly realized why many people feel foreigners are really nice and friendly. They have been trained to do so since they were young. They always ask themselves: How do people feel toward my service? How can I improve to let them feel better? I really like this kind of culture.", "id": "middle6321.txt"}
