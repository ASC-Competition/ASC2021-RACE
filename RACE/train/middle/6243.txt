Sure, the rosy flesh   quenches your thirst  . But now there are more reasons than ever for people to reach for a slice of watermelon.\nMeet Dr Alison Edwards. She is a scientist at the Agricultural Research Service. Scientists are people who come up with new ideas called theories  . They usually do scientific research to test their new theories. That's how they find out if a new idea is a good one, or if the new idea will bring an even better idea.\nAt her lab, Dr Edwards recently learned more about the secrets of why watermelons are good for you!\nDr Edwards has known for a long time that watermelons have vitamin C. But recently she learned that watermelons also have lycopene  . It is something that gives tomatoes and watermelons their rosy red colour.\nWhat's so special about the lycopene in watermelons?\nDr Edwards says that watermelons and tomatoes both have lots of lycopene.

In fact, the lycopene from tomatoes is more easily absorbed   inside your body once they have been cooked.", "id": "middle6243.txt"}
