Ice cream men usually drove their trucks to primary schools. I had never thought one ice cream truck would come to bring ice cream to us older kids. When I went up to the truck, I was quite surprised to hear the man call out, \"Free ice cream!\" To make sure of his words, I asked, \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" \"Free ice cream. Choose whichever you like.\" he said, smiling.\nAfter I was certain that the man was just giving away the ice cream, I talked with him for a long time. He told me that his dream had always been to travel around giving away ice cream, and that's what he was now doing. With his mother's support, he kept doing what he loved even during hard times. Now, however, some large companies are helping him his plan.\nThe man said he wanted to encourage people to do exactly what their heart told them to do with their lives. I kept asking him, \"So your dream was just to drive around and give away ice cream? It seems like a very unusual goal.\" \"Yes, just meeting people and making them smile,\" he replied. At that point he handed me my ice cream. I thanked him, but what I got from him was much more than just an ice cream. It can't easily be explained in words. I believe what he is doing is exactly what a great person does all the time: small acts of big love.", "id": "middle3788.txt"}
