The Hall of Supreme Harmony is where the emperor   [:]watched birthday celebrations and coronation   ceremonies from his Dragon Throne . And then there are the Imperial Gardens, where you can walk along the paths and pavilions, admiring the beautiful rock arrangements, flowers and cypress trees.\nWhile we loved our visit to the Forbidden City, we only wish we had more time to see everything. But then again, I'm not sure there could ever be enough time to fully enjoy all of the art and history in this wonderful place.", "id": "middle7227.txt"}
