She refuses to believe everything that she reads. \"Not everything in books is true,\" she said.\nMany other students in her school think the same thing as Li. They learned this through finding a mistake in their Chinese textbook. They learned a Tang poem, Ci Beigu Shanxia, last year. There was a picture that showed a boat in full sail on a river. \"But according to the famous line from the poem, feng zheng yifan xuan, the sail shouldn't be spread ,\" said Zhang Jiayi, Li's classmate.\nTo get the right answer, the students turned to their Chinese teacher, Liu Yan. Liu and the students looked up books, searched on the Internet and made sure that the People's Education Press had really made a mistake about the picture.\nThe students wrote a letter to them about the mistake. \"I think my students did a right thing but I never expected a reply,\" said Liu. \"I took it as a way of letting them know the importance of spirit of questioning.\"\nTo their surprise, one month later, they got the reply from Gu Zhenbiao, the expert of Chinese textbooks in middle schools. Gu said sorry for the mistake and he also said he really thinks the students are very great.\nWhen Liu read the letter loudly to all the students, everyone was excited. \"We are very happy we have our own ideas!\" said Li.", "id": "middle4323.txt"}
