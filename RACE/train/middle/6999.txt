I moved to the small, busy town of Edison in New Jersey six years ago. It was during the second term of my fifth grade. My parents got new jobs and higher income, so they decided it was time to move from Woodbridge to a better, more educational town.\nIn the US, it is unnecessary to take a test to get into a \"good\" middle or high school. You just attend the school close to where you live. So, many parents will think about the quality (,) of the local school when they decide to buy a new house. My parents did the same. We finally chose Edison mainly because of the high quality of its school.\nIn New Jersey, an area with a good school usually means _ Asian people. There are about 300 students in our school. 55% are Asians and just under half of that are Chinese. There are so many Chinese people nearby that we even have our own Chinese school.\nEdison is an old town, just like thousands of others in the United States. However, I have treated it as my hometown. That's where I spend much of my youth, and the memories there can't be moved at all.", "id": "middle6999.txt"}
