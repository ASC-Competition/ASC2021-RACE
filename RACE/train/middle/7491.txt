How are you these days?\nSimon: Not bad. But I just feel a little sad.\nDaniel: What's wrong?\nSimon: You see, I bought some goldfish last week. But now they all die.\nDaniel: I'm afraid you forgot to change water for them.\nSimon: No.  I just gave them a lot to eat. I think they like eating.\nDaniel: Oh,I see. It's the food that killed your goldfish. You know goldfish can only remember things for 3 seconds.\nSimon: So what?\nDaniel: So they always forget they have already eaten food. They just keep eating if you feed them.\nSimon: You mean my goldfish die of eating too much?\nDaniel: That's right.\nSimon: Oh,my poor goldfish.\nDaniel: Don't be sad. Why not have a cat or a dog as your pet?\nSimon: Oh, no. I don't like them. Cats and dogs always make much noise and they will make my room dirty. Besides that I should take good care of them.\nDaniel: Well,why don't you try an e-pet?  It's modern and cute. And it's easy to look after because they don't need food and water. The most important thing is that you can control it freely.\nSimon: That's good! I want to have an e-pet.\nDaniel: That will cost you a lot of money.\nSimon: Oh, my God! I think I will just have it in my dream.", "id": "middle7491.txt"}
