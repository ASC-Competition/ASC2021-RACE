I joined a club called \"passing help\" last month. Now let me tell you why I joined it.\nOne evening this May, on my way home my old car broke down .It was 25 miles from my home. I wanted to get a ride , but there was no car. It was also hard to take a taxi. I decided to take a bus home .I went to a bus stop nearby. After a while, a bus came, but it did not go to my town , the bus driver was a young woman. She was kind and she told me which bus I should take. I waited there for about thirty minutes,but no bus came .At last a car came to me and a woman came out of the car .She was just the bus driver.  \"When I reached the bus station,I got to know that the bus to your town couldn't  come ,so I returned here .I just can't leave you here ,\"she said , \" Get in my car and I will take you back to your home.\"\n\"It is a long way.\" I said.\n\"Come on,sir, \"she said,\"Let's go.\"\nOn the way,she told me a story. A few days ago,there wasn't gas in her car. An old man drove her up to a gas station and then back to her car.\nWhen we got to my home,I wanted to give her some money to thank her,but she didn't accept her. \"I only want to help others and do something nice for somebody. Pass it along. \" she said.", "id": "middle4361.txt"}
