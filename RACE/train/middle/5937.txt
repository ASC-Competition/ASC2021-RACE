Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars .\nBut how to make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these:\na) Each nest must have six boards  . Don't make the boards too slippery  .\nb) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \"door\". The \"door\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily.\nc) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest.\nd) One piece of the board should be easy to open.\ne) Don't forget to color the nest.", "id": "middle5937.txt"}
