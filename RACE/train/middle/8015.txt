He was more interested in sport,especially kung fu,and hanging out with his street-gang friends. In 1959,Lee got into trouble with the police for fighting.His mother,fearing he would end up in prison,sent him to the USA. Two years later,he began studying at university there.\nWhile still a student,Lee opened his own kung fu school,teaching a new fighting style he had developed.What made Lee's style different was that it used power,strength and,quick--action attacks.It also combined Japanese,Korean and South American fighting styles with traditional stow--moving Chinese kung fu.\nAmong Lee's students were several famous actors who,impressed by his good--looks and fighting skill,encouraged him to start acting.Over the next fire years Lee achieved some Success in America.But his dream of introducing his fighting style into American movies was not accepted by local film makers who thought western audiences were not interested in kung fu.\nDetermined to prove them wrong,Lee returned to Hong Kong in 1970.There he made two films\n(1971)and\n(1972),using his kung fu ideas and techniques.The movies were huge hits world--wide,making Lee an international star and symbol of kung fu.These were followed by what is widely considered the greatest kung fu movie of all time,\n(1973).Tragically however,Lee suddenly and mysteriously died while making his next movie\n. He was only 33 years old.", "id": "middle8015.txt"}
