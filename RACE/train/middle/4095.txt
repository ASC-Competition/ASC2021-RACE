Every time I want to do really well in tests, I carry my lucky penny.\" Nick thought for a moment, and answered, \"My blue socks.\" \"Blue socks?\" the boys were surprised and asked together. Nick said that every time he wore his blue socks to school before a test, he got a good mark.\nThe next day Nick would have a Chinese test. He was sad because he couldn't find his blue socks to wear to school. \"Mom!\" shouted Nick. \"Where are my blue socks? I will have a Chinese test, and I need to wear them.\" \"Don't be silly,\" Nick's mom said. \"They need to be washed.\" \"When I wear them, I get a good grade,\" Nick said. \"Did you prepare for your test?\" asked Mom. \"Yes.\" \"Then don't worry about it. Just do your best,\" Mom encouraged. Nick was worried about his test because his lucky socks would not help him.\nA few days later, Nick's teacher told him that he got 95 in his test. Nick was so excited that he couldn't wait to tell Mom how well he did in his test. Mom said, \"It wasn't the blue socks that made you successful. It was made by yourself.\"", "id": "middle4095.txt"}
