He stayed there for several months and then came home again. Some of his friends visited him a few days after he got back. \"I had a very dangerous trip while I was in Russia,\" Jack said to them. \"I wanted to see a friend of mine in the country and the bad weather made me very late. So I was still traveling through a forest in a sleigh  when the sun went down. It was a long way from my friend's house when about twenty wolves began to follow my sleigh. It was very dark in the forest. There was thick snow on the ground. It was cold, and there were no houses for miles and miles. First I heard the wolves. The noise was terrible! The horses heard them, too. They were frightened and began running faster. Then I saw long, gray forms among the trees, and soon the wolves were near us. They were running very fast, and they didn't seem to get tired like the horses.\"\n\"What did you do?\" one of Jack's friends asked.\n\"When the wolves got very near,\" Jack answered, \"I put up my gun and shot the first wolf. The sleigh was moving about, but I hit the animal and killed it. Then all the other wolves stopped and ate it, so our sleigh got away from them for a few minutes.\"\n\"Then they finished their meal, and I heard them coming again. The moon was shining brightly on the snow now, and after a few minutes I saw them running among the trees once more. They came nearer again, and then I shot another of them, and the others stopped once more to eat it.\"\n\"The same thing happened again and again, and my horses became more and more tired and ran slower and slower until, after about two hours, only one wolf was still alive and following us.\"\n\"Wasn't it too fat to run?\" one of his friends asked.", "id": "middle6245.txt"}
