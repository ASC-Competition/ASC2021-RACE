There is some advice on studying and preparing for exams.\nSciences\nAsk students what is the most difficult course, and most of them will give you the same answer: mathematics. This is also true for Dai Shuang, a 14-year-old student at No.1 Middle School. He says, \"It's so difficult that I get a headache whenever I think about the math exam.\"\nAccording to Dai, studying this course is not easy. He usually studies math by himself and spends most of his free time reading math books and doing exercises.\n _ \nQin Xia, a math teacher, offers some advice. \"Most students fear mathematics because they think the class is too difficult or boring.\" he says, \"These students don't listen carefully in classes or even sleep.\" In Qin's opinion, they can try to take notes. And they'd better ask teachers for help. It's difficult for students to teach themselves math, which will waste a lot of time. Besides, doing a lot of exercises is also important.\nArts\nZhu Tianjiao, a 13-year-old student at Megan Middle School, is very nervous because she doesn't know how to improve her English.\n _ \nXia Bingcong, a top student at Tsinghua University shares  some of her learning experiences. According to Xia, memorizing, listening and reading are important in language learning. \"Studying on a daily basis  is the best choice.\" Xia says.", "id": "middle3685.txt"}
