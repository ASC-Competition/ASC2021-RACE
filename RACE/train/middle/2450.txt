Today I am going to tell you something about manners in different countries. I think you already know that people in different countries usually have different ways of doing things. Something that is rude in one country may be quite polite in another. For example, in Britain you mustn't lift your bowl to your mouth when you are having liquid food. That is considered bad manners in Britain. But in Japan you needn't worry about making a noise when you drink something. It shows that you are enjoying it. In Britain we try not to put our hands on the table at all during a meal. In Mexico, however, guests are expected to keep their hands on the table _ a meal. In Arabic countries we must be careful with our hands. You see, in Arabic countries you mustn't eat with your left hand. This is considered to be very impolite. So, what should you do if you visit a foreign country? Well, you needn't worry. You can ask the native people there to help you and you can just watch carefully and try to do what they do.", "id": "middle2450.txt"}
