Now Marie's son is taking care of the business, and he makes pies as good as his mother's. I enjoy my stay there as before. My family also like the pies. We feel relaxed while staying there.\n***\nOlive: I went to Pie Corner once. Their pies were great, too. But I feel more comfortable at Pie House. I am used to the taste there, which makes me feel happy. I'm really a fan of Pie House.\n***\nNed: Uncle Roy used to work for my mom. Later he opened Pie Corner on the next block after he got married. At the beginning, it's not easy for him, but it is becoming more and more popular especially among young people. They think Pie Corner can often give them a surprise.\n***\nMarie: Roy was already quite _ when working with me. I mean he had different, sometimes even strange, ideas about pies. There were times I thought his pies wouldn't taste good, but they turned out magically delicious. He is really creative and can always make new pies, which attract many people.\n***\nLee:  Ned has done quite well with Pie House. His pies make you feel warm. But if you want to try something interesting, you should go to Pie Corner.\n***\nChuck: The two pie shops are really different from each other. If eating Roy's pies is like taking an exciting trip, then Ned's pies are just like a sweet home you go back to after a long trip. Which one to go to depends on what you like.", "id": "middle2890.txt"}
