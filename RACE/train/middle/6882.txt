She waited for this moment for more than a year.\nMost of the kids in the first grade lost not only one tooth, but several. But my daughter kept waiting impatiently. Then, she finally got a loose   tooth. I never saw her so happy -- except on Christmas, Children's Day or her birthday. Last Friday night, she was eating an apple, and the tooth started to become loose. Minutes later, my daughter shouted happily. The tooth was out!\nI cleaned it off and put it under her pillow  . When she went to bed that night, my daughter wondered, \"Will the tooth fairy   let me keep the tooth?\" I told her _ might and _ 'd have to wait and see.\nThe tooth fairy comes from an old story. It's believed that when a kid loses his first tooth and puts it under his pillow, the tooth fairy will come to visit him when he is sleeping. If the tooth fairy sees the kid and loves him, she will leave some money under his pillow without taking away the tooth. If she doesn't think the kid lovely enough, she will still leave some money but take the tooth away.\nAnd then I put a dollar in my bag so that I'd remember to put it under my daughter's pillow. However, I forgot. Luckily, her dear dad remembered.", "id": "middle6882.txt"}
