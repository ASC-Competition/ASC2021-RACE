They held a basketball match to help 150 poor students in western China with school supplies  and winter clothes. She also worked with an organization in the US to raise money for children with heart disease.\nBorn in Guangdong Province in 1942, Liang moved with her family to Taiwan at the age of seven. Liang taught at a primary school for seven years until her boyfriend went to America in 1969, one year after they got married.\n\"We didn't have much money,\" she says, \" so I started babysitting for other Chinese families and taking care of my own daughter at the same time.\" She also taught children Chinese at Chinese schools. What's more, she would help newly arrived Chinese families find apartments and work, and sometimes lend them money.\n\"I remember those students from China who first came in 1986. They didn't have much money, and idea of what to do,\" Liang told us. \" I then asked people in my neighborhood and my Chinese friends for donations -not only some money but also small electronic appliances needed for daily living.\"\nOne of her experiences in Dayton, Ohio made her want to make volunteering a vocation . She remembers how she once collected  two Chinese professors who had missed their flight and had no one there to pick them up. A friend told Liang about it, and she went to meet them herself around midnight. She found the men feeling lost in that strange country, where no one spoke their language. They didn't want to go to an American hotel, and didn't know how they would get to Columbus the next day. \" So I talk to them and took them home with me,\" she says, \" and today, I am still in touch with those two professors. We are good friends.\"", "id": "middle6490.txt"}
