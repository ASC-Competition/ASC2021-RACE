You know that I love to cook. Everyone says that I am the next \"celebrity chef\". I never miss favourite cookery shows on TV. I always like to try new recipes. Curry is one of my favourite meals. I love all the spices and that is the problem!\nI am in the kitchen when the telephone rings. I answer the phone and chat for five minutes to my friend Kate. I go back to my curry, but I don't remember that the spices are already in and I add more. My curry smells delicious, but when we eat it everyone looks at me. The curry tastes very bad. My mum says, \"Why is it so hot?\"\nThen I remember about the spices.\nI'm off for a hamburger.\nLove,\nMike", "id": "middle6695.txt"}
