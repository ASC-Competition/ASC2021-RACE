They were then told to carry this bag with them everywhere they went for a week. They would put it inside their quilts at night, on the seats when sitting in a car or on a bus, and next to their desks at school. The days carrying the bag around with them made students get to know what a weight they were carrying in their minds. They had to pay attention to it all the time so that they wouldn't forget it. As time passed by, the potatoes went bad and smelt nasty . They all tried to get rid of them.\nToo often we think of tolerance  as a gift to other people, and clearly it is for ourselves!  If we choose to keep our sadness and hatred in our hearts, we will have to carry them around all our lives.\nDo you think you have got anything from the wise teacher and what she asked her students to do?", "id": "middle3890.txt"}
