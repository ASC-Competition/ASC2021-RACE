In a new programme \"Colour me Healthy\", Verity looks at the ways that colours can influence how hard we work and the choices we make. They can even change our emotions and even influence how healthy we are.\n\"Have you ever noticed how people always use the same colours for the same things?\" says Verity. \"Our toothpaste is always white or blue or maybe red. It's never green. Why not? For some reason we think that blue and white is clean, while we think of green products as being a bit unpleasant. It's the same for businesses. We respect a company which writes its name in blue or black, but we don't respect one that uses pink or orange. People who design new products can use these ideas to influence what we buy.\"\nDuring the programme, Verity studies eight different colours, two colours in each part. She meets people who work in the colour industry, from people who design food packages, to people who name the colours of lipsticks. Some of the people she meets clearly have very little scientific knowledge to prove their ideas, such as the American \"Colour Doctor\" who believes that serious diseases can be treated successfully by the use of coloured lights. However, she also interviews real scientists who are studying the effects of green and red lights on mice, with some surprising results.\nOverall, it's an interesting show, and anyone who watches it will probably find out something new. But because Verity _ to be polite to everyone she meets on the programme, it's up to you to make your own decisions about how much you should believe.", "id": "middle403.txt"}
