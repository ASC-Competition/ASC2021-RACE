He has just one line and you're the only one who fits his clothes!\" One afternoon, the school drama director suddenly shouted to me. She seemed so nervous and worried that I felt sorry for her and said, \"Ok\".\n\"You will be fine. It's easy!\" She said. But it wasn't easy at all. On the stage, four other actors and actresses spoke their lines, and I opened my mouth. Nothing came out. I couldn't even breathe. I just wanted to leave. The next thing I knew, I was running off the stage.\nAs I was running off the stage, I accidentally knocked over a glass of grape juice that was on a table. The purple juice hit the girl next to me --- Andrea, the leading actress of the drama. She gave me a nasty look. I thought she was going to kill me!\nBut then, Andrea quickly said, \"Darling, you're so silly! Let's toast  to my darling's silliness! Cheers!\" She grabbed another glass of grape juice and drank it. The other actor quickly followed Andrea's lead and saved the scene. The audience thought my mistake was part of the play!\nI apologized to everyone after the play. To my surprise, they were not angry with me. They told me, \"It's all a part of being on stage.\" I could be wrong, but I think I liked being on stage. I think I will try again.", "id": "middle5014.txt"}
