After an hour he could take a break for a while. Then he climbed up on the walls along the side of the farm. He could see a house with gold windows. \"If they could afford gold windows, then there must be other nice things inside the house.\" He imagined how great it would be to live there. Then he promised himself, \"Some day I will go there and see this wonderful place.\"\nOne morning, his father would go to the town and told him to stay at home for a rest. Knowing that this was his chance, he took a sandwich and went across the field towards the house with the gold windows.\nAs the afternoon went on, he began to realize how wrong he was. The house was much farther than he had expected. As he went near the house, he saw no gold windows but instead a place in need of painting. A small girl very close to his age came out of the poor house and stood there. He asked her if she had seen the house with the gold windows.\nThe girl said, \"Sure, I know.\" and invited him to sit on the porch  . As he sat there, he looked back from where he just came. There he saw the sunset   turned the windows of his house to gold! Now he understood that everyone had his own house with gold windows.", "id": "middle7275.txt"}
