On his way he met his friend, the old owl .  The owl greeted him, \"Good morning, my dear friend. Where are you going?\"  \"I'm going to the forest to look for some birds to eat.\" The cat answered. \"But be careful not to catch any of my children.\" The owl said to the cat. \"OK,\" the cat said. \"But what do your children look like?\" \"Oh,\" the owl said, \"they are the most beautiful birds in the forest.\"\n\"All right, I know that.\" The cat said and walked on to the forest.\nThe cat entered the forest and saw many beautiful birds here and there. He remembered what the owl had told him and went away. Then after a long time, he saw some ugly birds in a nest. He sat down and ate them one by one. When the owl came back to her nest, she found it was empty.", "id": "middle1093.txt"}
