He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work. One day he was walking along the shore. As he looked down at the beach, he saw something moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the thought that someone would dance on the beach. So he began to walk faster to catch up.As he got close,he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing,instead he was reaching down to the shore,picking up something and very gently and throwing it into the ocean. As he got closer he called out,\"Good morning!What are you doing?''\nThe young man paused ,looked up and replied,\"Throwing starfishes into the ocean.\"\n\"I guess I should have asked ,why are you throwing starfishes into the ocean?\"\n\"The sun is up and the tide is going out.And if I don't throw them in, they will die.\"\n\"But ,young man ,don't you realize that there are miles of beach and starfishes all along it. You can't possibly make a difference!\"\n\"The young man listened politely.Then he bent down ,picked another starfish and threw it into the sea ,and said ,It made a difference for that one.\"\nThe wise man was lost in thought when the young man kept trying. Yes, there is something very special in every one of us. We have all been gifted with the ability to make a difference. And if we can know that gift, we will gain the power to shape the future.Each of us can do something for the future,each of us must find our starfish. And if we throw our starfishes wisely and well,the world will be better.", "id": "middle4270.txt"}
