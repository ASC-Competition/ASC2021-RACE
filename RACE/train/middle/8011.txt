The children can have a school dinner-a hot, cooked meal; or they can take a packed  lunch with them, which usually includes cold food like sandwiches.\nOften parents know what their children want. Cath, a mother of three children, told us, \"My children have packed lunches because they say they don't like to have school dinners. So I make three packed lunches every morning.\"\nHowever, another mother, Susan, made a different choice. She said, \"My daughters have a always had school dinners. I think they probably get healthier food at school than a few sandwiches I make for them.\"\nBut how healthy are school dinners? Kaz, a father, thought poorly of them. He said, \"Fizzy  drinks were offered and I think there were a lot of chips.\"\nJamie Oliver spent a year working in a school kitchen. He was worried about the unhealthy food which included burgers, pizzas and chips. So he tried to cook healthy food such as good stews and curries for the children instead.\nSo Jamie improved the school dinners, and trained the dinner ladies to cook healthy food in that school. Then he advised the government to improve school food across the country. And it seems that the changes have begun.\nAnna, a pupil, told us, \"We used to have a fast food window where you got chips and coke, but they stopped that this year. There's a salad restaurant, which is good, so it's healthier than it was.\"\n,.", "id": "middle8011.txt"}
