The year 2012 saw 6,950 towns and cities in more than 152 countries took part in Earth Hour movement. Last year 7,000 towns and cities in more than 154 countries took part in Earth Hour. This year, WWF is calling for people across the world to take part in Earth Hour 2014 - the biggest switch-off in history.\nFor the eighth year, people are being asked to turn off their lights for one hour to call attention to the issue of climate change. The WWF's organizers say climate change is one of the greatest threats  facing wildlife and nature. They also say when it comes to save energy and money, big changes start with small steps like turning out the lights.\nEarth Hour supporter Jamie Oliver has some great ideas of his own for helping the environment: \"We can all make simple changes to help, like always choosinghigher-welfare  meat, and even trying to have a couple of meat-free days a week. More little steps, such as taking a shower instead of a bath, leaving the car behind and walking to work, not leaving electrical appliances on standby  and so on are the beginning of a low carbon lifestyle and a healthier world.\nThis year, Earth Hour is asking people to take the movement \"beyond the hour\". Earth Hour is a call to stand up and get involved. We hope everyone will join us in turning off for a brighter future.", "id": "middle3230.txt"}
