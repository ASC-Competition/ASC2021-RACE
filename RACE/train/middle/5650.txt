He liked helping others and people asked him for help when they were in trouble. He even got the name\"Happy Charlie\".\nOne day, a boy called Waterworks came to the town on holiday. No matter what Charlie said to him, Waterworks would always find some reason to be sad-- My parents didn't buy me that toy; I can't watch TV; I don't like to go to school...... Everything seemed so sad to Waterworks. He was always sad. But Charlie didn't care and kept spending more time with Waterworks , trying to make him happy.\nThen, one day, they went out together.
