The story said:\nWere you ever in a hospital when you were small? How did you feel? The doctors in Children's Hospital are asking for money for children's toys. Some children in the hospital must stay in bed for many weeks. Toys are needed to keep these sick children happy and quiet. Money for them can be sent to the hospital.\nAfter Mrs. Weeks read the story, she said,\"This story gave me an idea.\"\n\"You want us to bring some money for the toys.\"\"We could bring some of our own toys for the children in the hospital, \"said the boys and girls one after another.\n\"Well, your ideas would be nice, \"Mrs. Weeks said,\"but mine is different.\"\nMrs. Weeks smiled. \"Do you think you could make toys?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, yes,\" the whole class answered.\n\"Great! Let's begin to make toys tomorrow,\" said Mrs. Weeks.\nOn Saturday afternoon, Mrs. Weeks took the children to the hospital with the toys made by her students.\nThe children in the hospital felt very happy to see the toys. The children in the class felt happy, too. A few days later, Mrs. Weeks read another newspaper story to the class:\nSome school pupils brought toys to Children's Hospital last week. The toys were made by the pupils of Grade Three in Green Street School. The doctors said, \"We have never had so many wonderful toys. Our children are very happy with them. They say, 'THANK YOU, GRADE THREE'\"", "id": "middle2791.txt"}
