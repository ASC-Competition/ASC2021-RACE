They had been married   for more than 60 years. They kept no secrets from each other except that the old woman had a shoe box on the top of her closet . She told her husband never to open it or ask about it.\nFor all these years , he had never thought about the box, but one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would never get better.\nThe woman said it was time that he should know what was in the box. The old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife's bedside.\nWhen he opened it , he found two beautiful doilies  and some money. The money was over $25,000.\n\"When we got married,\" she said, \"my grandmother told me that the secret of a happy family was never to argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet  a doily.\"\nThe little old man was so moved. Only two doilies were in the box. She had only been angry with him twice in all those years.\n\"My dear,\" he said, \" but what about all this money?\" Where did it all come from?\"\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"that's the money I made from selling the doilies.\"", "id": "middle3593.txt"}
