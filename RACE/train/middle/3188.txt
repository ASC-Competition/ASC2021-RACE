They could climb up trees, grow flowers and even play badminton. They liked to watch the birds flying among the trees in the garden. They even started to put food out to attract more birds.\nEverything was fine for a few days until one afternoon there was a strange bumping noise on a window. Emily went outside and found a small bird dead on the grass. Its neck seemed to be broken.\n\"It must have flown into the window,\" Alex said when his sister Emily called him to have a look. \"Ah, yes, look here. You can see the mark where it hit the window. There are a couple of tiny feathers stuck  on the window.\"\n\"Poor thing!\" Emily said.\nDuring the next month, five more birds died in the same way. \"Why would they fly to the windows?\" they wondered. Finally they found out the truth. When the birds were flying, they couldn't see into the rooms. All they saw was the reflection  of the garden. They thought that they were flying into trees because they saw trees reflected by the window.\n\"Something has to be done to save the birds.\" the parents decided.\nAt first, he family tried keeping curtains across the windows, but this made the room dark. Then they bought some strong black paper and cut out the shape of a _ . They made six hawks - one for each window. They stuck the hawks to the windows. They looked pretty and did not keep out much light. When the birds saw the hawks, they would fly away.\nAfter that, there were no more dead birds. The family were much happier.", "id": "middle3188.txt"}
