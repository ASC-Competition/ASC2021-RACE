Technology is greatly affecting all ways of our lives, from the ways we work to the ways we play. And it even causes a number of social problems such as cloning   humans.\nWe have had lots of technology and it has changed our lives a lot. We are sure that humans will continue to use more and more technology. Here are some examples of modern technology that will change our ideas and will affect our lives greatly.\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS)  \nIt's a system that uses radio signals from satellites to show exact   information.   It tells you where the user is on the earth in all weather conditions.  It's made up of three parts: satellites, control equipments   on land and receivers.\nSpace Technology\nRussian and American scientists have worked together for the International Space Station, (ISS) for a long time. They hope the ISS will provide a long-lasting lab. Such a lab will bring humans limitless   advantages. It's even hoped that one day space technology will take humans to their new houses in space.\nUnderwater Robot\nHercules is a kind of underwater robot with some high technology equipments. It will be used to search for ancient ships which were destroyed into the deep sea during their journey long ago.\nThe world is changing so quickly that it's hard for us to catch up with all the new inventions because they seem to come out every month. It's important for us to learn about new technology and the role that it plays in our lives. So we should be willing to accept modem technology, or we will fall behind the times.", "id": "middle2230.txt"}
