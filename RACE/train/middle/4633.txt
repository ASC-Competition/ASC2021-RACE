We were just out for a picnic. When lunch time came, we decided to go and get something to eat, and meet back on the grass.\nSusan and I headed for a hot dog stand     . We watched the seller put together the hot dog. But when Susan took out her money, the man surprised us. \"It looks a little overdone,\" he said, \"so you don't have to pay me. \" We said our thanks,joined our friends, and began to enjoy our food. But as we talked and ate, I noticed a man sitting alone, in dirty clothes. I could tell that he hadn't had a bath for days. Another homeless person, I thought.\nWe finished eating but when Susan and I went to throw away the lunch bag, I heard a voice ask, \"there isn't any food in that bag, is there?\"\nIt was the homeless man. I didn't know what to say. \"No, I ate it already. \" \"Oh, really? \" was his only answer. He was obviously very hungry.\nI felt bad for him, but I didn't know what to do. Suddenly Susan said, \"I'll be right back. Please wait for me a minute. \" I watched curiously   as she went across to the hot dog stand. Then I realized what she was doing. She bought a hot dog, crossed back, and gave the man the food.\nWhen she came back to us, Susan said simply,  \"I was just passing on the kindness that someone gave to me. \"\nThat day I learned how _ can go farther than the person you give to.
