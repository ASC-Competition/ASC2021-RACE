He found many of the old medical books to be full of mistakes. So his wish was to write a new one.\nHe did his best to study medical science. He studied not only the herbs in his own garden, but also the wild ones. He set out many times on long journeys to collect herbs and talk with old farmers. He learned a lot from the working people.\nAfter many years of hard work and study, Li Shizhen finished his great work \"Ben Cao Gang Mu\" . At that time he was sixty. His book is now one of the greatest contributions of the Chinese people to the medical science of the world.", "id": "middle27.txt"}
