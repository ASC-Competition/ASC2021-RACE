At the front door of his building, he looked for his keys. He didn't have them. It was 3.30 p.m. and his parents worked until 6.00 p.m. Alain looked at his apartment on the eighth floor. He saw an open window. He closed his eyes and imagined   himself climbing the building. When he opened his eyes, he told himself,\"I can do it.\"Fifteen minutes later, he was in his house and his fear   of height was gone.\nToday Alain still climbs buildings. In 2003, he climbed a building in London dressed as Spiderman   to advertise the movie. In 2004, he climbed Taipei 101(one of the tallest buildings in the world).

If you have a dream----something you really want to do, it can become real. But you must be brave and keep trying. If something bad happens, don't give up. Close your eyes and tell yourself, \"I can do it.\"", "id": "middle5756.txt"}
