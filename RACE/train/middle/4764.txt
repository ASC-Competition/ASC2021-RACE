But maybe I can be famous someday! I can't sing or dance or act in movies, but I can do many other things. I can play three instruments: the guitar, the violin and the drums. I think I can be in the music club. Maybe I can be a famous musician. I like to read story books and I can write stories. Maybe I can be a famous writer. I like sports, too, but I don't think I can be a famous and successful sports man. Can I join you?\nLove\nXiao Ming", "id": "middle4764.txt"}
