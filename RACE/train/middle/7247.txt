I also think my work is very important. But there was a time when I thought I would never have a job like this.\nI wasn't the best student because I didn't do much schoolwork. Just before I left school, I started thinking what I might do and found that there's not much I could do. I thought I wasn't that kind of person to have a career.\nI then found myself a job, looking after two little girls for a family. It wasn't difficult at first. But problems began when I agreed to live in, so that my boss could go out to work in the evenings. I got very tired because I had too many late nights and early mornings with the children.\nOne Sunday, I was in the park with the children, and met Mary who used to go to school with me. I told her about my job. She said that I should get a qualification   if I wanted to work with children. And it would help me learn more skills to look after children better without feeling too tired. _ . I decided   to take part-time lessons. In that way, I had to leave the family. But all the lessons I took helped me look after children better and helped me get a job at a kindergarten  .\nNow I have a job as a professional teacher at a kindergarten. I should be thankful to Mary. I would never have a career if it wasn't for her.", "id": "middle7247.txt"}
