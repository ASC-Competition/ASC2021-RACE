Simple passwords are easy to be stolen.\nA password is like a key to your home. If someone steals it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to them until we lose or forget one.\nA study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16% took a first name as a password. Another 14% used the easiest keyboard combinations such as \"12345678\"or \"QWERTY\". 5% of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3% of the passwords expressed feelings like \"I don't care\", \"Whatever\", \"I love you\" or their opposite, \"I hate you\".\nRobert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter  and one symbol.\nOf course, safe passwords don't mean those hard to remember.
