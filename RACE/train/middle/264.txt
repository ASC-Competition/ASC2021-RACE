But there are deserts in many other places: in America, in Asia and in Australia. In 1917 the temperature in Death Valley, in the United States, was over 48degC every day for six weeks.

But one animal likes the desert -- the camel. It has big feet to walk on the sand. It can live for a long time without water. Sometimes it doesn't drink anything for weeks -- so it gets very thirsty! When it finds water it can drink 100 liters  at a time.", "id": "middle264.txt"}
