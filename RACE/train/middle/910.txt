The easiest solution is to keep a full set of toiletries   and make-ups stored somewhere at the office. A woman going to an evening party should dress in one of her \"basic dresses\" in the morning--the kind that can change into a different look with an added scarf or jewelry. In fifteen minutes, when her office day has ended, she can metamorphose  herself into another person with freshly cleaned teeth, combed hair, a new face, a different and dressier  pair of shoes, and some sparkling jewelry. If she must wear a long dress for the party, she should bring it to the office in a protective bag and store it safely until she has to put it on.", "id": "middle910.txt"}
