One day, the young mouse woke up from his sleep and looked out of the hole. As he looked out, a fantastic smell came to his nose. \"Cheese!\" the mouse said happily to himself. \"I'll go and get it now and have it for breakfast.\"\nBut then he remembered his parents' words. His parents were very clever mice and often said to their son, \"Always wait before you go for a piece of cheese.\"\nSo the young mouse waited quietly. Then he heard a quiet \"Miaow\" and he knew the cat was there. He stayed in the hole and said to himself, \"I'm glad I listened to my parents and learned to wait.\"\nThe next day, he looked out again. He put his nose out of the hole, and the beautiful smell of cheese came to his nose again. He could see the cheese. It was only a few centimetres away. But he sat still and waited quietly. This time he did not hear any cat's noise. Instead he heard a very quiet \"Woof, woof.\"\n\"It's a dog!\" he thought. \"If the dog is there, the cat won't be there. I expect the dog has chased the cat away, so I'm safe.\" The mouse ran out of the hole and started eating the cheese. He did not see the cat, which caught him and ate him.\nWhen the cat finished her meal, she said to herself, \"I'm glad I listened to my parents and learned a second language.\"", "id": "middle2194.txt"}
