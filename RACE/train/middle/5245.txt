They think pop-stars earn a lot of money, they lead interesting and exciting lives, thousands of fans love them, and they become famous!\nYes, but first they must become stars. Most performers star life with a group. This is the pattern nowadays. But there are many groups and competitions are hard. Groups appear and disappear almost overnight. Only a small number survive. Almost without exception they have to work very hard before they reach the top.\nAnd very few reach the top and stay there. In England there are perhaps thirty or so groups at the top. Most of these do not earn so much money, perhaps 500 pounds each time they perform. What's more, they have quite a lot of expenses . They have to pay a manager, for example. He is the key person in their lives and takes about 20% of their earnings-perhaps more. Then there are their clothes, their instruments and their van. Sometimes they are still playing for the last two items.\nAnd don't forget, they have to travel a great deal-sometimes 2,000 miles in one week. At times they even sleep in their van instead of a hotel, just to save money.\nSo now, what do you think? Are pop-stars so rich? And do they have such exciting lives?", "id": "middle5245.txt"}
