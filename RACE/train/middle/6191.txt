It is also the second largest lake in the world. It is an important lake because it is one of the sources  for the longest river in the world, the Nile River.Lake Victoria provides a source of water, food, and power for several African countries.Lake Victoria is a big part of African life.\nUnfortunately, Lake Victoria has a problem. _ .There are several power stations at Lake Victoria in Uganda. These are on the Nile River, and besides producing power, they keep the water of the lake at a certain level.For the past forty years, that level has been 11.9 meters.Over the last several years, the water level has dropped by about 2.5 meters.There seem to be several reasons for this drop.\nOne possible reason is drought .Drought has been very bad in the area since 2000.Lake Victoria gets all of its water from rain, so the drought means less water in the lake.\nHowever, some environmentalists believe that the real problem is the power plants(factories) on Lake Victoria. Uganda depends on those power plants for most of its power, and they made the power plants larger in 2000.Many people believe the power plants have been taking too much water off Lake Victoria. As a result, they have been asked to use less water until Lake Victoria goes back to its old level.\nWhether the low water level is caused by drought or power plants, the result is the same.This is already a poor area of Africa, where many people live a really hard life.People, animals and plants around Lake Victoria will suffer even more from low water levels on the lake.Many people need Lake Victoria for fishing or growing food. Fish need the water to live, and animals need it for water.Plants around the lake will die without the water, and then more animals and people will suffer.Unless the lake fills soon, many people will suffer and die.", "id": "middle6191.txt"}
