He was always happy and always had something interesting to say. If someone asked him how he was doing, he would reply, \"Couldn't be better!\" He was really a care-free young man and never felt tired.\nMike used to say, \"Each morning I wake up and say to myself, 'Mike, you have two choices  today. You can choose to be happy or you can choose to be upset.' I choose to be happy. Each time something happens, I am always ready to learn a good lesson. I choose to learn from life.\"\nI tried to understand what he said. Indeed life is all about choices. Every situation is a choice. The bottom line is: You're living your life and you make it either happy or sad.\nSeveral years later I had a car accident and my legs were seriously injured. When I was lying on the ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or choose to die. I chose to live.\nPeople like to say, \"Choose the one you love and love the one you choose.\" Why not choose the one we love and live happily?", "id": "middle3583.txt"}
