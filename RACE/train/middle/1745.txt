For example, a person who is very good at math can go to a famous college but also can be a good football player .\nThis experience made me think again that I must try to find where my own interests might lead me . To be honest, it was not easy . However, I never felt sorry to choose this way because it helped me understand myself . If I took the College Entrance Examination,as we call it gaokao in China, it could never possibly do .\nWhen I entered high school, I took gaokao seriously because it seemed to me a great way to show how good at my lessons . However,as I grew older, I realized gaokao did make me work hard at my lessons, but the pressure also pushed many other activities out of my life, like guitar--playing . Although I had no time for it, I will still get to it in the future .\nNo doubt, gaokao provides a way of choosing those who are successful in their studies . But it is really important for all of us to rethink what \" talent \" really is today . This is because we now live in a world in which all of our other human qualities ( )are needed for success, not just the high grade .\nKen Robinson once said, \" the society depends on different kinds of talents . \"  However, gaokao pays too attention  to a person's grades but little to his other qualities. And it is these qualities that makes life colorful and fun .\nAs high school students, we can not change the present situation of eduction, but we are always free to think outside of the box . Although good school grade is still useful, I hope one day we will see our education also welcomes the amazing possibilities in different people .", "id": "middle1745.txt"}
