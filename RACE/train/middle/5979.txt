For years, scientists said \"no.\" or \"we don't know.\" But today this is changing. Seth Shostak and Alexandra Barnett are astronomers . They believe intelligent life exists   somewhere in the universe. They also think we sill soon contact these beings(;).\nWhy do Shostak and Barnett think intelligent life exists on other planets? The first reason is time. Scientists believe the universe is about 12 billion years old. \"This is long enough for other planets to have intelligent life,\" say Shostak and Barnett. The second reason is size--the universe is huge. \"Tools like the Hubble Telescope  have shown that there are at least 100 billion galaxies,\" says Shostak. \"And our galaxy, the Milky Way, has at least 100 billion stars. Some planets going around these stars might be similar to Earth.\"\nIn the past, it was hard to look for signs of intelligent life in the universe. But now, powerful telescopes  allow scientists to discover smaller planets--the size of Mars or Earth--in other solar systems. These planets might have intelligent life.\nHave beings from space already visited Earth? \"Probably not,\" says Shostak. \"It's a long way away. However, intelligent beings may contact us in other way, such as radio signals . In fact, they may be trying to communicate with us now, but we don't have the right tools to receive their messages. However, this is changing. By 2025, we could make contact with other life forms  in our universe and we might help each other.\"", "id": "middle5979.txt"}
