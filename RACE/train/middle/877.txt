How do so many people move on their way to work and school?\nIn New York you can travel by subways, bus, taxi and private   car. The subway runs on the railroad lines under the city. It crosses the city at different points and goes to all parts of the city. Travelling by subway is the fastest way to get around the city.\nThe second way to travel is by bus. It is a slower way to travel.\nYou can also travel by taxi. This is very expensive, but the taxi will take you to every place you want to go to. If traffic is heavy, the taxi will be slow. During the mornings and afternoons, there is the \"rush hour\". This is the time when the traffic is very heavy with people going to and from work..\nThe last way is to use your private car. It's not good to drive during the \"rush hour\". If there is an accident on the road, you will have to wait for a long time.\nThe best time to travel is from 9 a.m to 4.pm . Traffic will be less crowded during this time because most people are already at school or at work at that time.", "id": "middle877.txt"}
