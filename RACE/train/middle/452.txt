She did it her way.\nI got the call at work, and I headed home quickly. Mom and Dad lived on a small farm that they had owned since I was seven. I hated going there every weekend. There was nothing for a young girl to do but watch the one station on the old TV set, if the weather allowed reception .\nMy mom, on the other hand, loved the peace and quiet of the land and loved to work in the garden among her flowers and vegetables. The place was simple, with no indoor plumbing or heat. We had a big wood stove in the kitchen that did its best to heat the little farmhouse, but it always seemed cold and too quiet to me.\nIn the evenings, my mom and I would sit for hours singing in the little kitchen.

I sat there stunned, with a tear running down my cheek, as I listened to every familiar note.\nThen the radio announcer of this oldie station came on. \"Here's one we haven't heard in a while,\" and an unfamiliar song began. I began to cry harder as I heard the words sung over the airwaves. \"Come down, come down from your Ivory Tower...\".", "id": "middle452.txt"}
