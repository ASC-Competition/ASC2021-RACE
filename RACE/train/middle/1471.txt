She got 3600 yuan as gift money this Spring Festival. However, her grandmother took away all the money and put it in a bank account.\nMany students experienced the same thing as Chen. They got their gift money, only to immediately have it taken away.\nXiong Shengyue, 14, from Nanjing, doesn't agree with the practice. \"I think the money should be the children's, \" she said. \" We should take care of it by ourselves.\"\nIt is not that simple, said Chu Chaohui, a researcher at national Institute of Education Sciences.\nGiving gift money is used to show social status  and develop relationships, he told Beijing Legal Evening News. Gift money has lost its traditional meaning of good will and has \"little to do with the children\". What's more, children don't earn the money through work. So he thought that parents should still play a big part in dealing with the money.\nBut Yan Honglan, a mother of a 14-year-old boy in Beijing, has let her son be responsible  for his gift money since the age of 8. \"I want to develop his financial  skills, ' Yan said.\nShe also added:\"No matter how you deal with the money, the most important thing is to make the children feel they're respected  and trusted.\nChen supported Yan's idea. She said that though she knew her grandmother wouldn't waste her gift money, she would feel happier if she could at least know how the money is spent.\n\"It would make me feel a little bit more grown-up,\" she said.", "id": "middle1471.txt"}
