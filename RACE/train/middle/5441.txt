At the show I got a chance to try out lots of new, interesting equipment that might be introduced to schools. I thought some of it were great and would make learning more fun.\nCyber Coach Mat\nThe first thing I tried was the Cyber Coach Mat. This allows children to learn things like yoga  and tai chi  with virtual instructors . Also you can play football or have dance battles on it.\nSony PSP\nThe second piece of equipment I tried was the Play Station Portable. or PSP. It lets you access  lots of education materials and helps learning in many ways. It's really fun and even has a built-in camera and video so you can have fun with friends.\nLego NXT\nThe final thing I tried was the Lego NXT. This involves  building a robot and programming it to follow instructions .\nThe robot can pick up sound waves which can then be sent to the computer or a phone. I would really like to do this kind of thing in my lesson!\nOverall the fair was great and I learn how to use a lot of things that I think could really help children to learn and have fun at the same time.\nMy favourite was the Cyber Coach Mat because it allows you to learn new skills and it\"s a great way to do a PE lesson if it's cold and raining outside!", "id": "middle5441.txt"}
