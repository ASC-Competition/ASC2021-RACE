Have you ever written to your headmaster to express your idea? Here are some letters written by students from different schools.\nLuke, 14, from Jiangsu\nI will give some suggestions about our school uniform. In our school, we students have to wear uniform every day. But the yellow and green sports kit looks really dark and old. It can't stand for young and lively spirit. We can add some red or orange colors and make a new type of uniform. I hope our headmaster will think about it.\nDanny, 14, from Zhejiang\nI have two suggestions for my headmaster. First of all, I think we should have more hobby classes in science , such as plane model making class and computer programming class. It is really boring to study basic subjects all the time. And second, I hope we can have more PE lessons or more time for physical exercise. Lots of students now don't have a strong enough body.\nSam, 15, from Shanxi\nI'd like to say thank you to my headmaster. About one week ago, I got a bad cold after playing basketball. Our headmaster came to me after he knew about it. He took care of me until my parents came. I really want to thank him for that.\nHelen, 14, from Shandong\nIn the letter I wrote, I want to talk about the possibility of personal classes. Now many middle schools are trying the \"personal class\" system. Students don't have regular classes. They can choose lessons they want to take. _ And it is also good for exercise. We don't have to stay in one classroom all the time.", "id": "middle5012.txt"}
