Some students now have a new use for the Internet - helping them with their homework.\nTina, 14, from   Shenzhen, Guangdong, often searches online for the answers to her math problems. She said sometimes she and even her parents don't know the answers to the problems, so she has to turn to the Internet.\n\"I can see how other people work out these problems and learn from them,\" Tina said. \"It's easy and saves time.\"\nBut not all the students welcome this.
