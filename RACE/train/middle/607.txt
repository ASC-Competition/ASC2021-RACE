He is always in a hurry and in the end loses both time and his good name. A lost thing may be found again, but lost time can never be got back. Time is more useful than material things. In fact, time is life itself. An unpunctual man is always wasting his most important things as well as others'. An unpunctual person is always saying unhappily that he finds no time to answer letters or return calls. But the man who really has much to do is very careful of his time. He knows that he can not finish all his work unless he carefully does every piece of work.\nBeing unpunctual is the sign of disrespect ( _ ) towards others. If a person is invited to\ndinner and arrives later than the time when he should be there, he keeps all the other guests  \nwaiting for him. Usually this will be thought as a great disrespect to the host and all the other guests.\nNot like a punctual person, an unpunctual one can't do his duty wonderfully, whether it is public or personal. Imagine how it would be if those who should do important tasks failed to be on time. A man who is known to be often unpunctual is never believed by his friends or fellow men.", "id": "middle607.txt"}
