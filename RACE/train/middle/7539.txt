As we sat there eating and sharing conversation, I watched an old woman stop and look around. I looked over at my husband and said, \"She must be lost.\"\nI got up and caught up with her as she walked by our table and touched her lightly on the shoulder. \"Ma'am, are you having trouble finding who you are dining with?\" I asked.\nShe said yes. She was there with her daughter. I asked if her daughter was the only person she was there with, and she replied yes. \"If you stay right here, I will find her and come back and take you to her--to save you some steps,\" I offered. She looked at me and said, \"But you don't know who I am here with.\"\nShe was right. I explained that her daughter should be easy to find, because I thought she would be the only lady sitting by herself in the whole restaurant. She agreed...but just then a young man stopped me and asked, \"Is she looking for her seat? They're sitting at a table right across from us.\"\nI told him that she was and thanked him. I watched as they walked off together and kept my eyes on the old woman to make sure that she could see her daughter and all was well. I couldn't help but think that it must not be much different from being lost as a child. I wondered if I too would accept the help from strangers when I was as old as the lost woman.", "id": "middle7539.txt"}
