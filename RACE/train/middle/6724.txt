But designer Mikhail Belyaev doesn't think that forgetting to check the weather report before going out should cause you to get wet in the rain. That's why he created the Lampbrella--a lamp post  with its own \"umbrella\".\nThe designer says he came up with the idea after watching people get wet on streets in Russia. \"Once, I was driving on a central Saint Petersburg street and saw people trying to hide from the rain under the street lamps. I thought it would be a good idea to have a Lampbrella built into a street lamp.\" he said.\nThe Lampbrella is a street lamp fitted with an umbrella canopy . It has an inside electric motor  which can open or close the umbrella freely. The Lampbrella will offer people cover whenever it starts raining. After three minutes of not being used the canopy is closed.\nAccording to the designer, the Lampbrella would move at a very low speed in order not to cause harm to people. What's more, it would be grounded to protect from a possible lightning hit. Each Lampbrella would offer enough cover for several people. Being 2 meters off the ground, it would only be a danger for the tallest man.\nWhile there are no plans to take the Lampbrella into production , Belyaev says he recently introduced his creation to one Moscow company, and insists his creation could be on any street where a lot of people walk but there are no canopies to provide cover.", "id": "middle6724.txt"}
