The husband worked day and night to support the family but with no care of his wife. So she thought, \"he doesn't love me anymore, he just thinks about his work\".\nOne day, she wanted to take a shower, but her husband stopped her at the door, \"Let me take it first, OK?\" \"Why not let me first,\" she asked. \"I was tired, you take it later, OK?\" She was very sad.\nOn a rainy day, she found nothing to do and turned on his computer. After a few minutes, her eyes were full of tears...it was his diary:\n\"Today, I was quite sad, she asked me why I was always taking the shower first, and I said I was tired. She was unhappy. I wasn't as rich as before! We moved to the small house and it was very cold. But I found that if one person took the shower first, the room could get a little warmer. So every time I rushed to the bathroom first. When she took the shower, the room would get warmer, at least 1degC or 2degC.Now I can't give her comfortable life or buy expensive dresses for her,  but at least, I can give her 1degClove.\"", "id": "middle7732.txt"}
