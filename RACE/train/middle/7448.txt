The 75-year-old lived very happily in a village and had a beautiful family. Joe had four grandchildren, and they visited him during their holidays.\nDuring one vacation, Joe was preparing his home for the kids: cleaning and buying their favorite foods. After he finished working, he realized he lost his favorite watch. The watch was a gift from his wife when their first child was born. Joe loved the watch very much, especially after his wife's death. He was very upset about losing it.\nOnce his grandchildren came, they promised him they would find the watch.\nOne granddaughter asked: \"Grandpa, do you remember when you saw the watch last before it went missing?\"\n\"I guess when I was cleaning the barn !\" Joe replied.\nThe children looked for more than two hours with Joe, but they could not find it. The kids were now also sad, but they tried to comfort  their grandfather.\nOne grandson went back to the barn to search again. Joe asked why he was going there a second time. But the little boy just asked the others not to follow him and to remain silent.\nHe was there for about fifteen minutes and then rushed to his grandfather. He found the watch and happily gave it to Joe.\nJoe was surprised and asked how he was able to find it. The little boy replied: \"I sat there without making a noise, and the barn was so silent. After a few minutes, I heard the 'tick, tick' sound and found the watch.\"\nJoe hugged and thanked the little boy.", "id": "middle7448.txt"}
