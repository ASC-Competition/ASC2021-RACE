Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.\nThe dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.\nWith so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take \"pretty advantages\". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of \"which is which\" and \"what is what\" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real \"gentleman\". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others?", "id": "middle55.txt"}
