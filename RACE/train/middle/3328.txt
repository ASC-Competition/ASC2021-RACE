Here's how experts predict   what people will be like in 1,000 years.\nWe'll be about 1.83~2.13 metres tall because of improved nutrition   and medical science. Our arms and fingers will get longer to reduce the need to reach too far.\nWe'll have smaller brains, maybe because computers will help us memorize and think most of the things.\nThere will be larger eyes and smaller mouths. And there may be fewer teeth as softer food needs less chewing and biting. We could even get our nutrition from liquids or pills in the future.\nWe can expect other great changes too. Everyone will have the same shape of noses. That's because climate will have less influence on noses with the help of air conditioning and central heating. Besides, we will have more wrinkles   as a result of looking at our electronic devices.\nWe also may end up with saggy   necks because extra sun will cause loose skin. And there will be darker skin as people move around the planet and races   mix.\n,.", "id": "middle3328.txt"}
