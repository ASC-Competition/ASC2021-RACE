They start studying English at the age of 12. Most young Japanese people spend a lot of time and work hard at studying English, but Japanese people are not good at English.

They don't have enough chances to speak with them.\nJapan is an island country and they feel that other countries are far away. So they don't use English very often. And the Japanese feel that it is strange  to talk to each other in English.\nThe Japanese education doesn't always follow the educational trends  in the world.
