Ellen began to learn English at the age of fifty, and in just a few years, she has made great progress!\nEllen chose to study on Englishtown because no evening classes were offered in the German countryside where she lives. On Englishtown, she has conversation classes online and speaks with native English-speaking teachers.\n\"Englishtown is a wonderful place for study,\" she says. Ellen began with the first level   of Englishtown and quickly progressed. \"I spent hours and hours studying,\" she said. \"Maybe I wanted too much in a short time. I finished all my courses after 2 years, but I still had grammar difficulties.\"\nInstead of giving up, she chose to continue. After another two years on Englishtown, she's still studying in the online classroom. \"Studying online is never boring, but you need practice, practice, practice!\"\nEllen says studying English isn't all about hard work. It should also be fun. \"I really like the online conversation classrooms,\" she says. \"I have learned so much about other cultures and traditions.\"\nEllen has been able to put her English to use by visiting England five times! \"I'm very thankful to Englishtown because my life has improved because of it,\" Ellen says.", "id": "middle4267.txt"}
