Of course, you save time by reading fast, but this is not the main reason for fast reading. The main reason is that you understand better what you are reading when you read fast.\nAs your eyes move along the line of point, they make fixations   or pauses  . It is important that you see several words at a fixation. It is also important that your eyes leave a group. The numbers of letters or words that you see at a fixation are called your eye span  . Pay more attention to improving your rate of reading. With practice you can learn to read faster than you usually read.\nThe way in which you read always depends on   what you are reading and for what purpose. You should know the different ways of reading so that you can apply whatever method is necessary. Here are four ways of reading:\n(1) Skimming is an important kind of reading. This method can be used when you wish to review something that you have forgotten. You can skim to get the main points.\n(2) Rapid   first reading and then rereading certain parts carefully is important. You may use this type of reading to study a science lesson or a history lesson.\n(3) You need to do careful reading and rereading sometimes. This type of reading is necessary for making an intensive   study of your school subjects, solving math problems or reading directions.\n(4) Rapid reading is used when reading stories for enjoyment. You may also do rapid reading when reviewing materials that you already know well.", "id": "middle1613.txt"}
