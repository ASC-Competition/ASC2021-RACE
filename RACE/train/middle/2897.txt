Children born under Aquarius may be less clever than those born in other seasons. They may also have shorter lives than those born in autumn  Scientists believe many of the differences can be explained by the mother's exposure to sunlight in pregnancy .  Sunlight helps lead to the production of Vitamin D in the body. The lack of this in the first months of life may have a bad effect on mental and physical health.\nVitamin D, called the \"sunshine vitamin\", is known to help regulate  thousands of genes during development, according to a study of more than two million people. So Vitamin D has a good effect on health  This study showed that people born from April to June had slightly shorter lives than those born in October, November or December. Similar studies in the USA showed that people born in autumn lived about 160 days longer than those born in spring.\nProfessor Russell Foster, an Oxford University neuroscientist on seasonal biology, said the conclusions were surprising and interesting. He added, \"These are small effects but they are very, very clear. I am not giving voice to star signs and they are just for fun. But it is true that we are affected by our season of birth.\"", "id": "middle2897.txt"}
