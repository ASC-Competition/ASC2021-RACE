Somebody mentions hard-work, others suggest knowledge, love and luck.\nIf you arrange the 26 English letters alphabetically and use numbers to represent each of them, for example, 1 for a, 2 for b, 3 for c..., you can change an English word into a number. So hard-work becomes 8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11=\"98,\" meaning 98 is its mark; knowledge: 11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5=\"96,\" while love: 12+15+22+5=\"54,\" and luck: 12+21+3+11=\"47,\" a small mark. None of these words can give one a full mark. What about money? It can't , either.\nThen what else? Don't be worried. You can always find an answer to a problem in your life, when you change your way of looking at things or doing things, or your attitude. Yes, attitude is the word. See for yourself: attitude:1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5=100,a full mark.\nMost times people hope for a better life. It is possible if you will have a change for the better after you have changed your attitude. When you change your manner and become friendly to others, you'll meet more smiling faces towards you.", "id": "middle2144.txt"}
