Let's go to a fruit store first. I have something interesting to show you.\"\nAt the store, I told him that we needed to buy apples. And we bought some red apples, green apples and yellow apples.\nAfter we got home, I told Adam, \"It's time to answer your question.\" I put one of each type of apple on the table: first a red apple, followed by a green apple and then a yellow apple. Then I looked at Adam, who was sitting on the other side of the table.\n\"Adam, people are just like apples. They come in different colors, shapes and sizes. See, some may not even look as delicious as others.\" As I was talking, Adam was examining each one carefully.\nThen, I took each of the apples and peeled them, placing them back on the table, but in a different place.\n\"OK, Adam, tell me which one is the red apple, the green apple and the yellow apple.\"\nHe said, \"I can't tell. They all look the same now.\"\n\"Take a bite  of each one. See if that helps you tell which one is which.\"\nHe took big bites, and then a huge smile came across his face. \"People are just like apples! They are all different, but if you take off the outside, they're pretty much the same on the inside.\"\n\"Right,\" I agreed. \"Just like everyone has their own features but they are nearly the same.\"\nHe completely got it. I didn't need to say or do anything else.\nNow, when I eat an apple, it tastes a little sweeter than before. What perfect fruit it is!", "id": "middle7920.txt"}
