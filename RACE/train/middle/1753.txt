To get to the other side!\"\nThat's an old joke in the west, but it came to my mind again when I saw people crossing the road at the _ of Shanxi Road and Huaihai Road in Shanghai.\nWhen the traffic light was red, a group of people were waiting for the light to change. Suddenly one man began rushing to the other side of the road. Soon others followed him at the crossing and more people did the same. Just like chickens, they didn't mind the honking horns  and kept crossing the road in a mess.\nEvery year several thousand people are either killed or hurt on the roads in Shanghai. And at least one third of them were jaywalking . Jaywalking is very common in Shanghai. It seems that jaywalkers are not afraid of the danger to themselves.\nTraffic laws are to keep people safe. So we should obey them, and have good road-crossing habits. When someone starts to jaywalk, we should stop him, and never follow him. That way we can avoid the traffic accidents.", "id": "middle1753.txt"}
