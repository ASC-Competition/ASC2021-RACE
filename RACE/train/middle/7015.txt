And thank you for introducing  your Chinese friend Li Fang to me. You are the class monitor for this term. That's good. Work hard! Try to help your teacher.\nMy classmates choose me as the PE monitor in our class because I run very fast. My PE teacher and my classmates like me. They also want me to _ the PE Club.
