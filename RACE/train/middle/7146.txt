I could not find a satisfying job and I found this especially difficult as I had a lot of experience and a Master's degree.\nTo my shame I was driving a school bus to make ends meet and living with friends. I had been through five interviews with a company and one day between bus runs they called to say I did not get the job.\nLater that afternoon, while doing my rounds through a quiet neighborhood I had an internal(inside)wave--like a scream --come up from deep inside me and I thought \"Why has my life become so hard?\"...\nImmediately after this internal scream I pulled the bus over to drop off a little girl and as she passed she handed me an earring saying I should keep it in case somebody looked for it. The earring was stamped with words \"BE HAPPY\".\nAt first I got angry. Then it hit me. I had been putting all of my energies into what was wrong with my life rather than what was right! I decided then and there to make a list of 50 things I was thankful to.\nAt first _ was hard, then it got easier. One day I decided to up it to 75. That night there was a phone call for me, asking if I would do a one-day training for 200 hospital workers. I said yes and got the job.\nMy day with the hospital workers went very well. I got a standing welcome and many more days of work. To this day I KNOW that it was because I changed my attitude to _ .\nBy chance, the day after I found the earring the girl asked me if anyone had looked for it. I told her no and she said \"I guess it was meant for you then.\"\nI spent the next year doing training workshops all around the Seattle area and then decided to risk everything and go back to Scotland where I had lived before. I closed my one man business and bought a plane ticket. One month later I met my wonderful English wife and best friend of 15 years now. We live in a small beautiful house in Scotland.\n\"THE ONLY ATTITUDE IS GRATITUDE\" has been my motto  for years now and yes, it completely changed my life.", "id": "middle7146.txt"}
