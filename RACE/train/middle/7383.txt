For example, we can reuse paper and plastic bags. We can also recycle newspapers, glass, and cans   to make new things. Here are some useful ways to reduce waste.\n* Write on both sides of paper. Many people write on only one side of their paper. Why not stop wasting the other side? Some students only use half the pages of their notebooks before getting new ones. Try to use up all the paper. People often give cards on birthdays or festivals. How about trying to send e-cards instead?\n* Don't throw away your old batteries. Maybe you do not know that old batteries make the Earth dirty. This is because they have poisonous parts. So, don't throw away batteries. Keep them together. Try to use rechargeable  batteries for your games and CD players.\n* Donate   all your unwanted clothes. There are many poor families in China. You may ask your mother to collect your unwanted clothes. Then you can pass them on to those poor children who do not have clothes to wear. You will feel happy that you are helping someone else. Also, you can ask if your friends or relatives want them before throwing them away.", "id": "middle7383.txt"}
