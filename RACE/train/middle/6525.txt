One night Bob was at home alone while his parents were out for a party. He had often stayed alone before,so he wasn't afraid. As he waited for his parents to return home,he watched a film on TV. His eyes became heavier and heavier as time passed by.\nSuddenly Bob's eyes opened wide--what was the sound in the next room? Bob heard the window being opened slowly.
