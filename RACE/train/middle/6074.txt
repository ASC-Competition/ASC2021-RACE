I usually get up at 6:10 and it's difficult for me. At night I have to do lots of homework and I like to watch TV . I go to bed at about 11:00 pm. I usually can't catch the bus at 7:30 in the morning. I am often late for school.\"\nSally---\"I don't think it's a good idea. I always get up at 5:30 in the morning. It's the best time of the day. First I do some morning exercises. Then I read and have breakfast. So I will be happy if class begins at 8:00 .\"\nBilly---\"I never get up before 6:30.I always go to school without breakfast. A morning class is not good for me. I hope I can go to school after 8:30.\"", "id": "middle6074.txt"}
