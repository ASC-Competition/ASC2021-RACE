Our parents come and see our school on this day. Our school is very big and beautiful.There are five buildings in our school. Look! The office building is on your right. Our teachers work in it. Behind the building, there are two classroom buildings and a school library. In the library there are all kinds of books. Our big playground is on the left of these buildings with lots of trees around it. Every day, many students play football, basketball and tennis. We have a good time on the playground after school. We also have a school hall behind the playground next to the library. We meet our parents and have parties  in the school hall. Today, after school, we have a welcome party for our parents. I think our parents will like our school, too.", "id": "middle4553.txt"}
