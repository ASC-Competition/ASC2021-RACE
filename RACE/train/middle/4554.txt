He has led a group of college student volunteers since last year. They help children at a primary school with their studies and daily lives.\n\"When I was a small child\", Zhang said, \"I knew March 5 was a day for people to learn from Lei Feng and help others, but I didn't know the real meaning of the spirit  of Lei Feng. Now when I see the smiling faces of the kids I have helped, I deeply understand Lei Feng. Helping others makes me happy.\"\nLei Feng (1940-1962) is one of the most famous soldiers in Chinese history. He lost his parents when he was very young. His neighbors brought him up. He died in an accident at 22. He did many good deeds  in his short life. For example, he gave his own money to the parents of another soldier. And bought tickets for a woman he didn't know without telling her his name.\nOn March 5, 1963, Chairman Mao  called on  people to \"Learn from Lei Feng\" and made the day \"Lei Feng Day\".\nToday almost 50 years has passed since Lei's death. Some people say that the spirit of Lei Feng is outdated .\nBut many people think we need to promote  that spirit again. There have been many reports about the coldness of people toward strangers. This has made many Chinese people think deeply about themselves.\n\"The most important thing is that we must be ready to help others and make it a habit.\" said Huang Tianze, a student from Jianlan High School in Zhejiang.", "id": "middle4554.txt"}
