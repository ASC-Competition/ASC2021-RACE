Every day they are busy trying to earn money in order to pay the high tuition for my brother and me. They don't act in the romantic way that I read in books or I see on TV.  In their opinion. \"I love you\" is too luxurious for them to say. Sending flowers to each other on Valentine's Day is even more _ . Finally my father has a bad temper when he's very tired from the hard work, it is easy for him to lose his temper.\nOne day, my mother was sewing a quilt.

Love is inside.\"", "id": "middle5055.txt"}
