Do you know how the kids in different countries spend their holidays?\nChildren in China\nWhen spring comes, children want to be outside, so some schools usually organize  a spring trip for them. It could be a trip to a mountain. There, children can climb mountains, fly kites, enjoy flowers and so on. Sometimes their teachers take them to the Martyrs' Park. Students can put some flowers on the graves .\nChildren in Japan\nIn April, while the Chinese enjoy winter jasmines, the Japanese are enjoying cherry blossoms. This is the best time of the year for children to take a trip. They take picnic lunches, sing and dance under the trees.\nChildren in the UK\nThey have many great choices when it comes to the school trip. They can visit the seaside or a theme park. One of the most special places to go is the bird center. These children can see ducks and other birds. The people at the center are scientists.

The kids spend time in a beautiful place and also learn something about the natural world there without textbooks.", "id": "middle7466.txt"}
