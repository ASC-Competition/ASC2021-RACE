They talked happily. Then their talk soon turned to complaining about the stress   in work and life. The teacher went to the kitchen and came back with a large pot of coffee and many cups--china   ones, plastic ones and glass ones. Some are plain   looking, some are expensive and some are lovely. The teacher told them to help themselves to the coffee.\nWhen all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the teacher said, \"Can you notice that all of you took nice-looking expensive cups, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones? You want only the best for yourselves, and that is the source   of your problems.\"\n\"What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you went for the best cups and then began looking at each other's cups.\"\n\"Now think about this: life is the coffee, and the jobs, money and position   in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold, and do not change the life. Sometimes, by caring only about the cups, we fail to enjoy the coffee. So don't let the cups drive you, and enjoy the coffee instead.\"", "id": "middle6362.txt"}
