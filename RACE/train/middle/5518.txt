As a boy ,I always thought people simply bought whatever they need. Whether Grandfather knew this, I don't know. One day he said, \"Come, I have something for you.\"\nI followed him to a workroom. \"You should have a toy boat. You can sail it at Storvassdal.\" He said. Great, I thought,looking around for the boat. But there was none.\nGrandfather pointed to a block of wood. \"The boat is in there,\" he said. Then he handed me some tools and showed me how to use them properly. \"It'll be a fine boat,and you'll make it with your own hands,\" he said,\"No one can give you what you do for yourself.\" The words rang in my head as I worked. Finished the boat. It wasn't much to look at ,but I was poud. Then I sailed it at Storvassdal.\nWe had to return to America. \"You cannot bring that boat home with you,\" my mother said. We already had too much baggage. Feeling sad, I hid my boat under a big rock at Storvassdal.\nI said good-bye to Grandfather, not knowing I would never see him again.\nIn 1964, I went to Storvassdal with my parents and my wife and children. To my surprise,for 34 years my treasure stayed here,waiting for my return. I felt _ were togethet again although my grandfather had died 22 years before.\nI carved\"1930\"and\"1964\" on its side and put it back.\nI returned to the lake in 1968,1971,1977 and 1988. Each time I had the boat and carved the year,my grandfather seemed near.\nMy last trip to Storvassdal was in 1991. I brought my granddaughters: Catherine,13; Claire,12. I hoped they would understand the importance of the little boat and its simple message. At Storvassdal, Claire said softly, 'Grandpa,someday I'll come back.' She added,\"And I'll bring my children.\"", "id": "middle5518.txt"}
