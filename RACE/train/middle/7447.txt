In March 2016, AlphaGo, an AI program developed by Google, had the Go  match with Lee Sedol, a South Korean Go player. He is the world top player of this old Chinese game.\nIn October 2015, AlphaGo became the first computer program to beat a professional  human Go player. And this time, it beat Lee Sedol 4-1.\nIn fact, before the match, most people believed that Lee would certainly be the winner, because they didn't think that AI was good enough to beat the human mind. However, the result was disappointing. As a machine, AlphaGo would never get tired, while Lee Sedol was only a human and humans must have some weaknesses.\nAlphaGo's wins over a human champion  show that computers can do more difficult tasks. Some people may worry whether computers are now smart enough to beat us at everything. But scientists say that is not the case. Real life problems can be more difficult than the Go game. Thomas Johnson, a scientist of AI said, \"It's not hard to get a computer program to remember and produce facts. What is hard is getting computers to use knowledge in everyday situation. \" We believe we can use the technology of AI to improve the world.", "id": "middle7447.txt"}
