I remember waiting anxiously as my teacher Mr. Right passed out our papers one by one. It was a rather difficult test. I heard my classmates groaning , and I could tell by the groans that the scores weren't looking good.\nMr. Right put my paper on my desk. There in big red numbers, circled to draw attention, was my score, 55!\nI lowered my head, and covered the score up quickly. A 55 is not something that you wanted your classmates to see.\n\"The scores were not very good, none of you passed,\" Mr. Right said. \"The highest score in the class was a 55.\"\nA 55. That's me!\nSuddenly my sad look didn't look so bad. I had the highest score. I felt a lot better.\nI walked home alone that day with the low but high score. My father knew that I had a big test that day and asked me as soon as I got home, \"How did you do in your test?\"\n\"I made a 55,\" I said.\nA frown   now stood on my father's face. I knew I had to explain immediately. \"But Dad, I had the highest score in the class,\" I proudly stated. I thought that explanation would make a difference.\n\"You failed!\" my father replied.\n\"But it's the highest!\" I insisted.\n\"I don't care what scores others had, but you failed. What matters is what you do!\" my father firmly said.\nFor years, my father was always that way. It didn't matter what others did, it only mattered what I did and that I did it excellently.\nWe often don't understand the wisdom   of good parents until we ourselves stand in the parents' shoes. My father's words have carried me throughout life.", "id": "middle1931.txt"}
