Then he hid nearby to see if anyone would move the rock out of the way to make it convenient for others. Some of the king's wealthiest supporters came past and simply walked around it. Many others complained about the rock and some blamed the king for the problem. To the king's surprise, no one did anything about moving it out of the way.\nFinally, a poor farmer came along, carrying a load of old vegetables. When he saw the rock, he put down his load, and tried to move the heavy rock to the side of the road. No one stopped to help him. Many laughed at him and made jokes as they walked past. Finally, after much pushing and straining, and with no help , the farmer managed  to get the rock to the side of the road. As he bent down to pick up his vegetables, he noticed a small bag lying in the road, exactly where the rock had been. There was a lot of money and a note in the bag. The note was from the king saying that the money was for the person who moved the rock out of the way.\nTaking responsibility  is about solving hard problems. The farmer takes responsibility when no one else is prepared to. It does not always mean that you will get an instant reward, but it is a value that builds up a community, and makes life better for all of us.", "id": "middle1653.txt"}
