But tea does not mean the same thing to everyone. In different countries people have very different ideas about drinking tea.\nIn China, for example, tea is always served when people get together. The Chinese drink it at any time of the day at homes or in teahouses. They prefer their tea plain, with nothing else in it.\nTea is also important in Japan. The Japanese have a special way of serving tea called a tea ceremony . It is very old and full of meaning. Everything must be done in a special way in the ceremony. There is even a special room for it in Japanese homes.\nAnother tea-drinking country is England. In England, the late afternoon is \"teatime\". Almost everyone has a cup of tea then. The English usually make tea in a teapot and drink it with milk and sugar. They also eat cakes, cookies and little sandwiches at teatime.\nIn the United States people drink tea mostly for breakfast or after meals. Americans usually use tea bags to make their tea. Tea bags are faster and easier than making tea in teapots. In summer, many Americans drink cold tea -- \"iced tea\". Sometimes they drink iced tea from cans, like soda.\n,.", "id": "middle4431.txt"}
