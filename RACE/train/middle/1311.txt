On the steps of one building, a group of engineering students were discussing the exam. On their faces was confidence . This was their last exam and then they would graduate. With all these four years of college behind them, they felt ready to go into the world.\nThe professor had said they could bring any book or note they wanted, but they could not talk to each other. They went into the classroom happily. The professor gave them the papers. They smiled when they found that there were only five questions.\nThree hours passed and the professor began to collect the papers. The students no longer looked so confident . The professor faced the class. No one spoke. They just held papers in their hands.\nThe professor then asked, \"How many of you finished all five questions?\"\nNot a hand was raised.\n\"How many answered four?\"\nStill no hand.\n\"Three? Two?\"\nThe students looked worried in their seats.\n\"One, then?\" Certainly somebody finished one.\nHowever, nobody replied. The professor put down the papers. \"That is just what I thought,\" he said. \"I just want to tell you that, even though you have finished four years of engineering, there are still many things about the subject you don't know. These questions you could not answer are quite common in everyday practice.\" Then he added with a smile, \"You will all pass this course, but remember----even though you are now college graduates, your education has just begun.\"", "id": "middle1311.txt"}
