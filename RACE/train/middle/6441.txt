Sabal grows very quickly at first but a few years later, it will stop growing, so the tallest Sabal can't reach ten meters. But the fir is different, it grows very slowly at first but it never stops growing so it can grow very tall.\"\nThen his father took him to another fir. It was so tall, so strong. It can reach the sky. The father said to his son, \"Son, you are the fir.\"The boy understood his father's words. The boy became a very great scientist. Do you know who he is?
