My illness was reasonably   under control, I had a nice relationship with my husband, I did work, I didn't hate. It was, as I said, a good life.\nBut there's a saying that the good is the enemy of the best. I finally realized this one day, and began making my best life. I changed doctors and tried a new way that could relieve  my symptoms   , rather than just making them easier to deal with. I started talking more with my husband and listening to what he had to say. And I quit  my job and started working for myself.\nI have the best life I've ever had. I'd call it great. It is possible there's a better life for me, which would then be my \"best life\" , but for now I don't think so. I've started a business I love. My husband and kids are wonderful. I have a good friend and I'm close to my older sister who lives in town. Could it get better? I suppose so. But for me I think this is the best life I can have right now.\nThink more about your life. Where are you living? Are you in a job you just don't mind? What makes your life \"good\" ? Why isn't it great? What's the enemy of the best and what can you do about it?\nEnjoy your best life. We're only here for a short while, and we all need to have the best possible time we can. It's like going to Disney World. If you spend too much time standing in line waiting for the ride, pretty soon your time's up. Get out of the \"good\" line and have your best life.", "id": "middle147.txt"}
