For a true friend you must always be there for them, in good times and bad\".\n\"But I want to be everybody's friend! I need to share my time among everyone!\" Fiona argued.\n\"My dear, you're a lovely girl,\" said her mother, \"but you can't be a close friend to everybody. There just isn't enough time for everyone, so it's only possible to have a few true friends. The others won't be close friends\".\nHearing this, Fiona decided to change her ways so that she could finally have some true friends.
