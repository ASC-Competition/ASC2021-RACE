In the past, tie tree fruited every year, .so the man would get many pears. But now, the tree got old. There were no more pears for the man. So the ungrateful  man decided to cut the tree down. When he walked toward the tree with an axe  in his hand, the tree said to him, \"Please don't cut me down. I had so many pears for you in the past years. Now I will die soon. I only have a short time to live. Please don't kill a dying tree that has done so much for you.\"\n\"I'm sorry. I have to do so,\" the man said, \"because I need wood to make a chair.\" Then he began to wave  his axe. At that moment, a bird in the old tree shouted at him, \"Don't cut it down! Every time you go out and your wife  feels lonely, she will come out to the garden and sit under the tree to enjoy its cool shade  , and I sing songs to make her happy. We give much joy to your wife when you are away from home.\"\nThe man didn't listen to the bird and drove it away. Just when he was about to cut the tree, some bees flew out of it and said, \"Listen! If you agree not to kill this tree, we will give you nice honey  every day. Would you please leave the tree with us?\"\nThe man got moved . He said, \"You are so kind to the tree, although  it has become old. Now I see that I shouldn't cut it down. It has done so much for me and my wife. Let the tree stay here, and let the bird _ its songs here.\" With these words, the man left. And the old tree lived there to its last day.", "id": "middle6277.txt"}
