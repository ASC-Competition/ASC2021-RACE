Sometimes she said I was thin. Sometimes she said I was lazy. Sometimes she said I wasn't a good student. Sometimes she said I talked too much, and so on. I tried to put up with  her as long as I could. At last, I became very angry. I ran to my father with tears in my eyes.\nHe listened to me quietly, and then he asked, \"Are the things she said true or not? Mary, didn't you ever wonder what you're really like? Go and make a list of everything she said and mark the points that are true. Pay no attention to the other things she said.\"\nI did as he told me and to my surprise, I discovered that about half the things were true.\nI brought the list back to my dad. He refused to take it. \"That's just for you,\" he said. \"You know better than anyone else the truth about yourself. When something said about you is true, you'll find it will be helpful to you. Don't shut your ears. Listen to them all, but hear the truth and do what you think is right.\"\nMany years have passed. The situation often appears in my mind. In our life we often meet with some trouble and we often go to someone and ask for advice. For some advice you will treasure   all your life!", "id": "middle3059.txt"}
