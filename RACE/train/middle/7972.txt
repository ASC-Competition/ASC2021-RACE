To build a house , you need workers. They use their hands , tools  and machines to put things together. Building the ISS  is the same. The difference is that the workers are astronauts. They walk in space and use robots' arms and hands to do their work.\nIn the space station ,astronauts are comfortable. The temperature there is about 21degC.But outside the station , it can be too hot or cold for people. In the sunlight, it's about 120degC. In the shadow of the station, it's about -85degC . So when astronauts walk in space , they have to wear heavy clothes---- _ s.\nSpacesuits also keep astronauts safe from flying rubbish in space.Each time people go into space , they leave rubbish there. So astronauts should be careful because there's a lot of rubbish, some rubbish goes many times as fast as a plane !\nSpace walking is not easy , and it can be dangerous. So getting ready for it takes a lot of time to learn. Astronauts will need to do 160 space walks to finish their work in the ISS. That will take about 1,900man-hour of work.", "id": "middle7972.txt"}
