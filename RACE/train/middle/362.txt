In the morning she phoned her mother to wish her a happy Mother's Day, and her mother told her about the beautiful lilacs in the garden.\nLater that day, when she told her husband about the lilacs, he said, \"I know where we can find all that you want. Get the children and come on.\" So they went, driving down the country roads. There on a small hill, they saw a lot of beautiful purple lilacs. The young woman ran quickly to enjoy the flowers. Carefully, she picked a few here and there. On their way home there was a smile on her face.\nWhen they were passing an old people's home, the young woman saw an old granny sitting in a chair. They stopped the ear and the young woman walked to the old woman, put the flowers in her hands, and smiled at her. The old granny thanked her again and again. She smiled happily, too.\nWhen the young mother came back to her car, her children asked her, \"Who is the old granny? Why did you give our flowers to her?  I don't know her,\" their mother said. \"But it's Mother's Day, and she has no children. I have all of you, and I still have my mother. Just think how much those flowers meant to her.\"", "id": "middle362.txt"}
