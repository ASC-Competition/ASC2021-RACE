Avanti was a very clever man. People liked him because he not only spoke for the poor but also was always ready to help them.\nOne day Avanti walked on the street and saw two men arguing with each other. A lot of people stood around them. One of the two men was the owner of the eating house in the town and the other was a young man. The young man just passed by the eating house. The owner of the eating house told the young man to pay him money. The young man explained that he hadn't taken anything from the eating house. But the owner said that the young man had taken the smell of the nice food from the eating house, and he must pay for it. So Avanti went up to the owner and said, \" I'll pay you the money.\" Avanti took out some coins  from his pocket and put them into his bags.
