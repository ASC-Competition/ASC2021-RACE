This morning, however, she met nobody and heard only the sounds of animals.\nSome time later, Andi got to the steep slope , she climbed up to the top by using her hands. When she finally reached the top, she noticed a dark shape several inches from her left foot. She was frightened and then looked carefully. \"It's a dog and it's dead.\" she said to herself. It took her a few seconds to realize that the dog's eyes were open. A thin, dirty bull dog was looking at her.\nShe greeted in a low and soft voice to show she was friendly. The bull dog shook when he heard her voice.\nAndi inched closer and dropped some water into the dog's mouth. He tried to stand up but failed. Something was wrong with his left front leg.
