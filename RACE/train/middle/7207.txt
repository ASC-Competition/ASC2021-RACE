Is it becoming famous, rich, coming up with an idea that changes people's lives, or helping others and feeling happy?\nPeople who have a billion dollars, for example, are they successful? Why don't they stop trying to make money then? Why would they possibly need more than a billion dollars? They try to make more because there will never be enough . They will never be happy enough.\nIf all that you're working for is money, you will do terrible things to get it. If all that you want is a successful business, you will cheat people to get it . If all that you want is fame ,you will give up your _ to achieve it .\nWhat's the real success? For me, being rich or famous is not all to life. I might have a lot of readers now on Zen Habits, but I don't feel that's what makes me a success. I've been a success even when I had no readers, because I was doing what I loved. Even when no one else would have called me a successful man. I loved writing, and I was happy. Success isn't about achieving something in the future, but about doing something right now that you love.\nSo, forget about success, and just find joy and love right now, in this moment. That is a success you can achieve, without any method. Just go out and do it.", "id": "middle7207.txt"}
