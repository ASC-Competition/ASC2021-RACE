I'm too busy!\"\nThe boy soon became silent as tears  fell down from his big blue eyes. Feeling sorry, the father said, \"You can finish the kisses later .\"\nThe boy said nothing but quietly walked away. That evening the father said, \"Come and finish the kisses now, Andrew!\" But the boy didn't.\nUnluckily, a few days later, the boy had an accident and died.

Nothing is more important than loving the people who are important to us.", "id": "middle6437.txt"}
