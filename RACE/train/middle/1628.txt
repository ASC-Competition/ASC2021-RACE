At the end of the day, while marking the compositions, she read one that impressed her deeply. Her husband, who had just walked in, saw her crying and asked her, \"What happened?\"\nShe answered, \"Read this. It is one of my students' compositions.\"\n\"Dear God, tonight I ask you for something very special: Make me into a television. I want to take its place and live like the TV in my house. Have my own special place, and have my family around me. To be taken seriously when I talk. I want to be the centre of attention and be heard without interruption  or questions. I want to receive the same special care that the TV receives even when it is not working. Have the company of my dad when he arrives home from work, even when he is tired. And I want my mom to want me close when she is sad and upset, instead of ignoring  me. And ...I want my brothers to fight to be with me...I want to feel that my family just put everything aside, every now and then, just to spend some time with me. And last but not least, make sure that I can make them all happy and entertain them. God, I don't ask you for much. I just want to live like our TV. \"\nAt that moment the husband said, \"My God, poor kid, what horrible parents!\" .The teacher looked up at him and said, \"That composition is our son's!\"", "id": "middle1628.txt"}
