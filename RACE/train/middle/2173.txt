But does this mean more and more people are getting into reading the digital way?\nAccording to the National Reading Survey, before the 17thWorld Reading Day on April 23, only 1.2 percent of Chinese people said they read a lot. But 38.6 percent said they read on digital devices like cell phone and e-books. This is a 17.7 percent increase from 2010.\nMany experts are talking about a trend toward fragmented reading --reading many short messages or items on a digital device like a cell phone instead of one long text in a book.\nZhao jianmin, a professor at Shanghai University, said fragmented reading was part of modern life. \"The fast _ of life leaves many people no time to sit and read a whole book,\" he said. \"So making use of fragmented time to read is sure to be a trend\"\nFragmented reading has its advantages. People can enjoy large amounts of information, knowledge and entertainment in a short time. Digital reading is faster than traditional deep reading.\nHowever, some experts fear the trend of digital reading will lead people to read in a simple way. Xu Guosheng, at a Chinese Academy of Press and Publication, says fragmented reading makes it harder for people to think more about what they read. He also warned fragmented reading could make people lazy about remembering facts because they know they can always just search for answers online.\n\"Fragmented reading is sometimes good, but don't let it take all your time,\" suggested Tian Zhilng, an editor. He said it was important to read quality books in a deeper way, and we should read for knowledge, for practical use and for pleasure. He suggested people choose easy books first, then move onto more difficult ones.", "id": "middle2173.txt"}
