One day my mother was cooking and I was playing with my younger brother Tony. Suddenly I ran to my mother and said: \"Tony fell from the open window!\" She was very worried and ran out of the kitchen. Then I said: \"Don't worry, I'm just joking.\" My mother shouted at me, \"If you do it again, I'll hit you.\"\nAnother day I went swimming with my friends in the sea. I wanted to play a joke on them. In the beginning I swam fast and I called out \"Help!\". All my friends came to help me. However, they found that I was joking. But half an hour later I wasn't joking. I was so fast, soon I got tired and couldn't swim on in water. I tried my best to call my friends for help, but this time nobody came to help me.\nIn the end they found I was telling the truth. They came and saved my life. They took me to the hospital. This is the best lesson in my life. From then on I haven't joked on anyone.", "id": "middle1790.txt"}
