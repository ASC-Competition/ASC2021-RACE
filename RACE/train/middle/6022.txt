I went to Chicago and knocked at the door of every station. But unluckily , I was refused every time.\nAt one station, a kind lady told me that big stations wouldn't hire   an inexperienced person and suggested that I try my luck at smaller stations. Following her advice, I went back to Dixon, where I had grown up. There were no radio-announcing jobs in Dixon, and my father said a newly-opened store wanted a local athlete to work for it. I applied for the job, but I was refused again.\n\"Everything happens for the best,\" Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to look for a job. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.\nAs I left his office, my frustration(,) boiled over. \"How can I become a sports announcer if I can't get a job in a radio station?\" I asked aloud.\nWhile I was waiting for the elevator, I heard someone calling.

Something wouldn't have happened if not for\" that previous disappointment.", "id": "middle6022.txt"}
