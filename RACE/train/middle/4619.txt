Another school day begins, and we all wish we could have just one extra hour of sleep.\nFor lucky high school students in England, they're now going to reset their alarm and get an extra hour of sleep. Instead of starting school at 9 am, students will begin the academic day at 10 am.\nThis is part of a huge study by Oxford University. The experiment will see whether later classes can improve exam results.\nMore than 100 schools across England will join the four-year experiment, which includes tens of thousands of students. It is based on(...) scientific evidence(; )that teenagers are out of step with traditional school hours.\n\"We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager,\" lead sleep researcher Colin Epsie told The Telegraph. \"Your parents think it's because you're lazy and everything would be OK if you could get to sleep earlier. But science is telling us that teenagers need to sleep more in the mornings.\"\nA similar experiment in 2009 saw an improvement of 19 percent in exam scores for major subjects - such as math and science.\nTeenagers' sleep cycles, on average, begin two hours after adults. Neuroscientists   say teens have a built-in clock, which makes them more likely to go to sleep around midnight. As well as not feeling fully awake until between 9 am and 10 am. This body clock stays until the age of 19 for females and 21 for males.\nSchools are places for learning, as well as education laboratories - finding out the best ways to learn and increase knowledge. Yet we'll have to wait until 2018 to find out these exciting results!", "id": "middle4619.txt"}
