He's very busy and has no time to have a good rest. Every evening, when he comes back from his office, he's always tired and wants to go to bed early. But his wife often has a lot of interesting things to tell him after dinner. She doesn't stop talking until she falls asleep  . But it's usually too late and Mr White has to get up early in the morning when she is still sleeping.\nOne day Mr White felt terrible and couldn't go to work. He decided to go to see a doctor.
