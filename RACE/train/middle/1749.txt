The crow watched them with disdain .\n\"You have no flying skills at all!\" he said to the swans. \"All you can do is to move your wings. Can you turn over in the air? No, that's beyond you. Let's have a flying competition. I'll show you what real flying is!\"\nOne of the swans, a strong young male, took up the challenge. The crow flew up and began to show his skills. He flew in circles, performed other flying tricks, and then came down and looked proudly at the swan.\nNow it was the swan's turn. He flew up, and began flying over the sea. The crow flew after him, making all kinds of comments  about his flying. They flew on and on till they couldn't see the land and there was nothing but water on all sides. The crow was making fewer and fewer comments. He was now so _ that he found it hard to stay in the air, and had to struggle to keep himself from falling into the water.\nThe swan pretended  not to notice, and said, \"Why do you keep touching the water, brother? Is that another trick?\"\n\"No,\" said the crow. He knew he had lost the competition. \"I'm in trouble because of my pride! If you don't help me, I'll lose my life...\"\nThe swan took pity on him, and took him on his shoulders and flew back to the beach.", "id": "middle1749.txt"}
