Like many other parents, I worry  that my children watch too much TV. Why? First, there are lots of bad programmes   on TV. They may learn from them. Second, watching too much TV is bad for their eyes. Many students wear glasses because they watch TV for long hours. Third, watching too much TV makes children think little . I think it is very important for children to read some books. Reading books makes children think more. When I tell this to my children, they just don't listen to me. So I decide to sell the television set. Maybe it is a good idea.", "id": "middle1984.txt"}
