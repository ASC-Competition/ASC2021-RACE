Nearly 50% of students say they are worried about robbery on the way to and from school. Now in main big cities in China, some schools have taught an unusual lesson: self-protection. Students like this lesson because there are no exams or boring classes. And they can learn how to save lives and know how to get away from danger before it really happens.\nChen Haoyu, a teacher at Beijing No. 25 Middle School, gives young students advice on how to deal with danger.\nIf you are robbed \nKeep calm if you can not cry for help or run away. Give the robber your money. Try to remember\nwhat the robber looks like and tell the police later.\nIf you are in a traffic accident\nIf a car hits you, you should remember the car number. If it is a bicycle, try to call your parents before you let the rider go. This is because you don't know how seriously you are hurt.\nIf it is raining hard and there is lighting \nDon't stay in high places and stay away from trees.\nIf there is a fire\nGet away as fast as yon can. Put wet things on your body and try to find an exit . Do not take the lift.\nIf someone is drowning \nIf you can't swim, don't get into the water. Cry out for help.\nRemember that danger is never as far away as you think. Take care of yourself at all time!", "id": "middle7862.txt"}
