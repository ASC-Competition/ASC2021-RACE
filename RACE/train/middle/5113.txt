You should start looking for information now ,because the more  information you have about each college,the better choice you can make.\nThere are two good ways to get information you need.One is a general reference book,called Guide to American Colleges and Universities.The other good source of information is the catalogue published by each school.\nYou can study the general guide in almost any American library.This book has a lot of useful\ninformation,such as the number of students,the average test score for people accepted to the school,and the number of books in the library.You can also find the address of each school in this book.\nAlthough the general guidebook has helpful information,some of the facts may be out-of-date.For example,many school raise their tuition every year.Since you'll need to know what your education will cost,out-of-date information will not be good enough.To be sure that you are getting the latest information,write to the university and ask for its catalogue.The catalogue not only has more detailed information.For example,the catalogue can tell you what kinds of courses are offered,and what kind housing there is in the school.Some universities have places for you to live in,but at  others you have to find your own place to live.\nWith all this information,you should be able to pick out several good schools.", "id": "middle5113.txt"}
