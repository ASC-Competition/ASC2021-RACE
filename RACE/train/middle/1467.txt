But some parents never learned from good examples. In New York City, Covenant House tries to help homeless young mothers become good parents.\nThe twelve or so teenagers who live at the shelter attend parenting classes four days a week. The class is called Mommy and Me.\nTeacher Delores Clemens is a mother of five and a grandmother. She teaches basic skills, like how to give a baby a bath and how to dress a baby in different seasons.\nShe remembers one student who learned from her mother not to pick up a crying baby. The mother said that would only make the child needy.\n\"I said 'That's not true. You have to hold your baby! He is crying for a reason. If you never pick him up, he's going to keep crying. Pick your baby up. Hug him! And she started to do that. They just want a little hugging and a little love. And it works!\" Delores Clemens said.\nDelores Clemens says her students also learn how to be good mothers by letting themselves be mothered. \"I'm doing something for them that never has been done for them before.\"\nIn class, with her baby son, is Natasha. She lived on the streets. She is glad not only for the warmth and shelter of Covenant House. As she told reporter Adam Phillips, she is also glad for the help they offer in looking for a safer life.\n\"Did you go to high school?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Did you graduate?\"\n\"No, I didn't. I was in my last year and then, I got pregnant and I got lazy.\"\n\"You look like you are willing to accept responsibility for that.\"\n\"Yes, I am, and I would like to finish.\"\nSome teenage mothers wish they themselves could be children again. 18-year-old Placida knows that feeling. \"Because you have to get up every two hours in the middle of the night, and you can't go out and say 'I am going to buy this for myself.' No. I have to buy pampers, clothes and food. So now it's two. So it's very hard.\" Placida said.", "id": "middle1467.txt"}
