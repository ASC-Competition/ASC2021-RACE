But being a student, Dudley didn't have the money to get braces . So, he decided to\n3-D print his own and marked down the DIY project in a recent blog post. His braces totaled less than $60, and after wearing them for 16 weeks, his teeth are also getting straighter.\nMonths ago, he mentioned on his blog that he avoided smiling for a while because he was unhappy with his teeth.\nHowever, clear braces can get pricey, costing up to $8,000. But after studying some images of these expensive clear braces, something comes up on him--they looked like that one which can come from a 3-D printer.\nSo he decided to hit up his school's 3-D printing equipment and scanned and printed models of his teeth. He\nthen made non-harmful plastic molds   around them to make 12 sets of braces.\nDudley, who does not recommend attempting any of this at home said that he didn't ask a dentist for his project. But the student did get information from journal articles and textbooks. And though this was a perfectly\nfriendly choice to buy braces. He didn't accept the project just to save money--he was also up for the challenge. \"When I realized that I could do something that was a little bit special, while proving my skills as a designer\nand a maker, and fixing something that was making me self-conscious for actually free, I felt it was more than worth the risk.\" he said.", "id": "middle7670.txt"}
