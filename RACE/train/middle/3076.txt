I was washing new jeans and a shirt of my 16-year- old stepson , Brett. He drank a lot last night. The clothing was already dirty.\nI was very tired. The clothes were just one thing. He had already kicked a large hole in his bedroom wall. Many windows were broken because of his breaking in to steal money. Brett came to live with us when he was 12 years old. During those four years I had dealt with Brett as patiently as possible, but inside I was feeling sad. Later, I cheered up again and continued parenting Brett. Still, Brett did not change his behavior.\nWhen Brett was nearly 18, my husband and I decided to send Brett to a boarding school that had very good result with troubled teenagers.\nAt the graduation ceremony the graduates stood one by one to thank those who had helped them. Each graduate held a rose to give to the person who had meant the most to him or her.\nBrett spoke lovingly to me, \"You did so much. You were always there, no matter what\nhappened.You always showed me such love. And I want you to know that I love you for \"it\".\nSurprised, I stood as Brett placed the white rose in my hand and hugged me hard.
