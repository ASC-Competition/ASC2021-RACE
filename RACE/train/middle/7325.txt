It is important for us all to avoid being fooled by such information. Here are three examples of Internet hoaxes.\nOn his website, a man by the name of Tony has asked for gifts of money to save the life of a pretty little rabbit named Toby that he rescued from under his house. A cat must have attacked the rabbit, the man claimed, so he took it in. he gave Toby loving care and nursed him back to health. There is a very cruel point, however. If the greedy man doesn't receive enough money, he will eat poor little Toby. (Don't worry, though.\nRemember, it's just a hoax!.\nWhile the streets of New Orleans, the USA, were still flooded after a terrible hurricane (., a frightening e-mail was sent around the Internet. It included a photograph of a large crocodile over five meters long. According to the message, it had been swimming around the flooded city eating people. It was later discovered that the photographs of the crocodile were of one that was caught in the Congo (. years before.\nThe following e-mail hoax takes in many people. It claims that a large British company will pay you to send their e-mail to as many people as possible. For every person that you send the e-mail to, it promises you will receive $5.00; for every person that you send it to that sends it to someone else, you'll get $3.00; and for every third person that receives it, you will be paid $1.00.\nTo make it even more believable, the sender says that at first he thought it was a hoax, but the company soon sent him $800.00.", "id": "middle7325.txt"}
