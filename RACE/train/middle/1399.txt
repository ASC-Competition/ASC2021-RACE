Winter is coming and it is easy for people to catch flu. Many people have started taking vitamin C pills as a precautionary way. But a research has shown that vitamin C pills do not provide as much protection as they think. They are even not as good as other ways, like often washing your hands. Some German scientists have given people information and a test on the subject helping to stop incorrect ways.\nWhether it is caused by cold or flu , a runny nose and sore throat are signs of catching a cold. Many people overestimate  the advantages of vitamin C and other pills. For years it was believed that taking vitamin C pills not only provided protection against colds but also against cancers, helping people to live longer. But the result of the research showed disagreement on these beliefs . The result has now come out on the website wwww.informedhealthonline.org. \"Some pills may not help people live longer. Some pills may even lead to earlier death,\" says Professor Peter Sawicki. Scientists also say that the best way to get vitamins is through food instead of having vitamin pills. That is to say, we disagree with the way of taking vitamin C pills.\nThere are many simple but useful ways to lower the risk of catching a cold. These include often washing your hands with normal soap  and water and not touching your face with your hands. People who have already had a cold can stop it from spreading by throwing away tissues  at once after using them and not shaking hands with other people.", "id": "middle1399.txt"}
