Although the 64-page  handbook  contains  suggestions for Chinese tourists when traveling at home, the main purpose is to improve the poor reputation of Chinese tourists abroad.\nIn 2013, more than 83 million Chinese people traveled overseas, up 18 percent from the year 2012, according to  the  China  Tourism  Academy. But  even as they travel farther, the Chinese tourists continue to take bad habits with them.  From damaging ancient Egyptian temples to letting children defecate in the  middle  of airports,   Chinese tourists have earned a bad fame. Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang even  stressed  the  need for Chinese tourists to behave better while traveling overseas so as to protect China's image abroad.\nNow with the latest \"guidebook\", Chinese travelers should have no excuse for rude behavior. According to the guidelines, when using the restroom,  Chinese tourists are asked not to forget to flush the toilet after using it.\nThe guidelines also remind tourists of not fighting with others  when they want to take pictures at tourist attractions. When flying, the guidelines advise  travelers  not to take life vests away from airplanes.\nChinese tourists are also encouraged to be respectful of local customs wherever they travel.  In the United Kingdom, for example, it is not polite to ask people. Where are you going?\" or \"Have you eaten?\", the handbook says.\nNevertheless, with a very short history of traveling overseas, it is not surprising that many Chinese tourists behave badly on their foreign trips. We should give them time to change.\n,.", "id": "middle4522.txt"}
