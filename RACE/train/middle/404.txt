Some eye doctors say this leads to an increase in \"computer vision syndrome .\"\nNathan Bonilla-Warford is an optometrist in Tampa, Florida. He has seen an increase in problems in children. \"A lot more children come into the office either because their parents have noticed that they have headaches or red or watery eyes or discomfort, or because their nearsightedness appears to be increasing and they're worried,\" he says.\nDr. Bonilla-Warford says part of the problem is that children may be more likely to pay no attention to early warning signs than adults. \"Even if their eyes start to feel uncomfortable or they start to get a headache, they're less likely to tell their parents, because they don't want to have the game or the computer or whatever taken away,\" he explains.\nHe says another part of the problem is that people blink less often when they use digital devices. He says, \"A person who uses an electronic device blinks about one third as much as we normally do in everyday life. And so that can result in the front part of the eye drying and not staying protected like normal.\"\nEye doctors offer suggestions like following which is known as the 20/20/20 rule. That means every twenty minutes look away twenty feet or more for at least twenty seconds from whatever device you're using.\nOther suggestions include putting more distance between you and the device and using good lighting. Of course, another way is to spend less time looking at screens. Many experts say children should spend no more than two hours a day using digital devices--with no screen time for children under two.\nBut not all eye doctors have noticed an increase in problems in children. Dr. David Hunter, from Children's Hospital Boston, has not seen an increase in his practice. \"While it is possible to develop _ looking at screens for a long period of time, there's certainly no proof that it actually causes any damage to the eyes.\" he says.", "id": "middle404.txt"}
