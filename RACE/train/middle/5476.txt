These people are called the \"Heads-down Tribe\" . Are you a heads-down tribe member? Heads-down tribe members now can be seen everywhere.\nUsing mobile phones may cause accidents and even cost a lot of money. Also, more and more interesting and strange facts happen to the \"Heads-down Tribe\". Let's have a look at an interesting TV report. A man in America kept using his mobile phone on his way home. As a result, he bumped into a big lost bear on the street. When he lifted his eyes from the phone,he was so scared that he turned around and ran away as quickly as possible. Another fact is that we can often see people in the restaurant eating face to face but looking at their own mobile phones. It's strange that they don't talk to the ones who sit opposite to them during the meal. Some of them even have fun communicating with others on the phone.\nMobile phones are helpful and necessary tools for modern life. Are mobile phones good or bad? It depends on how people use them. Let's be \"healthy\" users and try to be the \"Heads-up Tribe\".", "id": "middle5476.txt"}
