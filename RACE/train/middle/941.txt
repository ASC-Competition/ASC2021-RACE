A person called William Randolph Hearst built it between 1922 and 1939, at a cost of more than $30 million. Last year, I had a trip to that castle.\nI spent the whole day looking around. But there was much to see, and a day wasn't enough. Hearst Castle has four houses. The main house, \"Casa Grande\", is the biggest one. Visitors can live in the other three ones. Many of them are Hollywood film stars, and they often come to the parties there.\nAt Hearst Castle, there are also beautiful gardens and two swimming pools, one inside and a larger one outside. I loved the one outside, the \"Neptune Pool\". It was a pity that we couldn't go swimming there!\nThe guide told us that Mr. Hearst travelled around Europe with his mother at the age of ten and looked at paintings and castles. He never forgot that tour and wanted his house to look like a castle. When Mr Hearst died in 1951, his family gave Hearst Castle to the people of California. Now it's a museum.", "id": "middle941.txt"}
