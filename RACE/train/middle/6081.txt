We watch and read sports news. There are also sports clubs,\nand even sports-only channels  on TV. In many countries, players make millions of dollars every year. But why are sports so important? They're only games, right?\nOur readers answer:\nVlad (Ukraine)\nSports bring people together. In 2006, our team was able to play in the 2006 World Cup for the first time. Everyone was happy. Rich and poor, old and young, men and women--everyone was in the streets together!\nMike (U.S.A.)\nSports bring people together, but they divide them too. Fans of different teams fight all the Time\n-they shout and hit each other. And here's another example: My brother plays high school baseball.Last week, his team played an important game.

And that is good for Africa.", "id": "middle6081.txt"}
