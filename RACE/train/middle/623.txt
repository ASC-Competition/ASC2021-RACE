Some people heard about it, but very few of them know what to do with it.\nThere is a story about an English sailor   who went to countries in the east, the west and the south. He went to India and China. One day he came home and brought some tea as a present for his mother. She told her friends about the present and asked them to a \"tea party\". When her friends came to the \"tea party\", the old woman gave them brown tea-leaves. The old woman's friends began to eat them. Of course, nobody liked the tea-leaves.\nAt that time the sailor came in. He looked at the table and said, \"Mother,what did you do with the tea?\"\n\"I boiled it,as you said.\"\n\"And what did you do with the water?\"\n\"I threw it away ,of course.\" answered the old woman.\n\"Now you may throw away the leaves,too,\" said her son.", "id": "middle623.txt"}
