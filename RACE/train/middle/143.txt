In the last forty years, business contacts between Japan and the West have become very important. Many foreign companies now have offices in Japan and Japanese businessmen do business around the world. Differences between Japanese and Western ways of doing business, however, often _ and make doing business in Japan difficult for foreigners.\nThe American businessman, for example, wants to start talking business immediately. He does not want to wait. The Japanese businessman, on the other hand, likes to arrive at decisions after giving them serious thought. Another thing foreign businessmen have difficulty in understanding is when a Japanese means \"Yes\" or \"No\". This is because of cultural differences between Japanese and Western society , Which make it difficult for a Japanese to say \"No\" directly.\nIn the USA, it is easy to say \"No\" to something one does not want to do.
