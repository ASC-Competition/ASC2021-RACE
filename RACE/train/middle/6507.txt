Nobody was ever sick or sad.\nAt that time there lived a little girl named Pandora. One day a fairy gave her a wonderful box. The fairy made Pandora promise not to open it. Pandora and her friends often looked at the box and wondered what was in it.\nFor a long time Pandora kept her promise, but at last she couldn't help herself. She opened the box a little. Then hundreds of bad fairies flew out. They stung   Pandora and her friends. The bad fairies flew out of the door and stung all the children in the land. Then Pandora heard a voice crying, \"Let me out, and I will help you.\"\nShe opened the box again, and a beautiful fairy flew out. She told Pandora that her name was Hope. She kissed Pandora and her friends, and made them feel well. Then she flew away to help the other children.\nUntil now, when people are sick or unhappy, the little good fairy, Hope, comes to comfort them.", "id": "middle6507.txt"}
