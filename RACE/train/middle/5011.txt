Yutu later separated  from the lander and ran to the moon surface earlier Sunday.\nChina has chosen the name Yutu for its first moon rover, after a worldwide online vote  attracted people to come up with names.\nIn Chinese folk tale, Yutu is the white pet rabbit of Chang'e, the moon goddess. Chang'e took her pet and flew towards the moon. She became a goddess and has lived there with the white animal ever since.", "id": "middle5011.txt"}
