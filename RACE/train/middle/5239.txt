But they are enough reasons for viewers to spend an hour every Friday until June 6 enjoying in front of their television sets. Viewers  have had to wait a long time since A Bite of China 1 came out in 2012.\nBack then, the seven-episode documentary was considered the best one ever produced by CCTV, with its good effects and rich food culture. A famous foreigner praised it, saying \"it's the best TV show I've ever seen about food. I'm sure it's the best one ever made. \"\nThe new season includes eight episodes, covering 300 types of food. According to CCTV, every minute of the show was edited  out of 150 minutes of footage . Finding their subjects was often the hardest part of the film team's job. It took them six months to film a beekeeping couple , which included a journey of more than 2,000 kilometers.\nFood is a personal thing, in that no dish suits all tastes. However, the program has still managed to move all sorts of viewers. \"Compared with A Bite of China 1, the new season has a more human touch, which makes viewers cover some tears while their mouths are watering,\" said Sina  Entertainment.\nAs always, the people are the most interesting part. A Bite of China 2 shows a greater dream--through homemade food, it tells the joys and _ of common Chinese in changing times, according to director Chen Xiaoqing of the documentary series .\n\"I was moved by the people in each simple story,\" said Li Weifang, 17, of Beijing No 3 High School. \"Their work helps enrich  China's food culture. \"\nIn fact, that is exactly what the new season hopes to deliver . Through the program, \"the listeners will see the characteristics of the Chinese people: save and tenacity ,\" Chen told Xinhua Internet.\n,,. (2,10)", "id": "middle5239.txt"}
