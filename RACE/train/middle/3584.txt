Salads are much liked and are served all year round. Many Americans are trying to keep down their weight. This is shown in menus offering \"low calorie \" or \"weight watchers\" meals. In markets, one can find \"No Cal\" drinks (meaning without calories) such as cola.\nMany Americans drink coffee or tea with their meal. If a waiter in an American restaurant asks \"Now or later?\", what he means is \"Do you want coffee with your meal or later?\" When eating out in the USA, we can ask for tea, milk, beer, and so on, if we prefer these to coffee. American restaurants cannot serve beer, wine, or liquor unless they are licensed to do so.\nThe main dish in American meals is usually meat, chicken or fish, but more than one of these is hardly served at the same meal.\nMost Americans eat quickly during the day--that is, breakfast and lunch--unless it is a social, business, or family situation. The evening meal, however, is usually a family time. Racing through daytime meals is part of the \"American pace\" of life, for working hours are considered important.\nThe nationwide fast-food restaurants are suitable for the ways of American eating. The standard  products, of nearly the same price, are served quickly, and taste the same whether bought in New York City or in Los Angeles.\nMcDonald's is a popular restaurant. It offers many choices of hamburgers, French fries and \"cokes\". These foods are rich in fats, sugar and salt. Often, they are the major meal of the day of many young working people.", "id": "middle3584.txt"}
