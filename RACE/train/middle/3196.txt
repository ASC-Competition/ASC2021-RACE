Do you have any pity on them who are so poor and lonely or do you just feel afraid of their terrible shapes? As one of the most special groups, disabled people's living conditions -- not only their material   conditions, but their mental   world -- really need improvement.\nThe treatment for disabled people should go like this: First, don't look down upon them. Don't be afraid of looking at the terrible shapes of the disabled. Try to treat them _ . Because they are a part of the society  ,we cant discard   them. The second is to help them as much as we could. If you can be a volunteer and do some work for the disabled people, that would be very nice. That does help not only to the disabled people but also to yourself because you will feel good after your kind action.\nIf every one of us gives a little love, the world will become a beautiful wonderland!", "id": "middle3196.txt"}
