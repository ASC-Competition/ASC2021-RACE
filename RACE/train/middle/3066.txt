The look on his face said that one of us had done something wrong.\n\"Which one of you did this?\"\nWe all looked down at the step. There was child's handwriting in chalk there. I was very frightened. I hope no one could see it. Would he guess it was me? I was so scared. When he asked me, I lied, \"Not me, dad.\" The other denied  it as well. Of course, we all knew that one of us must have done it. But as the youngest and smallest of the three, I just couldn't find courage to tell the truth.\nTo find out who had written on the step, Father gave us each a piece of paper and a pencil. \"I want each of you to write exactly what you see on the step.\" I tried my best to write the words differently. I didn't want dad to be able to tell it was me.\nHe gathered up our paper and looked at them. \"Since none of you will say yes, then I will punish you all.\" I stood there and said nothing. The last thing I wanted was for Dad to punish me!\n\"I did it.\" My sister walked forward and said she had done something she hadn't. she was punished for a month.\nWe didn't talk about that day for many years. Not until we were all older and I knew it was safe to finally tell my dad it was really me. I always felt sorry because of it. That was the last time I let anyone _ for me. I told myself, \"One must see to what he or she has done.\"", "id": "middle3066.txt"}
