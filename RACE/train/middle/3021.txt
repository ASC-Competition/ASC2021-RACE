He loved him very much. Every day after work the man would come home and play with the little boy.\nWhen the man came home from work one night, he found that he had some extra work to do. And he wasn't able to play with his little son. He wanted to give the boy something to keep him busy. So, looking around his study, he saw a magazine with a large map of the world on the cover. He got an idea. He patiently tore the map up into pieces. Then he led his son into the dining room and spread the pieces on the table. He explained to the boy that it was a map of the world. He told the boy to put it back together and they could play together when he finished. Surely this could keep the child busy for hours, he thought.\nAfter about thirty minutes, the boy came to the man and said, \"Okay, it's finished, Dad. Can we play now?\"\nThe man was surprised, saying, \"That's amazing! How did you do that?\" The boy said, \"It was easy. On the back of the page was a picture of a man. When I put the man together, the whole world appeared completely.\"", "id": "middle3021.txt"}
