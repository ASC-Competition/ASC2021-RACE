Kids were afraid to go into his yard to pick apples.\nOne day, 12-year-old Janet and her friend Amy had to walk past Mr. Dawson' s house. When Janet saw him outside, she suggested they cross the street and walk on the other side. But Amy said they didn't need to.\nWhen Mr. Dawson saw Amy, he smiled and said: \" Hello, Amy! I see you have a new friend with you today.\" Amy smiled back. Mr. Dawson was friendly and gave them each a fresh apple.\nLater, Janet asked Amy: \" Everyone says he is the most unwelcoming  person in town. Why was he kind to us?\" Amy explained that when she first walked past his house, she was also afraid of him. But she pretended  there was an invisible  smile on his face and started talking to him. At first she only said \"hello\" but then began talking to him more every time she saw him.\n\"An invisible smile?\" Janet was puzzled  . \"Yes,\" answered Amy. \"My grandma told me to try that. She says smiles can spread. So if we keep trying to smile at someone, sooner or later they will smile back.\"\nAmy's grandma realized most people can't refuse  to smile at a friendly face.", "id": "middle5715.txt"}
