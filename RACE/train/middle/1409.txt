She is a lovely girl with two big, beautiful eyes. But she always hides them behind a pair of black glasses.\nOne day, though, I nearly ended our friendship. I remember that day clearly. We were sitting in class. The teacher was giving us our results for a Chinese test. I had done badly. I felt so sad that I wouldn't talk to anyone. At lunchtime, I even stayed in the classroom alone. Suddenly, I heard a voice. It was Vanilla. \"You look very unhappy,\" she said. \"What's wrong?\" I looked up at her, but said nothing. I knew Vallina had got a good mark in the test. I thought she was making fun of me. I stayed silent , but Vallina didn't go away. She kept asking me questions: \"Is it because of the exam? Do you want me to show you the right answers?\" I looked away from her. When I looked up again, Vanilla had gone. And so had my exam paper! I didn't know what to do. I looked everywhere for me paper, but couldn't find it.\nIn the afternoon, Vanilla came up to my desk and gave me my exam paper back. I looked at it and got a big surprise. Vanilla had written the right answer next to every one of my mistakes. My face went red. Vanilla had been trying to help me all along. How mean I had been to her when she was being so nice. I wanted to hug  her, but all I did was to hold her hands and say, \"Thank you.\" That afternoon, Vanilla and I walked home together. I felt so happy that I had to thank her again. We were still best friends.", "id": "middle1409.txt"}
