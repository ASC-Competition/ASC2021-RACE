Years ago, that was my dad. His father died when he was 10, and as the oldest of five, he had to take care of his brothers and sisters. When his mother remarried, my dad had to leave home. With few choices, he joined the army, and worked as hard as he could for a job, a nice house, and a family. Having a dad like him has made me different from other people; with his help and advice, I set and meet my goals.\nWhen I wanted to play basketball, my dad said, \"Don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't do.\" People thought I was too small to play, but he let me know I could. Looking back now, I know why my dad said this to me: it was something his father and mother never told him.\nTime flew by. It was time for me to look for a job. A department store offered me a job as cart assistant. For the whole day, I pushed shopping carts. It was so cold that I couldn't move my hands. But my dad wouldn't let me give up, even though I wanted to. He kept saying it would get better, and he was right. I've worked there for a year now and I do much more than just push carts.\nMy dad helped me grow into the person I'm becoming. When I was younger, I was small. The other boys called me \" _ Nicky\". I hated it. I went to my dad for a help. He encouraged me and helped me make an exercise plan and I got to work.\nIn my life, there are different roads. My dad helped me get on the one I continue on today. I know I am just at the beginning. There will be difficulties. But there will always be my dad. Even when he is not physically here for me, his words won't leave my mind.", "id": "middle6228.txt"}
