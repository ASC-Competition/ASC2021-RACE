Have you ever seen a painting in a tree hole? Now you can see many paintings in tree holes on a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province. What's up?\nThese paintings are painted by Wang Yue, 23, a college student at Dalian Polytechnic University. Wang describes her tree hole paintings as \"a beautiful journey\" through which she adds fun to her hometown.\n\"When I saw that the trees by the roadside had lost all their leaves, the ugly tree holes became obvious ,\" she said.\n\"I thought if I could paint some interesting scenes in these holes they might add some color to the city. \"\nBut Wang was worried that the pigments  in her watercolors could hurt the trees. After asking environmental specialists and getting permission from city officials, Wang gathered her color palette , brushes and other things to get to work.\n\"Painting on a tree hole is not as easy as painting on a canvas . I had to think about the shapes and sizes of the tree holes and adjust my designs accordingly,\" she said. \"Before I began, I also had to clean off the dust from the tree holes first.\"\n\"I was glad to let people see life's beauty. I hope more artists can join me in painting the tree holes,\" Wang said.", "id": "middle7129.txt"}
