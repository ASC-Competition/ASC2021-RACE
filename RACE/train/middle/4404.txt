It talks about different ways of communicating like chatting on line, sending e-mails, sending different kinds of messages and keeping an online diary.\nThe article says that people nowadays send e-mails at least once a day. I don't agree with this because I send e-mail only twice a week. However, I do check my e-mail once a day. I like receiving e-mails.\nAbout chatting online, the article says that chatting on line is becoming more and more popular among teenagers. I think this is true. Whenever I arrive at home, I turn on my computer and log on  to chat online with my friends. I prefer chatting online to calling a friend, because I can chat with many friends at the same time.\nBut I like using mobile phones. When I do not have my computer with me I can send short massages to my friends. I also like keeping in touch with them in this way.\nI keep an online diary four times a week. I like telling others what has happened to me.\nI think I am one of the people living in the e-age. I can live without computers or mobile phones.\nWhat about you? Can you live without computers or mobile phones?\nPosted 6:15 pm", "id": "middle4404.txt"}
