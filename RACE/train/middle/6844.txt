Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed.\nWhy does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels   at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene.\nWhen my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals   and pour thick flour   over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \"snow\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \"snow\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair!\nThese days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat   but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \"everyday\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure   to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them.", "id": "middle6844.txt"}
