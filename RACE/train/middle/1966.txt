As he watched the cars go by, he noticed that many of them were new Beta 400s and most of them were yellow.\nThe following week, Mr. Perkin bought a new bright yellow Beta 400s. He was very pleased with it, and drove to work in it the next day. He was even more pleased with his new car, when he saw all the other Beta 400s, in front, behind, and on both sides of him.\nMr. Perkin parked his car near his office, and walked the rest of the way. But when he came back at five o'clock, there were so many bright yellow Beta 400s that Mr. Perkin didn't know which car was his. He tried his key in some of the cars, but people gave him a strange look which he didn't like, so he stopped.\nPoor Mr. Perkin had to wait nearly two hours until there was only one yellow Beta 400S left.", "id": "middle1966.txt"}
