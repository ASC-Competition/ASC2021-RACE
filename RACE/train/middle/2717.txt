She went to many different record companies. But she was always _ for looking too young and small.\n\"I'd never had such difficulties before,\" Chang said. But Chang's talent was finally accepted in 2002. When she got a piece of work, she cried.\nShe soon became a star. Her first albumOver the Rainbowsold very well. She won many awards.\n\"You wouldn't believe such a beautiful voice could come from such a small body,\" said one musician after hearing Chang sing. \"She has a special voice. You can't forget it.\"\nBut the 25-year-old girl has other talents too. Chang is also an actress. She has played a role in the popular TV plays, My MVP ValentineandAt Dolphin Bay. Many people remember her common-girl parts in the plays. But acting is difficult. Chang once acted so badly that she was nearly fired  . Another time it took her 27 tries to get a scene   right.\n\"I cried when I got back home,\" Chang said. \"But I knew that I wouldn't always fail. You only fail when you give up.\"\nNow with four albums behind her -Over the Rainbow, Aurora, Pandoraand Flower in the Wonderland, it's clear that Chang and music were made for each other. As she sings in one song, \"I have a pair of invisible wings  . They fly me to the skies and give me hope.\"", "id": "middle2717.txt"}
