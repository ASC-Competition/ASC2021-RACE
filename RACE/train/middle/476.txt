As he was very busy then, the letter lay on his desk till tea-time. He opened it and a 10-pound note( ) fell out onto the desk. Within the note was a letter which said:\nDear sir:\nIn 1935 I got engaged( ). But unfortunately I lost my job. At the time a lot of people were out of work. Six months later I got a job again, but of course I was very short of money. I came to your shop to buy a wedding ring( ). The assistant took out some rings for me to look at, but she was called away for a moment, and I put one of the rings in my pocket. When she came back, I said I didn't know the size of my girl's finger. So I left the shop without buying a ring. My wife died a short while ago and the fact that I never paid for the ring has been heavy in my heart all these years. At that time, the ring cost 2 pounds so I think it is 10 pounds at today's price and I'm sending 10 pounds.\nYours truly,\nA customer ( )", "id": "middle476.txt"}
