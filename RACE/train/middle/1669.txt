A baby giraffe is born 10 feet high and usually lands on its back. Within seconds it rolls over its legs under its body. Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality of life.\nIn his book, A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson.\nThe mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look.

She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling .\nWhen it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important.

She wants it to remember how it got up.
