I thought my life would be full of happiness and knowledge. But my life in the university is not as what I had expected. Then I became lazy and silent, even puzzled  . I don't know what my future would be like.\nFour years in the university is only a short period. And a half of it has passed already. This year, many people, such as my parents and my friends, asked me what I wanted to do and they all told me to make a plan for my life with their thought. I don't want to take their advice. I want my own style. So I think carefully.\nI have been a young volunteer for five years. It has been a happy time and it is a big thing for me. Then I have a dream to join the University Student Volunteer Go West Program. I think I can be a teacher in the west. I would like to devote my life to helping the children there. I want to make the world a better place for them. To make it come true, I will work harder in the next two years. There is an old saying \"Where there is a will, there is a way\". I think my dream will come true in the near future.\nAt last, I want to say to everybody, \"Try your best to realize your dreams, no matter how big or small they are. The path to dream may not be smooth and wide. Even there are some difficulties you will face. But hold on to the end, you can find there is no greater happiness than making our dream come true.\"", "id": "middle6885.txt"}
