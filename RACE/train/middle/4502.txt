Adam is a MBA student at Harvard University. He studies long hours, gets very little sleep and as a result, he drinks a lot of coffee---anywhere from five to six cups a day. Recently, Adam felt that drinking thus much coffee was making it hard for him to sleep at all. He also began having problems with his concentration , and complained of stomachaches. Adam's doctor made this suggestions: stop drinking coffee altogether.\nWhen Adam got up on October 3, he began his day without his morning coffee. By 11:00 a.m., Adam was in a terrible mood  . He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on?\nCaffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts  energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption  often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a \"coffee headache\", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus.\nThe good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache. So, if Adam can wait, in less than a week, he may be feeling much better.", "id": "middle4502.txt"}
