Nowadays, Chinese zodiac animals have worldwide fame and are increasingly popular among western people.\nThe zodiac is an important part of Chinese culture. People believe that the characteristics of a zodiac animal influence the personality of every person born in that year. For example, people born in the Year of the Tiger are considered powerful and brave.\nZodiac animals also have some social functions. When people think it is not proper to ask: \"How old are you\", they may change their question to \"What is your zodiac animal?\" With this question, you can figure out roughly which year someone was born and the person's age.\nZodiac animals are not special to China.

According to legend, the Jade Emperor invited all the animals to join him for Chinese New Year. Only 12 animals went to see him. As a reward he named a year after each one in the order they arrived.
