But you need to keep your mind stable   in order to make sure you are safe.

If you live quite some floors above in your building, try to find a place near a bulky  object such as a bed. Curl up   and sit on the floor and make sure you are not near a window, fireplace, gas stove and so on. Remember don't use lifts or escalators.\nSome people say you should stand on a doorway. That is not true. If the doorway jambs   are weak, they might fall on you. Also if people want to pass through that door, you may stop them. Leave all doorways free.\nAnother important thing to keep in mind is that you mustn't climb down the stairs during an Earthquake.
