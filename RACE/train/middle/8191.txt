My parents are both businessmen and they come home every two weeks. Because they don't spend much time with me, they always feel guilty* and will buy me many expensive things and let me do whatever I want. My grandparents never let me do any chores because they want me to do my schoolwork.\nI used to take everything for granted*. I never said \"thank you\" to people. As time went by, I found that my classmates didn't like me and my best friends left me. one day, I asked Leo, who used to be one of my best friends. He said that I was selfish, rude* and bad-tempered*. \"No one wants to make friends with a person who always receives but never gives anything!\" he said. I was shocked* at his words. \"Oh, no! Please don't leave me. I need friends! I will be lonely and unhappy without friends!\" I locked myself up in the room and cried. \"I want my friends back. But how?\"\nThen I noticed that all the popular kids in the class friendly to others. They always smile and say \"thank you\" to others. They do whatever they can to help when others are in trouble. Other kids like them and always play with them. \"I need to change! I will get my friends back,\" I said to myself. From then on, I started to change myself. I learned to say \"thank you\" to others. I smiled and volunteered to help other kids. I tried to be as nice as I could.\n, I found that other kids liked to talk with me and they would ask me to play with them and even told me their secrets. My friends came back to me again.\nNow I have more friends than I used to do and I am happier than I used to be.", "id": "middle8191.txt"}
