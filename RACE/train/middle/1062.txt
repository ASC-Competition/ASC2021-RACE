I went to Chicago and knocked at the door of every station. But unluckily, I was refused every time.\nAt one station, a kind lady told me that big stations wouldn't hire  a person without any experience and suggested that I try my luck at smaller stations. Following her advice, I went back to Dixon, where I had grown up. There were no such jobs in Dixon, and my father said a newly-opened store wanted a local athlete to work for it. I wanted this job, but I was refused again.\n\"Everything happens for the best,\" Mom reminded me. Dad offered me the car to look for a job. I tried WOC Radio in Davenport, Iowa. The program director, Peter MacArthur, told me they had already hired an announcer.\nAs I left his office, I felt so frustrated. \"How can I become a sports announcer if I can't get a job in a radio station?\" I asked aloud.\nWhile I was waiting for the elevator, I heard someone calling. It was MacArthur. \"What was that you said about sports? Do you know anything about football?\" Then he asked me to have a try. He was pleased with my performance, and he offered me a chance to work there.\nOn my way home, I thought of my mother's words: \"If you carry on, one day something good will happen. Something wouldn't have happened if without the failure before.\"", "id": "middle1062.txt"}
