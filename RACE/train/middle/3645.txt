He is busy all the time. But when he takes his holidays, he always goes traveling and has been to about thirty countries. One summer he went to visit Moscow. There he heard the workers were paid much less than those in his countries. And most factories couldn't work because they were short of   money. He thought he would save much money if he invested   in a factory there. The Russians knew it and warmly met him and he was invited to visit a modern factory. He went to the workplaces, watched carefully how the machines worked. The workers worked hard when he went in.\nSoon it was time to have lunch. Mr. Brown went in the dining -room. Meat, eggs, milk and bread could be bough there. It seemed that they weren't short of anything. Mr. Brown came up to an old worker and sat down next to him.\nAre you satisfied with your life, sir? Asked Mr. Brown.\n\"Of course,\" the worker answered and went on drinking.\n\"What do you have now?\"\n\"I live in beautiful villa   ,\" answered the man. \"I have a new fridge, a new color television and I drive a new car to my factory.\"\n\"What's your next wish, then?\"\n\"To buy a pair of strong shoes!\"", "id": "middle3645.txt"}
