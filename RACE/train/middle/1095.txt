He has four friends. They are Ben, Eric, Peter and Andy. But they are all very different. Nick is confident and kind. He is also a good listener. All of his friends like to talk to him about their problems. This is his best quality. Ben is the quietest friend of them. He is not energetic and active like Eric, or outgoing like Peter. But he is so patient and fair. When they have an argument, Ben is always there to listen to everyone and make sure that everybody stays friends. Andy is very clever and hard-working.
