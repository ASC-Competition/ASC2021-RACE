One night they camped in an open air with a starry sky above. The elder villager, following the tradition passed down from ancestors, took out three blocks  of salt and threw them into the campfire to tell the change of weather in the mountains.\nAll people waited for the old man's \"weather report\": if the salt in the fire produced crackling sound , they would have good weather; if no sound was produced, it then meant the good weather would soon end and a storm would come at any moment.\nThe elder villager looked serious. The salt in the campfire made no sound at all. He urged the whole team to set out immediately. A young man in the group thought it absurdly superstitious  to \"forecast the weather by using salt\".\nIt was not until the next afternoon, the weather suddenly changed, with cold winds blowing and a snowstorm coming. In fact, the method used by the elder man could be well explained by modern science: whether or not salt produces sound in campfire depends on air humidity .That is to say, when a snowstorm _ , lead to high humidity, the salt blocks will not produce any sound in fire.\nYoung people often don't mind the philosophy  of the old, regarding their ideas as out date and useless. To be honest, however, some beliefs in life are just like salt blocks that are distilled  from the sea: old as they are, they remain crystals , and carry with them deep memories of the sea.\n,.", "id": "middle3988.txt"}
