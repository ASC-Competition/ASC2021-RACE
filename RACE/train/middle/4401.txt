They were made of lamb skin, soft and warm and very strong. Until then, he had worn cheaper man-made material. These gloves never lasted longer than three years. He first decided to buy the expensive gloves, because they would make him feel nice in front of others.  George never let a drop of water or rain touch his expensive gloves, so they looked new. Losing this favourite thing was almost like losing a child to him. Bad luck! George lost his expensive gloves on New Year's Day....\nBack home, George was at a loss. In deep winter, he could not do without a pair of gloves. If he bought cheap ones again, he would have to replace   them very soon. If he bought a new leather pair, it would cost $50 now. He was sad that people no longer returned things they found on the road.\nAfter the holiday, poor George decided to buy another leather pair. Before boarding the subway, he went into Value Mart again to see if his gloves had been returned to the Lost and Found Office . \"What colour are they?\" the woman in the office asked again. \"Black,\" he gave the same answer.\nShe looked into her drawer and drew out a pair of men's leather gloves. \"Are they?\" \"Yes! Those are mine!\"\nGeorge explained, with great joy in his eyes.", "id": "middle4401.txt"}
