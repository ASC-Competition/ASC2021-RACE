We live in a country with hundreds of excellent universities. So the first question is: what's going to work for me?\"\n\"When it was time to prepare for picking schools, nobody around me believed I could get into Xiamen University. But through hard work I finally made it,\" she continued. \"So, my second piece of advice is: believe in yourself, no matter what other people might say. Once your goal is set, you only need to try your best to make it come true.\"\n\"The last piece of advice is not to be worried even if your dreams don't come true. As I've said above, there are so many good universities out there. So it's important for everybody to understand that you can always find a university that gives you a great education.\"", "id": "middle7053.txt"}
