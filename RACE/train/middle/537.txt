I went to the biggest store in town, which sold all kinds of computers. There were so many computers there that I didn't know how to choose a right one.\n\"Hi! What can I do for you?\" A young man greeted me with a sweet smile. He looked like not a salesman but a student like me. I sensed a strange feeling -- as if I had met him before. He began patiently showing me each model. With his help, I decided to buy one computer with enough functions at a very low price. I enjoyed this shopping experience because of his smile. A few months later, something was wrong with my computer. I went back to the store to have it fixed. When I arrived there, what I saw was still his smile. As soon as I told him my problem, he comforted me immediately and tried his best to solve the problem for me. I was quite grateful for his sweet smile and good service.\nWhen I went back to school, his smile often appeared in my mind. I don't know whether we'll meet each other again, but his sweet smile will stay there in my memory and deep in my heart. Smiling is the most peaceful language in the daily life.", "id": "middle537.txt"}
