You would never rob   a bank or pick someone's pocket. But you may be another kind of thief.\nIf you have ever bought a disc for 15 yuan or less, then you have helped to rob artists or musicians of their intellectual properly rights  .\nLast Thursday was World Intellectual Property Day. Activities to tell people about intellectual property rights were held around the country.\nIntellectual property includes inventions, literary   and artistic works, names, and pictures. They are of little value   if they are not read, seen and used.\nWhile the cost of copying discs is very small, authors, singers and actors have to spend a lot of money and time making a new product. That's why they have the right to make money from their work.\nSo buying pirated   music of Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai is like stealing from them, paying them no respect for their hard work.\nIf Jay Chou cannot make money from his work, he may not make anything else. But those who make pirated goods are becoming rich without doing any hard work.\nThe authors should ask for a fair price for their work. Earlier this year there was much talk about how much KTV clubs should pay the music companies for using their songs.\nThe copyright fee   also should be fair to the users. That's good for the music's popularity and society as well.", "id": "middle3622.txt"}
