Mum, Dad and I went to Thailand last week. We had a great time!\nWe arrived at the airport early on Friday morning. I chose a window seat on the plane. I could see the clouds clearly from the window. They looked soft and shiny. Four hours later, we landed in Thailand.\nWe stayed at a hotel in Pattaya on our first day. We went to the beach. We played different water sports there. We had so much fun! We were tired when we got back to the hotel.\nOn the next day, we went to Bangkok. We visited two temples there. They looked like golden bells with pointed tops. We took some photos outside the temples and had a walk in the gardens. In the evening, we had dinner at a restaurant next to a lake. The food was very _ so I kept drinking cold water!\nOn the last day, we hung out at a shopping mall. Mum bought a beautiful tea set. Dad bought some T-shirts and I bought some dried mangoes  . We went to the airport after lunch. I was lucky because I got a window seat again. This time I could see the beautiful sunset  .\nWe enjoyed the trip very much. I hope we will go on another trip again soon.\nLove\nPolly", "id": "middle6242.txt"}
