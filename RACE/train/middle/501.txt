The following are the ways for studying.\nThe best time for reading is morning, because in the morning, the air is fresh and the mind is clear. For that reason, we can get good results.\nIn studying we must have patience. If we have not known a text well, we must read it again. We should not read the next one till we have learned the first one.\nWhen we are studying, we must put our hearts into the book, or we can get nothing from the book while we are reading.\nWe must always ask \" why\" . If it is not well understood, write it down and ask our teachers or our parents, brothers or friends. In any possible way, we must know it completely and what we've learned can be used well and made better.\nThough there are many ways for studying, the above mentioned will be quite enough if we can keep them in heart and do so.", "id": "middle501.txt"}
