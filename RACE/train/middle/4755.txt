Here is my advice.\n*Make a picture for them. Whether with pencils or paints, it will be a treasure  to them forever.\n*Write a letter to them. Take your time to put your thoughts in _ .\n*keep your room clean! Though it's a kind of the chore, it shows mom and dad that care.\n*Cook them a dinner! It can be some rice , some cheese or some hot dogs; it can give them a break.\n*tell them that you love them very often. Your love can make them feel warm and proud.\n*Never tell a lie  to them. Probably the biggest way to show them you love them is, never to lie. This shows them that you not only love them, but also believe in and respect  them.\n*Create time to be with them. Watch a film with your mom once in a while, or go to a sports match with your dad once in a while just to show them how much you care and want to close with them.\n*If you do something wrong, apologize  and explain it! They will know you are sorry. You could do something for them to show you want to make it up to them. Just saying sorry can really show how much you love them.\nYours ,\nAgony Aunt", "id": "middle4755.txt"}
