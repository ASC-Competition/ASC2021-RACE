And we often ask for more than we need. Life is a gift. Today, before you complain about the taste of your food,think of those who have nothing to eat. Before you complain about life,think of some ones who went to heaven too early. Before you complain about your old house, think of the people who are living in the streets. And when you are tired and complain about your job, think of those who have no jobs.\nIn a word, enjoy the things you have and don't forget your past.\n,.", "id": "middle8155.txt"}
