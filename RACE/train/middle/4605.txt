The King of England wanted to control Scotland. He had a strong army so it was difficult for the Scots to fight. They lost many times. King Robert of Scotland had to run from the English army.\nOne rainy day, King Robert lay in a cave  . He thought that he was not good enough to be a king. He was so worried that he didn't even see a spider near him. He looked up when he saw the spider climbing. It was trying to climb up to its web at the top of the cave but it fell down.\n\"How sad!\" thought King Robert. \"The spider is like me. It's not strong enough.\"\nHe watched while the spider tried again. It fell down a second time.\n\"Be careful little spider, or you might die,\" he said. \"Life is so hard. You'll never\nget back to your web.\" But the spider tried again and again. King Robert watched while it slowly climbed back to its web. After an hour, the spider got to the web.\n\"You are such a great spider,\" he said. \"If you can keep trying, I can too. I must carry on fighting. I won't let the English win.\" Then his army grew strong and they stopped the English army successfully.", "id": "middle4605.txt"}
