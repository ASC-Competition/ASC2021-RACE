Their job was to do the cleaning. It was not a difficult job, but sometimes it was a little dangerous, because they had to walk below where workmen were working. Often these workmen dropped something from the top of the house many meters high to the ground.\nOne morning Joe was working near the house with a cigarette behind one of his ears. Suddenly somebody on the top shouted, \"Look out!\" But Joe did not \"look out\". He looked up. And as he did so, a long knife missed Joe's head, but it cut off one of his ears. At once he put his hand to one side of his head and cried out, \"I've lost an ear. Help! Help!\"\nJeff ran up to help his friend. \"Look for my ear,\" Joe told him. \"It must be on the ground somewhere.\" Jeff looked everywhere for the missing ear. At last he found an ear on the ground. He picked it up and carried it to Joe. \"Here you are,\" he said, \"I've found it.\" Joe looked at it. \"No, that's not my ear.\" he said, \"Mine had a cigarette behind it.\"", "id": "middle2130.txt"}
