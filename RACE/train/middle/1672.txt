His two daughters, aged four and six, were with him.\nSuddenly, a sick man fell down on the platform  . The man, 20-year-old Cameron Hollopeter, got up, but then fell again--this time, onto the track between the two rails  . A train was coming into the station. It was a frightening moment.\nBut Mr Autrey wasn't frightened. He looked at the man and the space that the man was in. It was about half a meter deep. And he thought, \"The train is going to travel over this man. If he tries to get up, the train will kill him. But if he lies on the ground and doesn't move, he'll be OK.\" So he got an idea.\nHe jumped down and kept Mr Hollopeter down on the ground. The train driver saw them. He was terrified, but he couldn't stop in time. The train traveled over the two men before it stopped.\nThe people on the platform were surprised. When Mr Autrey heard them screaming, he shouted, \"We're OK down here, but I've got two daughters up there. Let them know their father is OK.\"\nIn an interview on a TV show, Mr Autrey said, \"The only thing that happened to me was my blue hat got dirty.\"", "id": "middle1672.txt"}
