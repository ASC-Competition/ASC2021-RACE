But some others still don't want to start packing. I once again ask for your attention as we will have summer camps for the new students. There is much work to be done in packing and cleaning-up,especially during exam week.\nEach student will get a task list and each task has a deadline .The dorm teachers will work with each student each night to make sure you are getting the tasks done on time. It would be helpful if your parents encourage you to do a little packing and cleaning from now on. It means you can take the posters off the wall,pack up winter clothes,return all borrowed books to the library,etc. Spending twenty minutes a day on your tasks will make the last week of the term very easy,and you can spend more time on the important preparation for exams. If you plan to travel home,I'd like to remind you to take some of your _ with you.\nThe coming weekend is a\"closed weekend\".During that time no one is allowed to leave school. After packing we need to prepare the dorms for moving out,and store students' large belongings.\nThe last exam is on Thursday and all students leave after their exam. The dorm will remain open until 5 p. m. on Friday for those students that could not get a ride or flight. Please let us know if you need transportation to the airport.\nThank you again for all your attention during the last,busy month of school. As always,you,welcome to call or email me with any questions.\nPeter Margio\nDirector of Campus Life\n453-757-2630\npmargioC baylinschool. com", "id": "middle5179.txt"}
