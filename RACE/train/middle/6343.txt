It means that real-life people, not actors, are followed and filmed in a real situation, or game.\nReality TV is very popular in the UK. At their best, these programmes give us a good look into the lives of different people in Britain. At their worse, they are a very cheap way to make programmes and sometimes involve people behaving very badly.\nHere's a selection of some of the UK's reality shows.\nShattered\nA group of young people live in a house for a week and must stay awake. Each day there are tests to see how well they can work even though they are totally tired out. They must leave the house if they fall asleep. Viewers vote on those who stay in the house and text their comments   every day.\nCome to Dine with Me\nEach week four people prepare dinner in their homes for the other competitors. Each competitor then gives the cook a grade out of 10 for the food and entertainment  . The winner gets a $1,000 cash prize. Sometimes the food is terrible and the competitors are very rude to each other.\nWorld's Strictest Parents\nBadly-behaved British teens are sent abroad to live with a super strict family for a week. The teenagers have to follow the rules of their host family and go to the local school. After seven days the teenagers return home and their parents tell us if their behaviour is better. There is often a lot of crying and shouting in this show but it can be pretty funny too.", "id": "middle6343.txt"}
