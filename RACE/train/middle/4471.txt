On Christmas Eve when Paul came out of his office, a street urchin   was walking around the shining car. \"Is this your car, sir?\" he asked.\nPaul answered, \"Yes, my brother gave it to me for Christmas.\" The boy was surprised, \"You mean your brother gave it to you and it did cost you nothing? Sir, I wish...\" He hesitated . Paul thought of course he knew what the boy wanted, but what the boy said surprised him greatly. \"I wish, \" the boy went on, \"that I could be a brother like that. \" Paul looked at the boy in surprise, and then he said again, \"Would you like to take a ride in my car?\" \"Oh yes, I'd love to.\" The boy answered.\nAfter a short ride, the boy turned with his eyes shining and said, \"Sir, would you mind driving in front of my house?\"\nPaul smiled a little. He thought he know what the boy wanted, He wanted to show his neighbors that he could ride home in a big car. But Paul was wrong again. \"Will you stop where those two steps are?\" the boy asked.\nHe ran up to the steps. Then in a short while Paul heard him coming back, but he was not coming fast. He Was carrying his little crippled   brother. He sat down on the step and pointed to the car.\n\"There he is, Buddy, just like I told you upstairs. His brother gave it to him for Christmas and it didn't cost him a cent . And some day I'm going to give you one just like it... then you can see for yourself all the nice things in the Christmas window- that I've been trying to tell you about.\"\nPaul got out and lifted the boy to the front seat of his car. The shining-eyed elder brother climbed in beside him and the three began an unforgettable holiday ride.[:Zxxk.Com]", "id": "middle4471.txt"}
