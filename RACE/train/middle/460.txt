But he was out of luck this summer.\nHe went to an old temple on a high mountain by himself. On his way there it suddenly began to rain heavily and he hurried to go down the mountain. When he got to the foot of the mountain, he found the wooden bridge was under the water, so he had to spend the rainy night in a broken farmhouse. He was so hungry that he hardly fell asleep.\nThe next morning the rain stopped and he found the bridge was damaged. He saw the river was not too deep and tried to swim across it. In the middle of the river the water nearly washed him away. Luckily , two farmers saved him, but he lost his bag. They gave him some food and dry clothes. He thanked them and went to the nearest town to call up his parents.\nAt the end of the street, Dick found a small hotel and went in. He asked the price for a room.\n\"A room on the first floor is twenty dollars, on the second floor, fifteen dollars and on the third, ten dollars,\" answered the owner.\nThe young man had only eight dollars in all his pockets. He said thanks and was leaving. The owner asked, \"Don't you like our hotel?\"\n\"Yes, it's good,\" said Dick, \"but it's not tall enough!\"", "id": "middle460.txt"}
