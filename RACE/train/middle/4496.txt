Some of them even lose their lives for it. Money does have its most useful effect on the poor,but once a person has a rich life,a lot more money doesn't mean more happiness.\nIf money was everything,all millionaires would have true love, true friendship,good health and a long life. However,this is not always true.\nNothing else is more pleasant than the three words which are \"I love you\". But can love be bought?I'm afraid not. Love means to give,not to take. To every person,health and long life are probably the most precious things.
