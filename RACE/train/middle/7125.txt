I am 10 years old and I live in Cairo, Egypt. It's the capital of my country and is the largest city in all of Africa. Egypt is very dry and hot. Most of it is covered with desert, so most of our people live near the Nile River.\nKids go to primary school from ages 6-12. I learn cooking, sewing and embroidery . Only half of the kids in primary school go to general school. (I hope to go there.) In the first two years we learn reading, writing and math. In the third year of school we learn science and Quran .\nSome popular games are marbles  and hide and seek. The most popular sport in my country is soccer. To have fun, we also visit markets to _ things and to see our friends.\nI get around by taking the train. Sometimes when my family goes on vacation we take a boat, plane, or a camel. I like to visit the Great Pyramids. Near the pyramids there stands the Sphinx . It used to be facing open desert but now lots of buildings are in Egypt, and it is just facing buildings.\nWell, I had better rap things up, bye!", "id": "middle7125.txt"}
