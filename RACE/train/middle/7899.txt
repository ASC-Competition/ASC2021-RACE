It influences health, intelligence   and feelings. In August, it is very hot and wet in the southern part of the United States. People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March.\nThe weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease  it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August).\nWeather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger.\nLow air pressure  makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a\"perfect weather\"for work and health. People feel best at a tempera- ture of about 64F with 65 percent humidity .\nAre you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason.", "id": "middle7899.txt"}
