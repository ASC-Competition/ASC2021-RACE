There were happy days and _ ldays: some days the sun shone, and some days it didn't.\nIn my twenties, I had a good job. I was strong and happy. Then I married and had a child. In those days, I didn't have much time to think. Every day I was busy and worked very hard. And so, I started to get some white hairs. The summer of my life passed quickly.\nThen the days got shorter. Leaves fell from the trees. My child was a university student, and then an engineer. My home was much quieter.
