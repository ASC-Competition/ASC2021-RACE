Why can't I get smaller?\" It was already a very strange day. and Alice was beginning to think that anything was possible.\nAfter a while she locked the door again, got up and went back to the glass table. She put the key down and she saw a little bottle on the table. Round the neck of the bottle was a piece of paper with the words DRINK ME in large letters.\nBut Alice was a careful girl. \"It can be dangerous to drink out of strange bottles,\" she said. \"What will it do to me?\" She drank a little bit very slowly. The taste was very nice. like chocolate and oranges and hot sweet coffee. and very soon Alice finished the bottle.\n\"What a strange feeling!\" said Alice. \"I think I' m getting smaller and smaller every second.\"\nAnd she was. A few minutes later she was only 25 centimeters high. \"And now,\" she said happily,\n\"I can get through the little door into that beautiful garden.\"\nShe ran at once to the door. When she got there. she remembered that the little gold key was back on the glass table. She ran back to the table for it, but of course, she was now much too small! There was the key, high above her, on top of the table. She tried very hard to climb up the table leg, but she could not do it.\nAt last, tired and unhappy, Alice sat down on the floor and cried. But after a while she spoke to herself angrily.\n\"Come now,\" she said, \"Stop crying at once. What's the use of crying?\" She was a strange child, and often talked to herself like this.\nSoon she saw a little glass box near her on the floor. She opened it and found a very small cake with the words EAT ME on it.[:. . ]\nNothing could surprise Alice now. \"Well, I'II eat it,\" she said. \"If I get taller, I can take the key off the table. And if I get smaller, I can get under the door. _ I'll get into the garden. So it doesn't matter what happens!\" She went on eating, but nothing happened.", "id": "middle3278.txt"}
