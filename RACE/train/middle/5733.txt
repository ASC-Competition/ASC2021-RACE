People in different countries celebrate  their birthdays in different ways. Here are four people from different countries. They will tell us how they celebrate their birthdays in their countries.\nSandy Morrison comes from Madrid . He says happily, \"My twenty-first birthday is on a Saturday, and I'm going to go out with some friends. To wish me a happy birthday, they are going to pull(,)on my ear, once for each year. It is an old custom . Some people pull on the ear just once, but my friends are very traditional .\"\nMr. and Mrs. Sato are from Tokyo. Mr. Sato is going to be sixty tomorrow. In Japan, the sixtieth birthday is called Kanreki---it's the beginning of a new life. The colour red is for a new life, so they always give something red for a sixtieth birthday. Mrs Sato says, \"What am I going to give my husband? I can't say. It's a surprise .\"\nLi Xiaomei from Beijing feels very excited and tells us. \"Tomorrow is my sixteenth birthday. It's a special birthday. So we're going to have a family party. I'm probably going to get some money in 'lucky' envelopes  from my relatives. My mother is going to cook noodles --- noodles are for a long life.\"\nPhillip Evans, from Paris, smiles to us, \"I'm going to be thirty next week, so I'm going to invite three very good friends out to dinner. In France, when you have birthday, you often invite people out. In some countries, I know it's the opposite---- people take you out.\"", "id": "middle5733.txt"}
