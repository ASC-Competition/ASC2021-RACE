Last week the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development   picked the best students in the world. They are Finnish  . The OECD gave a test to 280 000 15-year-old students from more than 40 countries and regions   last year. The OECD wanted to know how well students were doing at school.\nFinnish students were No. 1 in the reading test and second in maths after Hong Kong students. Those from Japan and Finland were top in science. In the problem solving, Finnish students came second to those from South Korea. The test also showed Finland had more top students than the other countries.\nFinns   of your age have done a really good job but don't have a sense of envy. You can learn from them. Most Finnish students make good use of the Internet. Of course not for computer games, but for doing more exercises and finding out more information.\nLibraries are also important.
