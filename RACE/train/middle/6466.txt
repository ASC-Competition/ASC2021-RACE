Her name was Uma. Talking with her made us very happy.\nWhen we arrived in India, we found that our bags weren't on our plane. It was 4 am on Saturday morning. But we were told that we couldn't get our bags until Monday. What could we do? As we stood there thinking, Uma came over. She said, \"Our car will come soon. Come home with me.\"\nWe went out of the airport and got into the small car. It was already crowded with Uma's family who had come to welcome her home.\nAt the house, we showered and rested. They provided us with delicious Indian meals and took us on tours of their city. On Monday morning, their driver took us to the airport, where we were happy to get our bags.\nThe following year, we returned to India, and our first thing was to visit Uma and her family. We have become good friends. Her kindness was a real gift. Everywhere we went, we met kind Indian people. We also did our best to pass on that kindness wherever we went, just as Uma did.", "id": "middle6466.txt"}
