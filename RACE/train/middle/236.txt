All the teachers, parents and students worked together for this program and most of them found it to be a very good one. The headmaster said, \"The idea was not to stop watching TV _ but for the students just to find how much time they watch TV and try to use the time for other things.\" What did the students say about this \"No TV Week\"? One boy said, \"I can't believe I haven't watch TV for a week, but it's been fun doing it.\" A girl student said, \"I'm going to give up all TV program except for 'Our Animal World' and other language-teaching program. I'm really pleased that I have more time to do things like walking and thinking. I enjoy this 'No TV Week' very much...\" But not all the students thought it was good. Here one student Paul said something different, \"I don't like 'No TV Week' because I like watching TV. I have lots of favorite programs and I don't want to miss them. But we have to do it.\"", "id": "middle236.txt"}
