Are there any good ways to give bad news without making people too upset? The following steps might help:\nSay something positive. Try to start or end the conversation with some good news, so that it's not all bad. For example, \" You did very well in the interview, but unfortunately we've given the job to somebody else.\"\nPrepare your listener for the news. Use phrases to introduce what you're going to say, like \"Unfortunately, ...\", \" I'm really sorry , but...\" or \" I'm afraid I've got some bad news.\" This gives the listener time to prepare for what you're going to say.\nTry to give a reason. People like know why things go wrong. Try to explain the decision. If someone doesn't get the job, can you explain why? If you have to cancel an appointment, try to give a reason.\nUse a soft _ of voice. If you're giving someone bad news, try to use a soft, calm voice to make your sound kind. Say things to show you understand, like \"I'm really sorry.\" Or \"I know this must be disappointing.\"", "id": "middle3423.txt"}
