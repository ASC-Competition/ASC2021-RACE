They are very high and Peter can see them from the classroom. After lunch his aunt comes to see his mother and brings a kite to him. It looks like a bird. He wants to fly it but his mother doesn't let him do that.\n\"It's time to go to school,\" says his mother, \"You can fly it after dinner.\"\nThe boy is unhappy, and says goodbye to his aunt and leaves. Now he is in the classroom but he doesn't listen to Miss Black. He only thinks how to fly the kite. Miss Black writes something on the blackboard and then turns to the class.\n\"Name(......) nine things with milk in them, Peter.\" she says.\nThe boy doesn't hear her and still sits there.
