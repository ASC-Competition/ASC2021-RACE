They like playing computer games rather than  cleaning the rooms. But in Australia, Jim and Robert's mother, Mrs.  Black, has good and proper methods to get their children to do housework.\nHere is an example.\n\"Mom, have you worked out next week's chores? Let Jim and me choose the cards.  I can't wait. It's fun! \"\nWhen Robert shouted out, his mother had already put all the cards on their big table. On the cards, there are some words like these, \"sweep the floor, clean your bedroom, help mom cook, wash vegetables, make beds, feed the fish, cut the wood, clean the bathroom\" and many others, Jim and Robert chose two cards for each day from Monday to Friday. Then they would hang them on the weekday task board. Jim likes to clean the bathroom, so he picked up the card \"clean the bathroom\". Robert loves to make the bed so he picked up his favorite card. Jim again picked up \"wash vegetables\" and Robert chose \"feed the fish\". Soon the two boys were happy to take away all the cards.\nTo help the children do chores, their mother thought hard and came up with this idea. Of course, the parents did the chores at weekends and left Jim and Robert two days free.", "id": "middle4934.txt"}
