Can you imagine sitting in class and seeing your dad walk past the door of your classroom and wave his hand at you? In junior high?\nOne girl in our class always made fun of me because my dad was a plumber and hers was a lawyer , and she would say things like, \"Ew, that's gross !\" I must admit I was sometimes embarrassed by what my dad did, especially in my early teens, when the only thing I really cared about was what the other girls thought.\nThe girl lived a few streets away from us, and one winter day---the day her elder sister was getting married---the toilet in their main upstairs bathroom broke and there was water everywhere. Her father, the lawyer called every plumber in the Yellow Page, but nobody would come and because we were having a major snowstorm. Her daughter told him that my father was a plumber, and he called, and my dad went right over---and took me with him.(Maybe he was hoping that the lawyer's daughter would be nicer to me.) My father fixed the toilet, help them clean up everything, and didn't take much time for his trouble. But as we were leaving, he told the girl, \"If I ever need a lawyer, I'll be happy to call your dad.\"\nAs we walked to our car, he said to me, \"Do you believe he didn't know where the main shut-off valve  was? What a dumb ass!\"\nFrom that point on, her dad was known in school as Lawyer Dumb Ass.\nWhen my husband and I bought our house, the first thing my dad showed him was the main shut-off valve.\nI have always been proud to say that I'm a plumber's daughter.", "id": "middle7642.txt"}
