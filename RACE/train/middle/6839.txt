What is it? Many people have a special number that they hope will bring them good luck.\nIn Chinese culture, some numbers are believed to be lucky or unlucky based on the Chinese word that the number sounds similar to.\nFor example, the word for the number 8 sounds similar to the word for \"making a fortune \". So, people consider it a very lucky number. Some people will even spend a lot of money to have 8s in their phone numbers or vehicle license plate   numbers. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics began at 8:08 p.m. on August 8, 2008.\nThe number 9 is also a lucky number because of its connection to the emperors of China.

In Hong Kong, some buildings even skip all floors numbered with 4, such as, 4, 14, 24, 34 and all 40-49 floors. Some buildings also skip the 13th floor, as this is considered an unlucky number in many Christian countries. As a result, a building whose highest floor is 50 may have only 35 physical floors.", "id": "middle6839.txt"}
