Every day he rides to deliver   parcels across his hometown of Philadelphia with his six-month-old cat called MJ always sitting on his shoulders.\nMJ, short for Mary Jane, is different from other cats. She was born in a drawer in Rudy's bedroom on April Fool's day. When she got older, Rudi noticed   that her favorite place to rest was his shoulders, so he decided to train her to work with him.\n\"The first day we crossed one block. The next day we tried two blocks and now we can ride about 25 miles every day. MJ enjoys moving around on my shoulders,\" Rudi said.\nHowever, Rudy hopes to be able to ride 100 miles with MJ in the coming day. \"People are always surprised and excited to watch us. I often hear someone shout, 'Oh, my God, he has a cat on his shoulder! How lovely that is!' MJ is so comfortable on my shoulder and she never hurts me with her claws. We always get on well with each other and have a great time during the work.\" Rudy smiled.\nMJ loves noisy streets of Philadelphia, the only problem is that she is scared of the siren . However, her owner Rudi is always there for her. One day, if you go to Philadelphia and see a postman with a cat on his shoulder, don't be surprised!", "id": "middle4261.txt"}
