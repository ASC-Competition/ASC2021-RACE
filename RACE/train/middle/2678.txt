Do you remember all the names of your friends? Do you have a good memory ?\nA good memory is a great help in learning language . Everybody learns his own language by remembering what he learns when he is a little child. And some children , who live abroad with their parents ,seem to learn two languages more easily . In native school it is not easy to learn a second language because the pupils have so little time for it . and they are busy with other subjects .
