Let's look to see what drinks are popular in the US.\nSports drinks and fruit drinks are quite popular. But there are two main drinks that Americans enjoy most: water and soda. Around 10.9 billion gallons   of water is drunk each year, and 12.8 billion gallons of soda. Soda is the most popular drink. It's fizzy   and enjoyed with friends. Perhaps it is the drink of choice for parties.\nHowever, if you are playing sports, soda is not a good drink. The fizzy and sweet drinks may make you uncomfortable   while exercising. The best drink for sports is water. That's because it has no calories and keeps you fresh during sports. Besides, doctors tell us that drinking water each day is healthy.\nFor many kids, juice or milk are their favorites. These drinks are healthy and give kids  vitamins and energy   during the day. Adults usually choose between tea or coffee.", "id": "middle5320.txt"}
