Do you want to know about my staying in America? Well, to tell you the truth, it is really an eye-opening experience here.\nIn China, I had English classes five times a week since Grade Five. But I didn't know textbook English could be so different from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say \"I'm fine.\" when people say \"How are you?\" But in the USA, I found that people say \"I'm good.\" or \"I'm tired.\"\nOne day, someone greeted   me with \"What's up?\" It made me _ I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.\nSince then, I have learnt more and more differences between Chinese and American cultures. To my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun getting a tan  . In China, girls try every possible way to keep their skin white.\nAmerican students are hard-working like Chinese students. In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard and that's it. But here, a \"good\" student not only gets good grades, but also does a lot for the public. That is to say, they get lots of knowledge at school and learn many life skills from social   work.", "id": "middle1573.txt"}
