It is famous as one of the cleanest countries in the world.\nThe Swiss think that recycling is very important. The government has made laws   which require everyone to recycle. In 1998, the Swiss government passed a law which says that people can not throw away any electronic machines. Instead, people are told to bring old ones, such as televisions, computers and fridges, to special centers when they didn't need them. Many parts of the old machines are reused, and only the parts that can't be used are thrown away. The government also charges  a rubbish bag tax . If people want their rubbish to be collected, they must buy yellow stickers  and put them on their rubbish bags. In 2003, 47% of all rubbish in the cities was recycled. This included 70% of paper, 95%of glass, 71%of plastic bottles and 85--90%of cans. Until recently, people could get a small amount of money when they recycled their bottles. Recycling has become a daily habit for the Swiss.\nEveryone should learn from the Swiss, and our country will be clean like Switzerland.", "id": "middle5392.txt"}
