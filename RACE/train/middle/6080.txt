So knowing how to ask for information politely is important. In English, \"Where are the restrooms?\" and \"Could you please tell me where the restrooms are?\" are correct English, but the first could sound rude . It's important to use correct language, but sometimes we need to learn how to be polite .\nIn English, just like in Chinese, we change the way we speak when talking with different people. If you say to your teacher, \"Where is my book?\" This will sound rude. But if you say, \"Excuse me, Mr West. Do you know where my book is?\" Your question will sound much more polite. Of course it might be all right to say \"Where is my book?\" in some situations, perhaps with people you know well.\n\"Peter, lend me your pen.\" can sound rude in English. Usually in English, polite questions are longer such as \"Could you please...?\" or \"Can I ask...?\" It sounds more polite to say, \"Peter, could you please lend me your pen?\" Sometimes we might even need to spend some time when you stop a stranger in the street. We might first say, \"Excuse me. I wonder if you can help me\" or \"I'm sorry to trouble you but,\" before asking them for help.\nIt might seem that speaking politely is more difficult than being direct . However, in order not to offend  people, learning about language etiquette  is just as important as learning grammar or vocabulary. And doing this will also help you become better at English, or any other language you wish to speak.", "id": "middle6080.txt"}
