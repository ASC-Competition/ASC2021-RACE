But only some people remember their dreams. Our dreams often include all the senses--smells, sounds, sights, tastes and things we touch.\nEarly in the twentieth century, two famous scientists developed their personal ideas about dreams. Austrian psychiatrist  Sigmund Freud believed people often dream about things they want but can't have. Swiss  psychiatrist Carl Jung worked closely with Freud for several years, but he believed dreams provide solutions to problems we face when we are awake.\nOther researchers are studying how dreaming helps our bodies work with problems and very sad emotions .
