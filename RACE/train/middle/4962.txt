Your love is all I ever needed. I wish you enough to.\" They kissed goodbye and the daughter left. I could see the father was very sad.\nSuddenly the father walked towards me and asked me, \"Did you ever say goodbye to someone knowing it would be the last time?\"\nHis words made me think of my father. Realizing that my father's days were limited  , I took the time to tell him face to face how much he meant to me. So I understood what this father was experiencing.\n\"Yes, I did.\" I answered, \"But why is this a last goodbye?\"\n\"I am old and my daughter lives much too far away. Maybe her next trip back will be for my funeral  ,\" he said.\n\"When you were saying goodbye, I heard you say 'I wish you enough'. What does that mean?\"\nHe began to smile. \"My parents used to say it to me. When we say 'I wish you enough', we want the other person to have a life filled with enough good things.\" He stopped for a moment and continued, \"I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright. I wish you enough rain to appreciate (, ) the sun more. I wish you enough happiness to keep your spirit alive. I wish you enough pain so that the smallest joys in life seem much bigger... I wish you enough 'Hellos' to get you through the final 'Goodbye'\".\nHe then said goodbye to me and walked away.", "id": "middle4962.txt"}
