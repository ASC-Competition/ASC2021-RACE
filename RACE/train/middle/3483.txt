He is five years old. He gets many nice birthday presents from his family and one of them is a big drum .\n\"Who gives him the drum?\" his father asks.\n\"His grandfather does.\" answers Jim's mother.\nJim likes his drum very much. He makes a noise with it, but his mother doesn't say anything about it. His father is not at home. He is working in a school. So he doesn't hear the noise.\nBut one of the neighbors doesn't like the noise at all. So one morning she takes a knife and goes into Jim's room. Jim is making a noise with the drum.
