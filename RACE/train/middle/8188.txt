I spent a lot of time planning my party to make it interesting. I was thinking about having a \"Remember the Good Times\" party. Everyone who is coming is going to graduate  soon. I thought I should put up some photos of my friends and pictures from popular television shows on the wall. The food could be the things we've always loved (hamburgers, ice creams and French fries). I don't know if my idea is going to be good for my birthday party. What do you think, Miss Lee?\nAnswer:\nHi, Maria, I love the idea of the \"Remember the Good Times\" party. It sounds like a graduation party. I love the idea of eating your favorite foods! It's fun, easy and cheap! You can bring photos of your class trip to remember the places where you went. I hope you will have a wonderful birthday party! Have a wonderful 14th birthday!", "id": "middle8188.txt"}
