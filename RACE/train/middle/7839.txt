The company is celebrating 60 years since its first theme park, Disneyland, opened in California, US in 1955.\nDisney has opened many more parks all over the world since it made history in California. Shanghai Disneyland is expected to open in 2016, bringing Disney's popular parks here to the Chinese mainland for the first time.\nSo why has Disneyland been so popular for 60 years? Well, it's described as \"the Happiest Place on Earth\" and \"a place for the young and _ \". Many Americans have grown up with the parks, as ex--Disneyland president Paul Pressler said in 1995: \"There is an emotional relationship that people have with this park.\"\nDisneyland was one of the first theme parks anywhere in the world that had \"lands\" and rides with themes. Disney's storytelling in rides like roller coasters  is a big reason for their parks' success. \"We tell a story in everything we do,\" Pressler said. Disney rides such as The seven Dwarves Mine Train and Peter Pan's Flight come from its movies. One ride from its 2013 hit movie Frozen will surely be coming soon, perhaps at the new Shanghai Disneyland.\nDisney's parks haven't always been popular everywhere, however. When Disneyland Paris opened in 1992, some French people felt that American culture was invading France. But still, the park stayed open and today it is a popular place for European visitors.\nWhatever you may think of them, you can't say that on their 60th birthday, Disney's parks aren't still going strong. How many Disney theme parks will you have visited by the time their 70th birthday comes around?", "id": "middle7839.txt"}
