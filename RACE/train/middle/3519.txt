Twenty-two years ago, One day her parents were out, she fell into a fire stove at home, and the fire burned her fingers badly. The family was too poor at the time to afford the expensive medical treatment ,at last she lost all her fingers.\n\"When I was a child, I was unable to hold chopsticks.

From then on I knew that one had to put great efforts into what she was doing,\" said PengJiangya.\nAs a child , PengJiangya often saw others make cross-stitch   and then she decided to learn how to make it herself. \" Of course, it took me many years to do that, when I was 18, I got it.\" Said Peng.
