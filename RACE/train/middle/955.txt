We visit the famous city quite regularly. After all, it only takes three hours from London to Pairs. It's always a pleasure visiting places we really like, exploring areas we've never been.\nThe only unlucky thing this time was the weather. As soon as we got there the temperature reached almost 35 degrees C (which lasted until we left). It was so hot that Matthew just couldn't _ it -- for him, it wasn't the most enjoyable trip. I felt sorry for him because every time we go there he has to put up with   my endless shopping spree   ...\nBecause of the heat, we ended up just having lots of ice-cream and drinks most of the time, although we managed to pay a few visits to the new Herme shop on rue de Vaugirard at least. It's not as busy as the shop on rue Bonaparte so you can choose whatever you like without worrying about a queue behind you! I really enjoyed his bread this time as well as the cakes. And I must say that his Croissant aux Amandes and Bostock were simply the best I've ever had.", "id": "middle955.txt"}
