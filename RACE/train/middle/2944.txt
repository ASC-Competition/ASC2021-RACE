One day a family went to spend the day in the forest, and the son left his socks there. After the family left, a bear came by, found the socks, and decided to try them on. They fit so well, and he liked them so much that he wouldn't take them off.\nAll the animals talked about the bear's new look. Soon, in that forest, there began appearing squirrels in shirts, rabbits in shoes, and even rats    wearing hats! The forest doctor shook his head, telling animals, \"This can't be good. Animals don't need clothes!\" But no one listened to him. They said he was just out of fashion.\nHowever, _ Several times the squirrel caught his shirt on trees, stopping him in mid-jump and sending him falling to the ground from a tree. The rat couldn't go into his hole without taking off his hat first. Even the bear, because of his socks, slipped  from the river rock and almost killed himself.\nWhen the animals came to see the doctor, he gave them all the same advice, \"Take off those clothes before one day they're going to kill you.\" Those who listened to the doctor's advice stopped having accidents. And the animals realized that they didn't need clothes at all. Starting to wear them had been very dangerous, and they had only done it to make others admire them, and to get attention.", "id": "middle2944.txt"}
