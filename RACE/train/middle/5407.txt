It's 7:00 in the evening in Beijing. I'm writing to tell you something about my life. My father is watching CCTV news. That's his favorite show. My brother is playing computer games. My dog Dick is taking the hat to me. He wants me to put it on and go out for a walk with him. What a clever dog!\nOutside, I can hear cars and buses coming and going quickly. Also there are some boys playing ball games. It's really a noisy but happy evening. Do you think so?\nWhat are your family doing? I know the time here is thirteen hours ahead of the time in New York. Please write to me soon. Best wishes!\nYours,\nDaniel", "id": "middle5407.txt"}
