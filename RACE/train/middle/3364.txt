I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. \"Hi, girl! My name is Rose, I'm 87 years old.\"\n\"Why are you in college at such a young age?\" I asked jokingly.\n\"I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!\" she replied.\nRose became a college symbol this year and she easily made friends with other students.\nAt the end of the term we invited her to speak at our football party. I'll never forget what she taught us.\n\"We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing. There are only two secrets of staying young, being happy and achieving success. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die. We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it!\n\"There is a big difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do anything, you will turn 20 years older. If I am 87 years old, and stay in bed for a year, and never do anything, will turn 88. Anybody can grow older. But every minute counts for young men,\" she added.\nShe ended her speech by singing The Song Rose. She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live them out in our daily lives.\nAt the end of the year, Rose finished the college education. One week after graduation, Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.\nRemember GROWING OLDER IS MANDATORY , GROWING UP IS OPTIONAL .", "id": "middle3364.txt"}
