Since then, Barbie doll, as everyone called her, has become the most successful toy doll in history.  Her parent, the Mattel Company, said that 90% of all American girls between 3 and 10 have at least one Barbie at home.\nHowever, Barbie is facing some trouble at present . There are many similar dolls on the market in competition with her. Another doll named Bratz, for example, came to life thirteen years ago. She looks more like today's pop stars with heavy makeup  and miniskirts. And her company offers more kinds of clothes too.\nIt seems that Barbie has lost her magic among older girls. 'For younger girls, playing with a Barbie is much fun.

In January 2009, Mattel opened its first Barbie store in Shanghai, where girls can shop, eat, drink or even become _ for their own Barbies.\nMattel is planning big celebrations for Barbie's 53rd birthday.

It is hard to say, but 53 is surely not the age to retire .", "id": "middle6651.txt"}
