How could this happen? People used to think that hard-work is the only way to success. But now they have understood that smart work can make them succeed, too.\nHard workers don't mind working for long hours, while smart workers always think of several different answers to these questions, \" Why should I suffer  this? Isn't there s better way to do this?\"  Thanks to these people, we can use computers instead of the abacus  now. Progress in every field  is the direct result of \" try a better way\" by smart workers.\nThere was a large soap factory in Japan. Once it received an unusual letter, complaining  that there was no soap in the soapbox he bought.  How could empty soapboxes go out of the factory? The engineers   checked the producing and packing . The producing was fine, but in about one in ten thousand cases, the packing machine let an empty soapbox go. There was no need to spend a lot of money repairing the machine for such a small problem. The engineer soon work out a solution. He put a huge X-ray machine and two large computers to find out the empty soapboxes. After teaching the worker how to use it, he sat down in his seat, exhausted .\n\" Sir, we could have solved the problem in a much easier and cheaper way.\" said one worker. \" Really? How?\"  \" We can put a huge fan  near the packing machine. The wind will _ the empty boxes. There would be no need for an X-ray machine and computers.\"\nSee, this is smart work. In order to succeed, we should not work hard like the engineer, but also think smartly like this worker.", "id": "middle3714.txt"}
