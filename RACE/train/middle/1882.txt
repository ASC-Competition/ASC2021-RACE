Napoleon Hill wrote, \"whatever the mind of man can conceive   and believe, the mind can achieve.\"\nA young man asked Socrates   the secrets to success. Socrates told the young man to meet him near the river the next morning.  When they meet, Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river. When the water got up to their necks, Socrates took the young man by surprise and pressed him into the water. The boy struggled  to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy stared turning blue. Socrates pulled his head out of the water and the first thing the young man did was to gasp  and take a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, \"What did you want the most when you were there?\" the boy replied. \"Air.\" Socrates said,\" That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air, then you will get it. There is no other secret.\"\nA burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishment . Just like a small fire cannot give much heat, a weak desire cannot produce great results.", "id": "middle1882.txt"}
