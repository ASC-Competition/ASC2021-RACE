I felt too tired to think of any special gifts.\nKnowing Justin felt the same way, I decided one year not to buy the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so on. I reached for something special just for Justin. The inspiration came in an unusual way.\nOur son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling  at the junior level at the school he attended; and shortly before Christmas, there was a match against a team sponsored   by an inner-city church.These youngsters, dressed in such worn-out shoes that shoe strings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, while our boys were in their blue and gold uniforms and new wrestling shoes.\nAs the match began, I was shocked to see that the other team were wrestling without wearing helmets   to protect their ears. Well, our boys ended up defeating them. We took every weight class.\nJustin, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, \"I wish just one of them could have won,\" he said. \"They have a lot potential   , but losing like this could take the heart out of them.\" Justin loved kids--all kids, and he knew them, having coached little league football and baseball. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought different kinds of wrestling helmets and shoes. I sent them to inner-city church without leaving my name.\nOn Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Justin what I had done and that was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year and since then the envelope has become the highlight of our Christmas.", "id": "middle500.txt"}
