The form is only on the school website. Once you are told that you can volunteer, you will only have to sign in with our clock system, wear your badge with your name on it, and when leaving, sign out to make sure your volunteer hours are recorded.\nThings you need to remember:\n1. Sign in with the clock system every time you are in school.\n2. Wear your badge.\n3. Sign out when you leave to make sure your volunteer hours are recorded.\nEveryone, whether you are a volunteer or a visitor, will be asked to show one of the following to tell who you are in order to get past the school gate:\n1. A driver's license in use;\n2. A state-issued ID card;\n3. A work visa;\n4. A green card.\nIf you are interested in volunteering, please fill out a school volunteer form and return it to the school Volunteer Officer or front office.
