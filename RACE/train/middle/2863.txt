They had been swimming, gone to the movies, played video games, and even built a castle out of some old cardboard boxes. But today they were so bored. \"At least we would have something to do.\" Tom thought for a while and suggested, \"Let's make some popcorn and lemonade and sell it outside.\"\nThe boys went to the kitchen and asked Tom's mom if she would help them make some lemonade while they popped the popcorn. Tom's mom got the lemons from the refrigerator and also a small amount of sugar. She mixed up the lemonade while the boys started popping the popcorn.\nTom and Rob got a small table from the garage and set it up near the sidewalk. They made a red sign telling everyone that popcorn and lemonade was for sale. The boys sat for about ten minutes before they got their first sale. Mrs. Jenkins, one of their neighbors, was walking her dog. \"It's so hot today.\" \"I sure can use a drink,\" she said. Soon the boys were busy handing out popcorn to Mr. Baker. He was walking down the street sending the mail. \"I need a break,\" he said. \"Walking all over the neighborhood gave me an appetite.\"\nThe boys had only three popcorn bags left and enough lemonade for three more cups. \"Wow, I didn't think the popcorn and lemonade would sell that fast. We made six dollars,\" said Tom. \"If we get bored again before school starts, we can try selling more lemonade with cookies  next time,\" laughed Rob.", "id": "middle2863.txt"}
