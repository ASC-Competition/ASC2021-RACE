The city is perhaps most famous for its annual   Milan Fashion Week and its world-class soccer teams AC Milan and Inter Milan. And May will see it host the six-month Milan Expo , the theme of which is food and nutrition .\nMilan may not be the first place tourists think of when they think of Italy. Rome is the most famous city in Italian history, Venice draws visitors who want to travel along its canals  and Florence is popular with the art lovers. Yet Milan can often be let off tourists' lists. But although some see Milan as the \"Ugly Sister\" of these cities, in 2015, the city is \"Suddenly back in fashion in a big way\".\nThe delicious Milan Expo will look at the future of food, trying to answer the question of how Earth's fast-growing population can be fed in the future. According to the Lonely Planet website, \"144 countries will set up shops in northwest of central Milan, forming a mini city-within-a-city\".\nMilan's famous opera house,  La Scala, normally  closed in the summer, will also host daily performances during the Expo, reported Fox News.\nNot interested in opera? Don't worry. Visitors who prefer sports may want to visit the San Siro Stadium , home of the soccer teams AC Milan and Inter Milan. The stadium is one of the most famous in Europe and has seen many important games over the years, both in Series A   and the European Champions league .\nSo even if all of its fashion and beautiful people can make Milan seem \"Soulless \" as Lonely Planet said, it still has \"a serious sense of history and place\". Many people will be discovering it this year, and eating great food from all over the world to help solve world problems. Will you?", "id": "middle5466.txt"}
