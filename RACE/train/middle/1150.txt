I'm glad that I am getting on well with it.\nI find English quite difficult, but very interesting. When I first started, I thought I had only to remember the new words and learn some grammar  I knew little about English idioms .I thought each English word had the same meaning in Chinese. When I learn to say\"I see a book on the desk,\" I thought the English word \"see \" was just like the Chinese word \" kan \",So one day when my teacher asked me,\" what are you doing?\", I answered, \"I'm seeing a book.\" \"That's wrong .\"  the teacher said, \"you don't see a book, You read a book. You can't use English word like a Chinese one.. Be sure not to make the same mistake again.\"\nAfter that I began to pay more attention to the differences between Chinese and English. For example, in English we say a\" high mountain\", but a\" tall man. \" In Chinese we use the same word \"gao \" for both.. Again in English we say\" take part in the sports meeting \", \" attend the meeting \" and\" join the army,\"  while in Chinese we can use \"can jia \" for all three. Interesting ,isn't?\nSo to study English doesn't only mean hard wok, it can be great fun,  too! We not only have to pay attention to pronunciation, grammar spelling and handwriting, we also have to understand English idioms. We can learn English well only in the way!\nBut all this is only a beginning and I still have a long way to go. I'll try my best and work even harder than before. I must speak and listen to English more both in and out of class. I must learn English well so that I can work well when I grow up.", "id": "middle1150.txt"}
