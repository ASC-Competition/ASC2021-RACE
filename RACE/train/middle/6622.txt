If I have dinner with a Chinese host, he always puts more food onto my plates as soon as I have emptied it. That often discomforts me greatly. I have to eat the food even if I don't want to, because it is considered bad manners in the West to leave one's food on the plate. I have already noticed that when a Chinese sits at an American's dinner party, he very often refuses the offer of food or drink though he is in fact still hungry or thirsty. This might be good manners in China, but it is not in the West at all. In the United States, it is impolite to keep asking someone again and again or insist on his accepting something. Americans have a direct way of speaking. If they want something, they will ask for it. If not, they will say, \"No, thanks.\" When an American is fed with beer by the host, for example, he might say, \"No, thanks. I'll take some diet, Pepsi-Cola if you have it. \"That is what an American will do. So when you go to the United States, you had better remember the famous saying: When in Rome, do as the Romans do.", "id": "middle6622.txt"}
