Children should study in school as hard as they can. They should not have to do heavy work with their bodies. When parents or others force their children to work hard, the results are never good. Many may be very bad. If a farmer makes his son work like a man, he may easily learn to hate farming.\nChildren sometimes do too much in gardens, in shops, or even in their own homes. They soon begin to hate such work with a force, because that can destroy their happiness. But there may be a worse loss, child's love for its parents. The feeling may become something different. When that happens, the old kind of love never returns.", "id": "middle2420.txt"}
