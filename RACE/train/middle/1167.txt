He has a beautiful hat, and he often put his head out of the window during the trip and looked at the mountains, But the wind blew his hat off. Mr Green quickly took his bag and threw that out of the window, too.\nThe other people in the carriage  laughed. \"Is your bag going to bring your beautiful hat back?\" they asked.\n\"No,\" Mr Green answered, \"But there's no name and no address on my hat, and there's a name and an address on the bag.
