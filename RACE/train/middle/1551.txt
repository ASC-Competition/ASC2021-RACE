They might shake hands  , kiss or hug  . But do you ever wonder how dogs say hello?\nIf you are a dog lover, you already know the answer to this question. When you arrive home, your dog jumps up into your lap  . It wags   its tail, and sometimes gives you wet kisses.\nLike humans, dogs have five senses  : smell, touch, sight, hearing and taste. Humans use sight as the main sense for recognizing   one another. But dogs have poor eyesight. They use smell to recognize others. A dog's sense of smell is much better than a human's. It is through its sense of smell that tells the differences between different people.\nDogs use smell to recognize other dogs, too. They tell the differences by the smell of pee   and pooh  . When two dogs meet, they smell each other's noses. Then they go side to side, and smell each other's butts  . By smelling its friend's behind, a dog knows who it is with.\nThat is also why dogs smell everything they can on the road. By smelling grass, trees and signposts  , dogs know which other neighborhood dogs have been around.", "id": "middle1551.txt"}
