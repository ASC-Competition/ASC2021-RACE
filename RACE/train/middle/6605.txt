How much do you know about it? The following questions and their answers will help you to know more about the Internet.\nWhat is the Internet?\nThe Internet is a large, world-wide collection   of computer networks  . A network is a small group of computers put together. The Internet is many different kinds of networks from all over the world. These networks are called the Internet. If you have learned to use the Internet, you can have a lot of interest on the World Wide Web   .\nWhat is the World Wide Web?\nThe World Wide Web has been the most popular development of the Internet. It is like a big electronic   book with millions of pages. These pages are called homepages. You can find information about almost anything in the world on these pages. For example, you can use the Internet instead of a library to find information for your homework. You can also find information about your favourite sport or film star, talk to your friends or even do some shopping on the pages. Most pages have words, pictures and even sound or music.\nWhat is e-mail?\nElectronic mail (e-mail) is a way of sending messages to other people. It's much quicker and cheaper than sending a letter. If you want to use e-mail, you must have an e-mail address. This address must have letters and dots   and an @ (means \"at\"). For example: Lily @ Yahoo.com. Write a message, type a person's e-mail address, and then send the message across the Internet. People don't need to use stamps, envelopes or go to the post office because of the invention of the Internet. Quick, easy and interesting -- that's the Internet.", "id": "middle6605.txt"}
