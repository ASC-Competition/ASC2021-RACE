For she wanted to learn, he took her to a hole in the ice, and told her to put her tail  down into the water.\nHe told her to keep the tail there for a long time. Then when she pulled the tail out of the water, she would find fish around the tail.\nThe bear was foolish enough to believe what the fox said. She sat for a long time with her tail in the water. She was waiting for the fish. But when she tried to pull her tail out of the water she found that it was frozen  in the ice.\nShe asked the fox to pull her out, but the fox laughed to itself and ran away. So she called Father Bear to help her.\nFather Bear came. He pulled her hard and at last got her out. But a part of her tail was in the ice. That is why people find the bear's tail so short.", "id": "middle3657.txt"}
