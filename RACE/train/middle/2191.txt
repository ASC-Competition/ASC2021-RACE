If a person has an accident, he / she needs medical care before a doctor can be found. When you give first aid, you must know three things:\nFirst, when a person stops breathing  , open his / her mouth to see if there is food in his / her mouth. Second, if a person cannot breathe, try to start his / her breathing at once, using a mouth-to-mouth way. Third, if a person is hurt badly, try to stop the bleeding   at once. And then take him / her to a doctor, because if a person loses one third of his / her blood, he / she may be in great danger.\nMany accidents may happen at home, and everyone should know some first aid to deal with common injuries. When a person _ by an animal, wash the wound with cold running water before he / she is taken to see a doctor. When a person is burnt, wash and cool the area of the skin under the cold tap for a while, then put a piece of dry clean cloth over the burn. If a person is badly burnt, take him / her to the doctor. If a person cuts his / her finger, clean it and put a piece of clean paper round the cut.\nIn the future we should learn more about first aid and try to spread   it.", "id": "middle2191.txt"}
