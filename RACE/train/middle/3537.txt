But as soon as you turn the corner, you find yourself at the end of a very long queue. It's another _ ! It is stop-start for the rest of your journey. Meanwhile, at the same time in Antarctica , snow covers the land. A group of emperor penguins crowd together to keep warm, using stop-and-go movements to protect themselves from the winds. Can you see the connection?\nEmperor penguins move like cars in traffic jams to keep warm, that's according to new research by the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Center for Polar and Marina Research in Germany. A penguin only needs to move 2cm in any direction for its neighbor to do the same thing. These movements then flow  through the whole group of penguins like a \"traveling wave\".\nThese waves also help smaller crowds join bigger groups, keeping more and more of their friends warm. A single Antarctic \"traffic jam\" has thousands of penguins. Interestingly, the technology used for studying road traffic jams was used to study the penguins. This included studying time-lapse  videos. Scientists also discovered that unlike on the road, these waves can be made by any penguin and in any direction.\nWith temperatures usually dropping below -50degC, and winds reaching speeds of up to 200km/h, these traveling waves are very important for penguins to keep warm.\nThese penguins can also teach us a lesson. In big groups, they learn to be orderly and patient, and to never crash into each other. These are skills we should all learn from them when we are on the road!", "id": "middle3537.txt"}
