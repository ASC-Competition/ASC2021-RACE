The animal uses its nose. Right away it smells its new places. Then it makes wider and wider circles, smelling all the time. Before long it can find its way home very well, even in the dark. It simply follows something it knows well.\nStories happen about animals who found their way across land they had never smelled before. Take the case of Smoky, a small white cat.
