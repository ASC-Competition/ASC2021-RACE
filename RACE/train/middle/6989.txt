Some like planting flowers, some like exercising and others like building model ships. I am Jack and I like collecting stamps.\nThere are four people in my family and they are my parents, my brother and I. My father works in a big company. He usually goes abroad three or four times a year. Two years ago when he was working abroad, he sent home a letter with a beautiful stamp on the envelope. The stamp was very beautiful and I like it very much. Since then, when my father goes abroad, I always ask him to send me different stamps from different countries.\nMy brother went to college last year and he often wrote me letters instead of chatting with me or sending e-mail to me, so that I could see the beautiful stamps on the envelopes and I always took them down and put them in my box. Now I have more than a thousand stamps. From these stamps I can learn a lot of knowledge like the history persons. Whenever I look through the beautiful stamps, I will feel relaxed and happy. They are like my \"good and nice friends.\"", "id": "middle6989.txt"}
