And a family was standing in front of us.\nThe family had eight children. Their clothes were not expensive but clean.The children talked about the clowns( ), elephants, monkeys and other things excitedly. It was their first time to go to the circus.\nThe ticket lady asked the father how many tickets he wanted. He proudly answered, \"I want eight children's tickets and two adults' tickets, so I can take my family to the circus.\"\nThe ticket lady said the price. The man's wife lowered her head and there was no smile on th e man's face. He quietly asked, \"How much did  you say?\"\nThe ticket lady said the price again. The man didn't have enough money. How could he tell his eight kids the bad news? My dad put his hand into his pocket and pulled out a $20 bill and dropped it on the ground.(In fact, we were not rich!) Then my dad said, \"Excuse me, sir, this dropped out of your pocket.\"\nThe man knew what was going on. He looked into my dad's eyes, held my dad's hand in his, and took the $20 bill. \"Thank you, sir, thank you. This really means a lot to me and my family.\"\nMy father and I went back home. We didn't go to see the circus that night, but we didn't care.", "id": "middle6220.txt"}
