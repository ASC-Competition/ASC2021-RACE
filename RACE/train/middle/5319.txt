But what if you were only able to catch  fish with just your hands?\nLast Sunday, my dad and I went to Lipu in Guangxi. There, we saw a big traditional  game ----the fish catching game. On that day, lots of local people took off their shirts and jumped into a river. There were many fish in the river. But they could only use a small ladle . Some of them waved   their ladles to drive the fish together. And some tried to catch the fish quickly. It looks easy, but the water was so muddy   that no one could see the fish clearly. They had to touch and feel the fish.\nVisitors like us were also excited to see such an interesting game. We cheered and laughed. Although most people didn't catch even one fish, everyone was so happy that day. The game was really interesting.", "id": "middle5319.txt"}
