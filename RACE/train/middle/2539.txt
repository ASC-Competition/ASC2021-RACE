He has spent many years in Madagascar studying lemurs  . Here is an interview with him.\nReporter: What were you like as a kid?\nLuke: As a kid, I was an explorer  . I lived with my grandparents on a farm in Alabama. I spent a lot of time outdoors. It was a lot of fun and I enjoyed that. From the time I was 6 to 16 years old I was an actor. My mom asked me to audition   for a show in Birmingham. I asked my mom to buy me some video games and she agreed, so I went for it and finally got the part. Later, I became a professional actor. For many years I went all over the US performing on different stages.\nReporter: How did you start to study lemurs?\nLuke: When I was on the farm, I was really a wild child and came to love wild things. I did a lot of photography   in high school. I became a photographer and did photography for the local paper. Then I became a student of Duke University. At Duke University there is a center -- Lemur Center. I got a job there as a work-study student and met lemurs there for the first time.
