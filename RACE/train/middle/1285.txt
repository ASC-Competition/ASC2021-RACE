Within a few days the whole neighborhood knew the story. The neighbor was deeply hurt. Later the woman learned that it was completely untrue. She was very sorry and went to a wise old man to find out what she could do to repair the harm.\n\"Go to the market,\" he said, \"and buy a chicken, and have it killed, then on your way home, pick its feathers  and drop them one by one along the road.\" Although surprised by this advice, the woman did what she was told.\nThe next day the wise man said, \"Now, go and collect all those feathers you dropped yesterday and bring them back to me.\"\nThe woman followed the same road, but she was so _ when she found the wind had blown all the feathers away. After looking for hours, she returned with only three in her hand.\n\"You see,\" said the old man, \"it's easy to drop them, but it's impossible to get them back. So it is with gossip. It doesn't take much to spread  a gossip, but once you do, you can never completely undo  the wrong.\"", "id": "middle1285.txt"}
