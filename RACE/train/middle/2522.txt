We hadn't seen each other for a few months, so I decided to start a talk with her. My cousin is studying in a college of our city. Her hobby is surfing the Internet. Every time I am on the computer, she is always online, listening to music or decorating her \"personal space\". I like visiting her space. It's creative and modern. I can't design such a colorful web page as hers.\nWhen I read the sentences she sent to me, I noticed that the Chinese characters had been changed, but I could still guess their meanings. I took a strong interest in this type of new characters. Further watching made me realize that they added some common Chinese radicals  to the original characters, making them more vivid , a little like Japanese. My cousin said this gives new life to the Chinese language and culture.\nIt is true that the Internet has _ our language, but I still can't accept this new change. Some Chinese characters have meanings in the shapes; one shouldn't superficially  change them by adding an additional radical. So I advised my cousin to change her new idea and use standard characters to communicate. And she willingly accepted my advice.", "id": "middle2522.txt"}
