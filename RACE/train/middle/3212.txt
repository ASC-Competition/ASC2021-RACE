They serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help find out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be: your classmate, neighbor, teacher, long-lost friend or even a real stranger. But you know that every moment they will affect   your life in some serious way.\nSometimes things happen to you. At the time they may seem terrible, painful   and unfair. But later you realize that without getting over those difficulties you would have never realized your further ability and strength. Everything happens for a reason and nothing happens by chance or with good or bad luck.\nThe people you meet affect your life, and the successes and failure   you experience, create who you are. Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most _ and important ones.\nEnjoy every day even every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people you have never talked to before, and really listen. You should set your sights high, hold your head up, tell yourself you are a great one and believe in yourself.\nYou can make your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it.\n,A, B, C, D.", "id": "middle3212.txt"}
