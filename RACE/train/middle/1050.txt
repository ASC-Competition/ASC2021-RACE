He had two old ministers. One was kind and the other was bad. The bad minister often said bad words about the kind minister before the king. The king was very angry.\nOne day the king said to the bad minister, \"Write two words on two pieces of paper. Write 'live' on one piece and 'die' on the other. Then put them in a jar and tell him to choose. If he takes out the paper with 'live' on it, I'll let him go. If he takes out the paper with 'die' on it, I'll kill him at once. \"\nThe bad minister was quite happy. He got two pieces of paper ready. He wrote 'die' on each piece of paper.\nThe kind old man came. He knew the bad minister wanted to kill him. He also knew the words on the two pieces were both \"die\". But he knew what to do. Later the king had to keep his word and let the old minister go. Do you know what the kind man did about this at that time?\nHe chose a piece of paper and ate it, When they saw the word \"die\" on the other piece, the king and other ministers thought the word on the piece that the kind man had eaten must be \"live\", so he saved his own life by his cleverness .", "id": "middle1050.txt"}
