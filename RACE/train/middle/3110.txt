Here is some important advice to remember when speaking English in the United States.\n*Americans have difficulties understanding foreign accents. Many Americans are not used to foreign accents. This requires patience from both of you.\n*Talk about places: Americans love to talk about places. When speaking to a stranger, ask them where they come from and then say something about that place. For example: \"Oh, I have a friend who worked in Los Angeles. He says it's a beautiful place to live in.\" Most Americans will then willingly talk about their experiences of living in or visiting that city or place.\n*Talk about work: It is common for Americans to ask \"What do you do?\" It's not considered impolite as in some countries and is a popular topic of discussion between strangers.\n*Talk about sports: Americans love sports! However, they love American sports. When speaking about football, most Americans understand \"American football\", not soccer.\n*Be careful when expressing ideas about race, religion or other sensitive topics:The United States is a society with different cultures. Americans are very sensitive to other cultures and ideas.", "id": "middle3110.txt"}
