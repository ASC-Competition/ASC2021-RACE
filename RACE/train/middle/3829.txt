He began to go to school the year before last and now he's in Grade Three. He lives not far from the school but he is often late for class. He likes watching TV in the evening and goes to bed late, so he can't get up on time in the morning.\nThis term, Mrs. Black, Peter's aunt, works in Peter's school. She teaches Grade Three math. She's strict  with Peter and often tells the boy to obey  the school rules and come to school on time. Yesterday morning Peter got up late. When he hurried to school, it was half past eight. His aunt was waiting for him at the school gate.\n\"You're ten minutes late for the first class, Peter,\" Mrs. Black said angrily. \"Why are you often late for class?\"\n\"Every time I get to the street corner, I see a guidepost . It says: \"SCHOOL--GO SLOW!'\"", "id": "middle3829.txt"}
