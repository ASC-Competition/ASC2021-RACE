Every evening we get into homework battles . Three afternoons a week, she has activities(netball, singing) after school and by the time we get home early, we argue  about whether she should do her homework right after school, or if she should have some time to rest and play first. When Maria at last sits down to do her homework, she seems to want me there helping all the time, I do want to help her, but I'm sure that she is going to need to be able to do it on her own. And in fact, most of the time, I have other things I need to be doing. It seems that children these days have much more homework than we did, and some of it is really beyond  their abilities . As you can see, I'm really worried about homework and I really don't know what I should do. Any ideas?", "id": "middle1103.txt"}
