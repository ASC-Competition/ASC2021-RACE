What inside our bodies makes us grow in a certain way? The answer is DNA. It was first discovered by a young Swiss doctor in 1868.\nDNA is like a computer program for your body. Almost every cell  in your body includes DNA. The way DNA in the cell decides why you are the way you are. For example your friend might have larger ears than you. This is because their DNA is different from yours.\nDNA lives in the cell and is ordered in a structure called a \"double helix \". In each double helix there are links called as chromosomes . These chromosomes are made from four bases that arrange themselves in millions of different ways. The way these bases choose to line up is what makes the DNA code for that cell.\nDNA is also called a \"gene \". This is a very interesting thing. Genes are passed down from your parents. That is why you might have the same smile like your dad's or mom's!\nIn February, scientists found the skeleton  of Richard III, King of England from 1483-1485, under a car park in England. It seems unlikely that scientists could identify a 527-year-old skeleton. However, they matched the skeleton's DNA to a sample from one of his direct descendants .
