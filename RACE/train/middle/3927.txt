Mr Dodd was an old funny man with a beard. \"What's the problem ?\" the doctor asked her. \"I am very worried about my son, Jake,\" Mrs Black said, \"I can't stop him from betting. He spends all his money betting on horse races. And even worse he'll bet on everything. It doesn't matter what it is.\" The doctor said, \"I've saved many people from gambling before. Send him to me.\"\nThe next day Mrs Black sent her son to see the doctor. While they were talking , the boy was looking at the doctor's beard. Suddenly he said, \"I bet you $ 50 that your beard is not a real one.\" \"Oh, no, \" the doctor said. \"Can I pull your beard and find out ?\" the boy said. The doctor thought this is a good way to teach him a lesson; so he said, \"Ok, if my beard is real , you will have to pay me $ 50.\" The boy pulled it and soon found out it was real. The doctor laughed.\nTwo days later the doctor telephoned Mrs Black, \"I think I've saved your son.\" He told her the story. But Mrs Black said, \"You're wrong. You've made him worse.\" \"How can that be ?\" the doctor asked . \"Before he went to see you, he bet me $ 100 that you would ask him to pull your beard !\"\n,.", "id": "middle3927.txt"}
