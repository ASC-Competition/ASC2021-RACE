By using hair as a replacement, Karki says that solar panels can be produced for around PS 23.\nKarki got the idea from a Stephen Hawking book, which explained how to create energy from hair. The device   that Karki has showed can produce 18w of energy -- plenty to _ a mobile phone.\n\"Half a kilo of hair can be bought for only 16p in Nepal and last a few months; but a pack of batteries   would cost 50p and last a few nights,\" according to The Daily Mail.\nThe solar panel is easy to service as the hair is easy to replace. Karki has now sent out several devices to other places near his home for testing. He said, \"First I wanted to provide energy for my home, then my village. Now I am thinking for the whole world.\"", "id": "middle3384.txt"}
