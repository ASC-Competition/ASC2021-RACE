What should you do ? How can you make the right decision ?\nWhen you have a difficult decision to make , you may probably think it over and over again for hours, weighting up all the advantages and disadvantages before coming to a decision .Or ,maybe you decide it quickly without thinking carefully .But according to scientific research, there's a better way to do this: Sleep on it .\nIn a resent study , scientists made an experiment . They offered the participants  some information about different types of cars .And they asked them to decide hypothetically  which one would be the best fit. Some of them were asked to make the decision right away ,while others were asked to choose the next morning.\nThe result of the survey was interesting. The people who had a good night's sleep were energetic the next morning .And they choose the best quality cars. But those who made quick decisions chose cars with bad quality.\nSo ,if someone asks you to make a big decision ,don't rush to give an answer at once .Instead ,take a step back and get a good night's sleep. Chances are that ,in the morning , you'll know exactly what to do .", "id": "middle5420.txt"}
