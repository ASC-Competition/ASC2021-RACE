Our reporter Mary Owen met him at\nhis home in the south of London and be told her all about the trip.\nReporter: What gave you the idea to make a trip around India on an elephant, Chris?\nChris: Well, it all started the idea two years ago when I was planning a trip to India. I visited a\nphoto exhibition of elephants and I realized that the only enjoyable way to make a trip around\nIndia was on an elephant.\nReporter: What did you do next?\nChris: I flew to New Delhi and started looking for an elephant, I needed an elephant trained to\ncarry people. I didn't know anything about elephants, so I asked an expert  for help. He\ntaught me how to ride an elephant. He also helped me find an elephant.\nReporter: How long did it take to find a suitable elephant?\nChris: Not too long. I bought a female elephant called Tara for about 6, 000 dollars.\nReporter: Can you tell me about the journey?\nChris: Tara and I set off from New Delhi a week later. We were going to Sonepur in northern\nIndia. There is a big elephant market there and I could sell Tara easily. And what a ride! Elephants\ncan travel at about 6 miles an hour and Sonepur is more than 1, 200 km away. It took us 64 days to\ncomplete the journey.\nReporter: Did you have any problems on your journey?\nChris: Yes, a few. But nothing serious. On the third day, Tara hurt her foot. Btu that got better\nquickly. Also, there was a lot of heavy rain during the first week and we got very wet!\nReporter: What happened when you reached Sonepur?\nChris: My plan was to sell Tara. But I was very fond of her. I couldn't take her back to Britain\nand I didn't want to sell her at the market. I happened to meet some people who wanted an\nelephant for their national park in southern India. I knew that Tara would be safe with them, so I\ngave her to them. I was very sad to say goodbye.", "id": "middle3302.txt"}
