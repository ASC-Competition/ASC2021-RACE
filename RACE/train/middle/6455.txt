A young man once went into town and bought himself a pair of trousers. When he got home, he went upstairs  to his bedroom and put them on. He found that they were about two inches too long.\nHe came downstairs, where his mother and his two sisters were washing up tea things in the kitchen. \"These new trousers are too long.\" He said. \" They need shortening  by about two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me, please?\" His mother and sisters were busy and they said nothing.\nBut as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went quietly upstairs to her son's bedroom and shortened the trousers by two inches. She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters.\nLater on, after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly upstairs without saying anything to anyone and shortened the trousers by two inches.\nThe younger sister went to the cinema, but when she came back, she, too, remembered what her brother had said. So she ran upstairs and took two inches off the legs of the new trousers.", "id": "middle6455.txt"}
