While we were waiting for our meals, we decided to use all our small change and make our wallets light, so we counted it out as we waited.\nI vaguely  remember seeing a man sitting nearby. When our meals arrived, we found a note. It read,\" Your breakfast has been paid for. Hope you have a lovely day.\"\nIt was a wonderful surprise as nothing like that had ever happened to us.
