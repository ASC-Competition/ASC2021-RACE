We refused, because we like snakes, and we don't want to see them killed, \" said Fred.\nSome of the snakes that they catch are kept as pets; some are given to the North Carolina State University. Most, including the poisonous snakes, are set free in the wild, usually in a national park.\nFred suggests that people should treat snakes with care. \"Actually snakes are very shy and gentle creatures. They only attack if they are frightened. However, you have to know how to treat a snake properly!\"\nAccording to one happy family, the Snake Catchers are good.
