Terrible! The big exam is coming in less than two months. You still have a lot to do. How will you spend it? We invited three students to share their stories.\nDou Yi, 15,Beijing\nMy chemistry  used to be poor in the past. I got scores of around 40 on every test. During the last term, I decide to beat chemistry. I will start to work hard. In class I take every possible note. After school, I spend most of my time studying chemistry. My parents also ask their friend, a chemistry teacher, to help me . Finally in the latest exam, I got 65! How happy I am!\nWang Zhaolin, 16, Chongqing\nMy foot got hurt a week before the big PE exam . Luckily, I recovered  in time. For PE , all you need is to practice. Sports can also help you relax. Be careful not to get hurt as I did.\nWang Feixuan, 15, Xi'an\nMy experience is that for Junior3, every minute of the last term is important. Don't waste any of them. I try to remember English words while waiting in line to get my lunch. I read textbooks on the bus to and from school. I work hard at home and sometimes stay up late studying. Want to have fun?
