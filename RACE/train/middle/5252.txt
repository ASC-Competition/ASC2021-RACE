As I was about to leave, I noticed a piece of paper on the floor. I picked it up and saw the words \"FINAL-TERM EXAMINATION\" at the top. I put the paper into my school bag secretly and ran out of the room.\nAfter I came back home, I took out the paper quickly. It was the exam paper of my worst subject, History. I felt excited. My heart beat fast. I took out my History book and started working on the answer. I had never answered any questions so seriously.\nOn the day of the History exam, I went into the exam hall confidently. When the paper was sent to me, I dreamt of getting the highest mark in the whole grade and could not help smiling. \"My History teacher always encouraged me to work hard and get better grades, but I let him down time and time again. This time I will give him a big surprise,\" I thought.\nWhen  the  teacher  said  we could  start,  I turned  the  paper  over. To my surprise,  all  the questions were different. Later I felt nervous. In the end, I almost left the paper undone. After the exam. I ran to the toilet, took out the paper and carefully read it from the top. Oh! It was last year's exam paper. I read all the questions but I hadn't read the date.\nThis is a lesson in which I know I have to put my feet on the ground. I regretted doing such a silly thing. After that, I told my teacher the truth and I promised to be honest. From then on, I worked harder than ever before.", "id": "middle5252.txt"}
