When I made my first visit to the United States, I was sure I could have a nice and easy holiday without any language problem. But how wrong I was!\nAt the American airport, I was looking for a public telephone to tell my friend Danny that I had arrived. An American asked if he could help me. \"Yes,\" I said, \"I want to give my friend a ring.\"\n\"Well, that's nice. Are you getting married?\" he asked.\n\"No,\" I replied, \"I just want to tell him I have arrived.\"\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"there is a phone downstairs on the first floor.\"\n\"But we're on the first floor now,\" I said.\n\"Well, I don't know what you are talking about. Maybe you aren't feeling too well after your journey,\" he said. \"Just go and wash up, and you will feel a lot better.\" And he went off, leaving me wondering where on earth I was: At home we wash up after a meal to get the cups and plates clean. How can I wash up at an airport?\nAt last we did meet. Danny explained the misunderstanding: Americans say \"to give someone a call\", but we English say \"to give somebody a ring\". When we say \"to wash your hands\", they say \"to wash up\". And Englishmen start numbering from the ground floor so the first floor is the second for Americans.", "id": "middle3582.txt"}
