The minister brought us the money for the poor family , so we must be poor , I thought . I didn't like being poor . Everyone there probably already knew we were poor ! I thought about school . I was in the ninth grade and at the top of my class over 100 students . I wondered if the kids at school knew that we were poor .\nWe sat in silence for a long time . Then it got dark , and we went to bed . All that week ,we girls went to school and came home , and no one talked much . Finally , on Saturday , Mom asked us what we wanted to do with the money . What did poor people do with the money ? We didn't know . We didn't want to go to the church on Sunday , but mom said we had to . Although it was a sunny day , we didn't talk on the way . Mom started to sing , but no one joined in .\nAt church we had a speaker . He talked about how churches in Africa built schools and houses for the poor people , but they needed more money to buy foods . The speaker said ,\" Can't we all give away some money to help those poor people ?\" We looked at each other and smiled for the first time in a week .\nMom reached into her purse and pulled out the envelope . She passed it to Darlene , Darlene gave it to me , and I put it into the offering .\nWhen the offering was counted , the minister _ that it was a little over 500 dollars . The speaker was excited . He hadn't expected such a large offering from our small church . He said ,\" You must have some rich people in this church .\" Suddenly it struck us ! We had given 420dollars of that \"  little over 500 dollars  .\"\nWe were the rich family in the church ! Hadn't the speaker said so ? From that day on , I've never been poor again .", "id": "middle3541.txt"}
