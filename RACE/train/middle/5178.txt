Although he had car and house payments in his head, he still decided to return all of the money to the previous owner of the house,Mr. Williams. Would you have done the same?\nJust hours after he had bought the house,Patrick came into the small house,where he was planning to lay out his tools and hang things up. He looked up and noticed a little hole in the wall. He didn't know what it was inside, so he walked towards the wall. It was very dark inside,but an old box caught his eye.\n\"I caught the thing,it was heavy. I thought it might be some pieces of wood.\" he said. Actually it was not. It was filled with lots of dollar bills. But he and his wife knew they had to return the money to Mr. Williams.\n\"I've got two boys and we teach them to be honest and to do what is right. I knew this was a teachable moment that I would never get back again.\" Patrick said to his wife. \"So I thought we would do something honest with it. It's been a great thing for us and our kids.\"", "id": "middle5178.txt"}
