Every evening we get into homework battles  . When she get home, homework is the last thing she likes to do. I think she should do her homework just after school. But she thinks she should have some time to rest and play first. When Maria does her homework, she wants me to help her. I don't want to help, because I think my daughter should do her homework by herself. And most of the time, I have to do other things.\nChildren these days have much more homework than we did, and some of it is really difficult for them. As you can see, I'm really worried about homework and I really don't know what I should do. Any ideas ? Help me!", "id": "middle1007.txt"}
