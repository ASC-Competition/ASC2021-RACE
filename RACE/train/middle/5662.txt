First, get or borrow a dog! Walk him several times a day! Americans love dogs and cats and usually stop to talk to anyone with a dog. Then, try to eat in a restaurant. People generally share the same table and will sometimes talk to you if they see you are new there. Next, take your dirty clothes to a laundry ! It takes about an hour to wash and dry them and people there often pass the time talking with each other. Always ask for information from a woman if you are a man, and from a man, if you are a woman! Learn to say, \"Please\" \"Thank you\" and \"You're welcome\" and use them all the time!\nThere are some things you shouldn't do. Don't tell the truth when people ask, \"How are you?\" The only answer they want is \"Fine\". Never ask people their age--especially  women! Everyone wants to be young. Don't tell heavy people they are fat. Tell them they are losing weight. Everyone wants to be thin. Don't be late when meeting people! When someone says six o'clock, be sure to be there by six. Americans respect time and want everyone to be \"on time\".", "id": "middle5662.txt"}
