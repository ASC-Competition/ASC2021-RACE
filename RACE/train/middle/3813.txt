People also said they were unable to inquire  through the booking hotline 12306, because it is almost always busy.\nThe China Railway Customer Service Center Website suggested that the online banks didn't return the payment information to the online booking system because of network problems.\nThe online railway booking service was made by the Ministry of Railways on Dec. 21, in order that people can easily buy train tickets during the Spring Festival.", "id": "middle3813.txt"}
