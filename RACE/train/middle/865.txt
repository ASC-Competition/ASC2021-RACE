Which is the way to People's Hospital?\"\n\"Well, I know, you can go along this street, take the second turning on the right, and then take the third turning on your left. It's next to a museum.\"\n\"I'm sorry I can't follow you.\"\n\"Well, I just live near there, and my mother works in that hospital, too. I'm going home now. Will you go with me? I'll take you there.\"\n\"That's great! Thank you very much!\"\n\"Then, let's go to the bus stop. And we'll take the No.12 bus there.\"", "id": "middle865.txt"}
