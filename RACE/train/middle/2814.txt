You have to sit down and write a thank-you note. The word \"thanks\" is very important. We have to use them very often. We say them when someone gives us drink, helps us to pick up things, hands us a letter or lends us a book. It is rude to ask someone to do something without saying \"please\". We have to use it when we ask for something, too. It may be a book or a pencil, more rice or help. We have to use \"please\" to make request pleasant.\nWe have to learn to say \"sorry\", too. When we have hurt someone, we'll have to go up and say we're sorry. When we have forgotten something, we will say \"sorry\". We can make people forget wrong by saying it.\nThese three words are simple but important. Our children must learn to use them. They are pleasing words to use in any language.", "id": "middle2814.txt"}
