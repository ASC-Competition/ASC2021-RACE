We have a day off because of the heavy rain. If you didn't go to school today, what would you do? Why? Linda\nSome advice:\nIf I were you, I would be at home doing something, such as making my bed or helping my mother do some chores. That way, my room would be clean and my parents would be happy. Tina\nI would do what I love! Maybe I would help Mom do some cooking. I would learn how to make dumplings. Kathy\nI don't have enough time in one day to do all the things I want to. People who get bored usually don't have a good imagination  . There are lots of different books to read, websites to surf, people to visit and things to make. June\nWell, if I were you, I would watch a good movie and then take a good nap  . Your brain   and body will then be relaxed and ready for classes the next day. Lisa\n,. (10)", "id": "middle889.txt"}
