More and more people will travel there and watch the games. And it's necessary for the tourists to know the customs there. Here are some tips given by William Hanson, an English manner expert.\n* Afternoon tea.   The traditional view that the British sit down for an afternoon tea is not popular any more. Few people keep the tradition nowadays.\n* Give tips -- but not in a clear way.   The British would like to choose a quiet way of saying \"thank you\" when they get good service. In fact, many British waiters will not mind if you decide not to tip at all.\n* Greeting with a kiss.   The British aren't like their neighbors in France. They do not greet others with a kiss very often. Many people prefer to shake hands or pat  on the back to say \" hello\" .\n* Conversation tips.   If you are not sure what you are talking about, end a sentence with the word \"mate\".\n* Don't talk about money.   According to Hanson, British people don't like to talk about money and it is rude to do so. Especially, never ask anyone how much money he or she makes a month.", "id": "middle4744.txt"}
