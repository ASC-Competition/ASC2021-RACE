The fourth grade wanted the theme to be \"Under the Sea\", but the fifth grade wanted it to be \"Outer Space\". After a long discussion, it was decided to be the former one.\nEveryone had to be on a team, and everyone had to help do something. My team was in charge of special effects. Gary came up with a great idea. He got two big, old fishing nets which were once used by his father when he went fishing on the sea. Gary, Jemma, and I used ropes to tie the nets to the ceiling of the dining hall, and it looked really great. Then we cut out fish shapes from colored paper and stuck _ on the nets.\nEveryone seemed to go to the party in one of three costumes: some kind of fish, a mermaid, or Neptune -- the \"King of the Sea\".\nThe dining hall looked great. Jemma's father had put up colored lights for us. We were feeling proud of our work when the disaster happened. The nets fell down. We were all caught in the fish nets.
