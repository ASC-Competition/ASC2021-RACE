So, if you are advising her, please tell her next year that I do not own a Wii.\nI don't remember asking you for so many pairs of pants, but thank you for giving me the chance to try them on in the front of my whole family. I enjoyed them so much that I continued to wear them, with the tags still on.\nMy mom and the holiday movies are always quick to remind me that Christmas isn't about the presents. It's about togetherness. But without the presents, there's nothing to do to fill up this long, long day. So I think Christmas is about the presents, and I'm sure you agree.\nIf you do, I have some suggestions about ways that you could make the present part of the day last longer: using packing tape to wrap presents instead of Scotch tape . It took, like, ten minutes to open just one present.\nMy final suggestion is pretty simple: more presents! If it took the whole day to open all of the presents, then I wouldn't have that terrible time, because my mom says it's wrong to go play video games in my room, but there's nothing else to do outside of my room.\nAnyway, thank you again and I look forward to seeing you next Thanksgiving. It's an iTunes gift card for you and hope you like it.\nMerry Christmas!", "id": "middle5090.txt"}
