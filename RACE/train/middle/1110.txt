Today, when we think of western tea culture, we often think of the English and beautiful china tea cups.\nAfternoon tea:\nPeople believe that an English lady, Anna, first introduced the idea of afternoon tea. In the 18thand 19thcenturies, the English ate only two main meals each day, breakfast and a heavy supper that would last for several hours in the evening. As a result, people often got very hungry during the long wait between these two meals. To solve this problem, Anna came up with the clever idea of inviting some friends to join her for an afternoon meal between four and five o'clock. This meal included cakes, sandwiches, and tea was served to wash down the food. In order to make this afternoon meal important, fine china cups, plates, and silver teapots, knives, forks and spoons were used. Soon, afternoon tea parties became popular _ . Today, afternoon tea parties continue to play an important part in the social life in modern Britain.\nWill you come for coffee:\nCoffee also has an important role in British culture. People often use words \"Will you come for coffee?\" to mean \"Would you like to come to my home for a chat?\" Normally, several different drinks such as tea, hot chocolate or a soft drink like orange juice will be served as well as coffee, and you will be asked what you would like. However, you will not normally be offered wine at a \"coffee\" party.\nCoffeehouses and the London Stock Exchange:\nIn the 17thcentury London coffeehouses were busy and noisy places. Businessmen and bankers went to coffeehouses to do their business, as well as to drink coffee. In fact, the London Stock Exchange is believed to be started from these coffeehouses.", "id": "middle1110.txt"}
