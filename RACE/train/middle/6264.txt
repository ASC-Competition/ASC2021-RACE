The animal cried for hours as the farmer tried to think out what to do. Finally, the farmer thought the animal was too old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, so he decided not to save the donkey.\nThe farmer invited his neighbours to help him. They began to shovel  dirt into the well. The donkey cried harder. But a few minutes later, he became quiet. The farmer looked into the well, and was surprised by what he saw.\nWhile every shovelful of dirt hit his back, the donkey would shake it off and take a step on the new layer of dirt. As the farmer's neighbours continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, the donkey would shake it off and take another step up. Soon the donkey stepped up out of the well and ran away, to the surprise of all the neighbours.\nThe lesson we get from this story is that if life shovels some dirt on us, we must get out the well and not let it cover us. We must learn to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping-stone . We can get out of the deepest well by never giving up!", "id": "middle6264.txt"}
