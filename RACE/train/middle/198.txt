She is very outgoing . Who is she? Wang Meng, the Chinese top skater.\nOn the evening of February 26th, 2010, Wang Meng first got to the finishing line in 1 minute and 29.213 seconds in the women's 1000 meters short track speed skating final at the Vancouer Olympic Winter Games . After she succeeded in the 500-meter and 3000-meter races, she won her third gold medal this time. With this one China won four gold medals in the women's short track speed skating. That helped China first win the team gold medal in Winter Olympics history.\nJust before the final race Wang Meng caught a bad cold and coughed terribly. With the words of \"You can, you can do!\" she won at last. She said, \"I really feel these three gold medals belong to my team, to China. It was with the help of my team that I won the prize.\"\nThough Wang Meng is only twenty-four, she has been the most successful Chinese skater. Chinese are proud of her and her team. We hope she will be faster in Sochi Olympics in 2014.", "id": "middle198.txt"}
