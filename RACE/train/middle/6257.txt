His favorite hobby was fishing. But it was several years since he had last gone fishing. He was too busy to get a chance to practice.\nThen one summer he decided to go on vacation to a village where there were a lot of streams . \"I ought to be able to have some good fishing there,\" he said to himself confidently   and made good preparations for fishing.\nThe next morning after he arrived there, he walked to the nearest stream with his fishing rod  . To his surprise, he saw an old man standing beside the water, doing nothing. So he asked him whether it was a private stream. The old man answered that it was not a private stream and everyone could fish there, so David said to him, \" Well, then it won't be fined if I catch some fish here, will it?\"\n\"Oh, no,\" answered the old man. \"It won't be, but it will be a miracle .\"", "id": "middle6257.txt"}
