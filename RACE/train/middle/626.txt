Do you know how it came about?\nThe tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added  hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again.\nSullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags.\nHowever, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea.  This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.", "id": "middle626.txt"}
