He studied it very hard for years. He thought he did it best and it was time for him to go out into the world.\nOne day when he walked through a forest, he saw a target   on a tree, with an arrow right in the center. He went on and found more and more trees with targets and arrows in the center. He was so surprised at this. He wanted to know who did it.\nSoon he came to a farmhouse. An old man told him that he could find the person he wanted by the river. When he got there, he saw a little girl playing with her dog on the bank.\n\"Are you the person who shoots the arrows?\" he asked the girl.\n\"Yes, that's me,\" she replied.\n\"But how can you do that?\" he wondered.\n\"That's easy,\" said the girl happily. \"First shoot an arrow.\" Then draw a target.\"", "id": "middle7089.txt"}
