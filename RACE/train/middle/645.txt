He wouldn't do anything but wanted to get rich.\nIt was a cold morning. It snowed and there was thin ice on the streets. Few people went to buy books and the young man had nothing to do. He hated to read, so he watched the traffic. Suddenly he saw a bag fall off a truck and it landed by the other side of the street.\n\"It is full of expensive things.\" Mike said to himself. \"I have to get it right now, or others will take it away.\"\nHe went out of the bookstore and ran across the street. A driver saw him and began to whistle  , but he didn't hear it and went on running. The man drove to the side, hit a big tree and hurt himself in the accident. Two weeks later, Mike was taken to the court  . A judge asked if he heard the whistle when he was running across the street. He said that something was wrong with his ears and he could hear nothing.\n\"But you heard me this time,\" said the judge.\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. Now I can hear with one ear.\"\n\"Cover   the ear with your hand and listen to me with your deaf   one. Well, can you hear me?\"\n\"No, I can't , sir.\"\n\"You told a lie. There is nothing wrong with either of your ears,\" the judge said.", "id": "middle645.txt"}
