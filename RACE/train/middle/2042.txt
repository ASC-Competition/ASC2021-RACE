One day my mother was cooking in the kitchen and my younger brother was playing near the window. I ran to my mother and said,| \" My brother has fallen from the open window!\" She was very worried about my brother and then I said, \"Don't worry. I'm just joking. \" And my mother shouted at me, \" If you do it again, I'll punish you. \"\nOne day I went swimming with my friends in the sea. I wanted to play a joke on my friends. In the beginning, I went swimming alone, and I called to my friends, \" Help me!\" All my friends came to help me, only to find out that I was joking. But the next time I wasn't joking. I swam in deep water and I was so careless that I was almost drowned . I tried my best to call my friends for help, but this time nobody came to saved  my life. They took me to _ . From then on, I haven't joked on anyone. I think this is the best lesson in my life.", "id": "middle2042.txt"}
