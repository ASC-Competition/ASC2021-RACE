I think we should study ants.\nAnts have an amazing four-part philosophy, and here is the first part:they never give up. That's a good philosophy. If they're headed somewhere and you try to stop them, they'll look for another way. They'll climb over, and they'll climb around.  They keep looking for another way. What a neat philosophy to never quit looking for a way to get where they'd like to go.\nSecond, ants think winter all summer. That's an important view. You can't be so naive   as to think summer will last forever. So ants are gathering their winter food in summer. An ancient story says, \"Don't build your house on the sand in summer.\" There is some reason in what it says. It is important to think ahead. In summer, you've to think about the storm. You've got to think about rocks when you enjoy the sand and sun.\nThe third part of the ant philosophy is that ants think summer all winter. That is so important. During the winter, ants remind themselves, \"This won't last long;we'll soon be out of here.\" And on the first warm day, the ants are out. If it turns cold again, they'll go back, but then they come out again if it is warm. They can't wait to get out.\nAnd here is the last part of the ant philosophy. How much will an ant gather during the summer to prepare for the winter? All that he possibly can. What an incredible   philosophy, the \"all-that-you-possibly-can\" philosophy.\nWhat a great philosophy to have the ant philosophy! Never give up, look ahead, stay active and do all you can.", "id": "middle5719.txt"}
