Lei Feng is one of the most famous role models  in China. He is known for his warm heart and kind deeds . We should learn from him. In honor of this great person, we did lots of kind deeds on March 4. Take a look!\nXu Hanchi, 13:\nI went to a square in a local university with my classmates to do cleaning. We swept off the fallen leaves and picked up rubbish. When we finished, the ground was very clean. Though no one came up to praise us, we still felt very happy. We learned that doing good things itself could make us happy.\nZhu Lingyue, 14:\nMy group cleaned the teachers' office that day. When we got there, we were surprised that the office was not as clean as we expected. How could teachers work in such an untidy  place? We started cleaning quickly. Teachers work really hard and may not have the time to clean their offices. It's great that we can do something to help make them less tired.\nTom Rui, 14:\nWe helped clean the yard in the front of a hospital, but some patients  there left us a very bad impression . They were very impolite and shouted at nurses and doctors. I think nurses and doctors' work is hard. They try their best to help us. We should give them more respect and understanding.", "id": "middle1469.txt"}
