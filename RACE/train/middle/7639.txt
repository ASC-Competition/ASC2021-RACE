There will be more people in the world and most of them will live longer.\nComputer will be much smaller and more useful, and there will be at least one in each home. And computer science will be one of the most important subjects in school then.\nPeople will work fewer hours than they do now, and they will have more free time for sports, watching TV and travel.\nOur food will be different, too. More land  will be used for building new towns and houses for people. So there will be less land for cows and sheep, and meat will be more expensive. Maybe no one will eat it one day. They will eat more fruits and vegetables.\nWork in the future will also be different. Robots will do dangerous and hard work. Because of this, many people will have no jobs to do. This will be a big problem in the future.\n,.", "id": "middle7639.txt"}
