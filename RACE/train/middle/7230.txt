Can you?\"\nAt last they asked a wise tiger, \"Which is better--to be strong or to be quick?\"\nThe tiger said, \"Go across the river and pick the fruit on that tree for me, then I can tell.\"\nSo they went to the river, but the water ran fast and the monkey was afraid.\n\"Get on my back,\" said the elephant proudly, \"I shall carry you.\"\nSoon they crossed the river.
