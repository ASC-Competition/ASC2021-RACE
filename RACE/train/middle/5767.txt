My good friend is Diana. She is a rich and proud   girl. She often thinks that she is too good for anyone.\nOne day after school, I was waiting for Diana when Vivien came up to me. She gave me a cake, I got it. We talked and joked. From then on, I began to spend more time with Vivien than Diana. However, I also began to feel a little uneasy.\nAfter a few days, I went to see Diana with some snacks and at that time Vivien came and sat with me. She gave me a sandwich. She also gave one to Diana, but Diana didn't get it. She walked away. I was angry with Diana for being so rude.\n\"Never mind,\" Vivien said , \" I'm used to   it.\"\nAfter school, I tried to catch up with Diana. When we walked home, I tried to correct her attitude  , but she would not listen to me. She said, \"Go and join your 'dear' Vivien. I know you make new friends and forget the old ones.\"\nFor the next few weeks, we did not talk to each other. Then, one day, Diana came to Vivien and me, saying, \"I'm really sorry about what I did. I'm a spoiled   girl, but I also need good friends just like you. Would you please forgive   me? Vivien and I looked at each other and smiled. From then on, Diana, Vivien and I are best friends.", "id": "middle5767.txt"}
