There is a big dining hall.\nWe have an hour for lunch. We eat lunch and chat there. We can also listen to pop music in the hall. We eat fruit and vegetables every day.\nWe have Maths every day because I think Maths is very interesting to us. I love computers, so we have Computer Studies every day. We wear school uniforms, but we do not wear ties. The classes are quite small. There are 15 students in each class.\nThere is a park on one side of our school and a shopping mall on the other. We have a big library\nlots of useful books. We also have a tennis court and a swimming pool.\nThere are lots of clubs and after-school activities. We only have half an hour of homework every day, and we do not do homework at weekends. Every month, we go on a school trip to a museum or a theater.", "id": "middle8033.txt"}
