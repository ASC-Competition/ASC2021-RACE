Every morning he goes for a walk in the park. And he comes home at 12:30 for his lunch. But today a police car stops at his house at twelve o'clock. Two policemen help him out. One of them says to Mr Brown's daughter,\" The old man can't find his way in the park. He asks us to take him home in the car.\" The daughter thanks the policemen. After they leave, she asks her father, \" Dad, you go to that park every day. But today, you can't find the way. What's wrong with you?\" The old man smiles like a child and says, \" I can find my way home. I don't want to walk home today, you know?\"", "id": "middle3142.txt"}
