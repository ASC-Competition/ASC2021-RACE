I forgot what the argument was about, but I will never forget the lesson I learned that day.\nI thought that I was right and he was wrong - and he thought that I was wrong and he was right. The teacher decided to teach us a very important lesson.\nIn the middle of her desk was a large, round ball. I could clearly see that it was black. She asked the boy what color the ball was. \"White,\" he answered.uShe brought us to the front of the class and asked him to stand on one side of her desk and me on the other.\nI couldn't believe he said the ball was white, when it was obviously   black! Another argument started between us, this time about the color of the ball.\nThe teacher told us to change places and then asked me what color the ball was. I answered: \"White.\"\nIt was a ball with two differently colored sides, and from his side it was white. Only from my side it was black.\nSometimes we need to look at problems from the other person's view in order to truly understand his or her perspective  .", "id": "middle3729.txt"}
