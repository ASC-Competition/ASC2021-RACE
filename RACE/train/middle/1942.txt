I was a young reporter for the Daily Journal in San Francisco. Our office wasn't far from Chinatown. I usually managed to arrange my time so that I could go there at least two or three times a week for a good meal.\nThe first time I ever ate Chinese food I loved it. And since then, it just tastes better and better to me. The first thing I noticed was the fresh tastes of the meat and vegetable.
