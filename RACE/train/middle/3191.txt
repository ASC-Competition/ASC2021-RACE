The latest craze is sometimes a style of clothes or a hairstyle. Sometimes it is a game or a TV programme.\nIn the 20thcentury a lot of crazes started in the USA and then became popular in the USA andthen became popular in other parts of the world. American youth culture has spread through tourism , TV , films, magazines and music videos.\nOne of the biggest crazes was the hula hoop . Hula hoops are not popular now, but in the1950s they were a _ .  An American company called Wham-O started to make plastic hoops toys, and in the USA the company sold 100 million hoops in a year.\nFrisbees were another Wham-O product . Some people say that the idea\nstarted in the factory of the Frisbee Baking Company in Connecticut. Workers there threw metal pans to each other during their breaks. Two businessmen made a plastic type of the flying pans,  and sold their products to Wham-O. They became a big business.\nSo businesses usually help to produce a craze. Yoyos were another example. In the Philippines,  where its name means \"comeback\", the yoyo was a popular toy in the 1920s. But it didn't become a global   craze until an American called Donald Duncan bought the idea and sold it to the world. Around 100 million people bought yoyos in 1962 and 1963.\nMost crazes come and go, but sometimes they survive. When the big skateboard started in California in 1965, many parents and governments said that the boards were dangerous, and they were not allowed in some areas. But the boards became popular again and they are still an important part of youth culture today.", "id": "middle3191.txt"}
