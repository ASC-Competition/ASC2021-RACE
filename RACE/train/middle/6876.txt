They are just the ordinary ones who do the everyday things. They work without the recognition   the famous people get. They are the Olympic volunteers.\nThese people aren't the great stars of sport. They just want to do their part for the Olympics by smiling and helping the Games go smoothly.The stars of the Games are like brightly colored sailboats on the sea, racing through the waves. How lovely to watch them! But the volunteers are the wind, which nobody sees. Without the wind the sailboats would not be able to move and no one would want to watch them. The volunteers breathe   the wind of life into the athletes.\nThe volunteers may never win medals, but they always do their best to encourage the _ , whether the athletes win or lose.Some might think what the volunteers do is boring, hardly worth mentioning  . But in my eyes, they are as important as the champions and the stars. They are just as much heroes, despite   not appearing in newspapers or on TV.\nI truly admire them and I will always cheer for them. They are my Olympic heroes.", "id": "middle6876.txt"}
