In the window of a sports shop I noticed a photo of a group of young people climbing the rock along a canyon . \"That's what I'm going to do next year,\" I said. Suzanne laughed. \"Sure, Mom! Don't forget you're 65 years old. \"\nI didn't feel l was that age! I joined a club and trained weekly. Each day I felt my physical energy increase and, along with it, my confidence. Then Suzanne pointed out, \"It's good, but how can you clear away the fear of height?\" \"I've got it worked out, \" I replied bravely. \"We're going to the indoor climbing center. \"\nWhile I was going up the high wall, I was afraid to look down as if a terrible animal was after me. Some time later, as I reached the ground, I sat down heavily on the floor. Later that night, as I lay in bed, I encouraged myself, \"You've climbed the wall! You'll certainly make it! \"\nWe set off with our packages to the Grand Canyon. When we reached it, I found the canyon was a huge black hole--far deeper than I had imagined.

Two and a half hours later, we returned to the car park at last. I began to shake, one hard step after another.\nGetting onto the bus, I fell into the seat I had left so confidently a lifetime before. Then, while I was in the seat catching my breath, a feeling of happiness spread through me. I had done it, at the age of 66.\n,.", "id": "middle3607.txt"}
