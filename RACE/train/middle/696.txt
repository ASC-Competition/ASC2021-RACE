Birthday kids can donate a book. The headmaster of their school will then read it to their class. The headmaster also hands out birthday certificates , special pencils, and makes sure the kids' names are read out in the school's morning news.\nParents can send stickers , pencils and other things to students. None of the things can be food. If a child donates jump ropes or other sports equipment, that child may get his or her name on a certificate. It will then be displayed at school.\nArchisha really misses cupcakes, especially those her mother used to make for her kindergarten class, but her school's way is fun, too. \"I like both ways,\" she said.\nThe headmaster says it's important that the school should be not only teaching, but offering healthy choices to kids. \"There is a better life without cupcakes. If you eat a cupcake, then it's gone in two seconds, but a book lasts a lifetime. The sports equipment lasts, and the kids can use it day after day.\"", "id": "middle696.txt"}
