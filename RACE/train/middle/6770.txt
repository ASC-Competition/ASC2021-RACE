But some of them have some wrong ideas about it.\nA plate of chicken is a good meal before games because it has much energy.\nIn fact, the best meal before games should have carbohydrates . Foods like potatoes, bread, bananas are rich in it, chicken and meat are not. Carbohydrates are the best and most easily used forms of energy. The energy that you get for today's game is from what you ate yesterday.\nThe best time to exercise is early in the morning.\nMorning is a good time to exercise, but it may not be suitable for you. If an afternoon or evening period suits you, and you enjoy the feeling of getting healthier, you can choose any time to exercise. There is no fixed time for you to exercise.\nIf you drink water when you exercise, you'll get headaches and feel tired.\nThe fact is that you must have some water during breaks when you exercise. And after exercising, you must have enough water. If you don't drink enough water, then you'll probably get headaches and feel tired.\nExercising the same body part every day is the fastest way to improve strength.\nFalse! Exercising the same body part every day is the fastest way to cause problems. To improve strength, you want to work your muscles  hard, but then you need to give those muscles a day of rest. Too much exercise can cause serious problems to muscles.\nGirls who do strength training will make their muscles big.\nWrong! We usually connect those big muscles with bodybuilders , but girls don't have enough male hormone  to make their muscles big like men. Strength training is a good way to make their muscles strong for girls.", "id": "middle6770.txt"}
