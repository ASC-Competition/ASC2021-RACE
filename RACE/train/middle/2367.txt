Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake.\nWhen his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a perch . The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. Then the father lit a match  and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M.--- two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy.\n\"You'll have to put it back, son,\" he said.\n\"Dad!\" cried the boy.\n\"There will be other fish,\" said his father.\n\"Not as big as this one,\" cried the boy.\nHe looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could know everything by his father's clear voice that the decision could not be changed. He slowly worked the hook  out of the lip of the huge bass and lowered it into the black water.\nThe creature swished its powerful body and disappeared. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish.\nThat was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's cabin is still there on the island in the middle of the lake. He takes his own son and daughters fishing from the same dock.\nHe was right. He has never again caught such a magnificent fish as the one he landed that night long ago. But he does see that same fish---again and again---every time he comes up against a question of ethics .", "id": "middle2367.txt"}
