The road was strange to him, so he traveled very slowly. When the night fell, he stopped at a nice roadside inn for accommodation .The innkeeper welcomed him.\nA fine supper was prepared. The innkeeper talked about the weather, the roads, the crops. However, his guest ate silently. Next morning after breakfast, Mr. Randolph paid his bill and was ready for his journey. Leading his horse to the door, the innkeeper said, \"Which way will you travel, sir?\" Mr. Randolph looked at him and answered, \"I've paid you my bill. Should I pay you anything more? I travel the way I wish to go.\"\nBut not far from the inn, to his surprise, there were two ways. He searched for a while but there was no sign to help him. The innkeeper was still standing by the door. He called to him: \"My friend, which road leads to Lynchburg?\" The innkeeper answered, \"Sir, you have paid your bill and don't owe  me a cent. Travel the way you wish to go. Good-bye!\"\nAs bad luck would have it, Mr. Randolph took the wrong road. Though out of his way, he lost much time, all because of his rudeness.", "id": "middle4779.txt"}
