Even if that's an overstatement  , it's close to the truth. Scientists say teens should sleep nine hours each night. But that's hard. Some are even \"pulling all-nighters\"  . These students must hand in their homework the next day but they haven't done it. In the morning they don't look healthy and you can tell who's been doing it. One of my classmates did a survey on the topic. She found that most kids pull all-nighters to finish homework, but some do it for other reasons, such as playing computer games!\nMaybe our lack  of sleep is because of laziness -- I think I'm a rather lazy student -- or maybe it's because we have too much to do in American high schools. I usually go to bed around midnight. If I stayed up past 1:30 am, I wouldn't get any work done. I'd be falling asleep at my computer. My classes begin at 7:30 am. I'm partly awake in my first class. By the second, I'm a little sleepy. By my third class, I'm sleepy. By midday I'm finally fully awake. But by 3:00 pm, I'm slowing down again. Yet I get more sleep than usual students.\nMost American high schools seem to have a similar  problem with sleepy students. High school classes start at 7:30 am, so students have to get up one and a half hours before that to get ready and catch the bus. It's believed that lack of sleep can be bad for both grades and health. Some schools are paying attention. Classes in those schools start at 8:30 am.", "id": "middle7982.txt"}
