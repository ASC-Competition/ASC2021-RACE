It was a story about a former astronaut whose body was rebuilt by using artificial   parts after he nearly died. Now, a team of engineers has made a robot by using artificial organs , limbs and other body parts that comes close to a true \"bionic man\".\nThe parts come from 17 manufacturers   around the world. \"This is the first time they've been assembled   together,\" says Richard Walker, the director of a robot company. \"It's an attempt to show the development of medical science,\" he says.\nWalker says the robot has about 60 to 70 percent of the function  of a human. It stands six-and-a half feet tall and can step, sit and stand with the help of a walking machine. This kind of machine is used by people who have lost the ability to walk. It also has a functioning heart that beats and circulates artificial blood . Its blood carries oxygen just like human blood.\nAlthough the parts are used in the robot work, there is a long way to go. There are some key parts missing. There's no liver, skin or brain for the robot.", "id": "middle6857.txt"}
