He made it just the right size to fill the space between the two windows. When I got home that evening, John was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill for his job. My wife said to me quietly, \"That's his ninth cup of tea today.\" But she said in a loud voice, \"It's a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?\" \"I'll decide about that when I see the bill.\" I said. John laughed and gave me his bill.\nIt said:\nOne dining table                                   10thNovember,2014\nCost of wood                    $17.00\nPaint                                            $1.50\nWork,8 hour( $1.00 an hour)            $ 8.00\nTotal                                            $ 36.50\nWhen I was looking at the bill,John said,\"It's been a fine day,hasn't it? Quite sunny.\"\n\"Yes,\" I said.\"I'm glad it's only the 10thof November.\"\n\"Me too.\" said John, \"You wait--it'll be a lot colder by the end of the month.\"\n\"Yes, colder--and more expensive! Dining tables will be $20 more expensive on November 30th, won't they, John?\"\nJohn looked hard at me for half a minute. I gave his bill back to him.\n\"If it isn't too much trouble, John,\" I said,\"please add it up again. You can forget the date...\"\nI paid him $26.50 and he was happy to get it.", "id": "middle4867.txt"}
