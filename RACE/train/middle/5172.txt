During that time, I helped her do some housework and buy some food.\nAfter the first week, I noticed that the food was eaten up very quickly. Then I began keeping an eye on my mum. To my surprise, I found that she would put some of the food into a paper bag and go out with it at about nine every morning. And finally, I decided to follow her. I saw her taking the food to the street children. She would also spend a lot of time talking and playing with them.\nOne day, I talked to a neighbour and found out that my mum was well-known in the area. The children were very friendly with her and even thought of her as their own mother. Then it hit me - why wouldn't she want to tell me about it? Was she worried that I would stop buying food if I found out?\nWhen my mum got home, I gave her a big hug  .I told her she didn't need to keep it a secret from me. And she told me something about the children. Some of them lived with an old lady in a small house. Others slept on the street. For years, she was helping the poor street children by giving them food. After she told me everything, I was so moved by how selfless   she was. She helped others in need. As her son, I was so proud of my mum.\nI continued to buy food for my mum after that. But I always added one more bag for her other children.", "id": "middle5172.txt"}
