She was happy to get a seat by herself. Just then, an air hostess came up to her and asked. \"Would you mind changing your seat? A man would like to sit with his wife.\" The only available  seat was next to a girl with her arms broken, a black-and-blue face, and a sad expression . \"I don't want to sit there,\" Mary thought at once. But then a soft voice inside spoke, \"She needs help.\" Finally, Mary moved to that seat.\nThe girl was named Emily. She had been in a car accident and now was on her way for treatment.\nWhen the snacks and juice arrived, Mary realized that Emily could not feed herself. Mary thought about offering to feed her but she hesitated , as it seemed too impolite to offer such a help to a stranger. But then Mary realized that Emily's need was more important. Mary offered to help her eat. Although Emily was uncomfortable to accept, _ . They became closer and closer in a short time. By the end of the five-hour trip, Mary's heart had warmed, and the time was really better spent than if she had just sat by herself.\nMary was very glad that she sat next to Emily and fed her. Love sometimes goes beyond  human boundaries and removes the fears that keep people away. When we reach our hands to help another, we get to live in a larger and more pleasant world.", "id": "middle4161.txt"}
