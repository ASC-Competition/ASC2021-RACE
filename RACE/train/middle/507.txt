In line there were two people before me. A little boy was buying some rather strange clothes. He chatted with anyone who was interested in the clothes and soon we learnt that he was going to a kindergarten  party. He had done a great job of putting together interesting costumes.\nI noticed that the little boy was paying mostly with change . It seemed that he had robbed his pig bank  to do this shopping. However, the cashier told him he was short after counting all the money. The boy thought for a moment and said, \"Please keep the shirt and I will come back with more money. \"\nIt was clear that he had already used all the money he had and he was $ 8.00 short. The lady in front of me said, \"Well, I could pay half of that. \"I told the boy that I could pay the other half. We dug into our handbags. However, both of us only had ten-dollar bills  and we needed the cashier to get the change for us. Other shoppers began digging into their pockets to find some change. It was amazing and touching as all these strangers seemed to react  with the same mind. All wanted to be of help. Within minutes the cashier said, \"I have too much money.\" The cashier didn't need our ten-dollar bills. Then the lady in front of me, who had been the first to offer help, said, \"Wait! I didn't even get a chance to give anything!\"\nI smiled at her and said, \"You did your share, because it was your idea and you started all this. \" The little boy smiled and thanked us. We wished him the best and he left. I was left with a good feeling. I had seen the love and goodness of others all around me. The woman in front of me smiled and said, \"It sure feels good to give, doesn't it?\" I smiled back and said, \"Yes !\"", "id": "middle507.txt"}
