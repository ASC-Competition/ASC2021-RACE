It describes skyscrapers that are much taller than today's buildings, underwater \"bubble\" cities and holidays in space. The report is from a company. It asked experts   on space and architecture, as well as city planners, to give their ideas on the life in 2116. They said the way we live, work and play will be totally different to how we do these things today. The experts used the Internet as an example. They said that 25 years ago, people could not imagine how the Internet and smartphones would change our lives. The Internet has completely changed the way we communicate, learn and do daily things. The experts said the changes in the next century would be even more unbelievable.\nResearchers questioned 2,000 adults about the prediction   they thought were most likely   to happen in the future. They predicted that in the future, few people will go to an office but will work from home and have work meetings online. People will have highly developed 3-D printers that will let you download   a design for furniture or a food recipe and then \"print\" the sofa, table or pizza at home. There will also be less need for visits to the doctor. We will all have a home health instrument that will tell us what the problem is and give us treatment. We will also be going into space for holidays and to get resources that we have used up on Earth. A prediction that is missing is whether people will still need to study English.\n,A, B, C, D,.", "id": "middle7883.txt"}
