Everyone is getting unwell.\"\nThis may sound like something someone would say today. But in fact, an unknown person who lived in Rome in AD  53 wrote it.\nWe all love new inventions. They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives. But have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives?\nPicture this. You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a QQ message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the television is getting louder and louder. Suddenly the computer goes blank and you lose all your work. Now you have to stay up all night to get it done. How happy do you feel?\nInventions have speeded up our lives so much that they often leave up feeling stressed and tired. Why do you think people who live far away from noisy cities, who have no telephones, no cars, not even any electricity  often seem to be happier? Perhaps because they live simpler lives.\nOne family in the UK went \"back in time\" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons Benjamin, 10 and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave , computer or mobile phones.\nThe grandmother, Lyn, said, \"The more things you have, the more difficult life becomes.\" The boys said they fought less. Probably, they said, because there was less to fight over, such as their computer. Benjamin also noticed that his grandmother had changed from being a \"trendy , beer-drinking granny\", to one who cooked things.", "id": "middle2714.txt"}
