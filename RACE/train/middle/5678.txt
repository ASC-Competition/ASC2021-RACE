A player likes the opponent  to play as well as he does. But it was holiday time and I agreed to play. We placed the board  in the garden. The game began .I hoped it would be quick-----and so it was.\"\n\"I soon knew that David Prang was no learner.After ten minutes his sister came outside and began to play tennis against in our game. He moved a piece  without care. I gave my attention to the board.\"\n\"Call me when you are ready,Mr Watson,\"he said.\n\"When I was ready?\" I looked up. He had gone off to play with his sister,I studied the board-----and found I was driven into a corner. So it went on with David;a quick move,then tennis,back to the board,then back to his sister.My difficult condition became impossible to change. I was beaten,oh,so easily,by a ten-year-old chess player. He was the winner--in twenty-eight minutes.\"\n\"David Prang:a name to remember.I had a chance to use his game today and it won this cup for me. To him,of course,it'sonly one of a hundred,or perhaps a thousand,winning games.\"", "id": "middle5678.txt"}
