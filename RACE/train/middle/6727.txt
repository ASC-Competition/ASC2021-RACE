One day he went to a wise man to ask how to become rich. The wise man said, \"Young man, you are already rich now.\"\n\"But where is my wealth?\" the young man asked.\n\"It is with you. Your eyes are your wealth. You use them to see this world. You use them to see all the beautiful things in this world. Your hands are your wealth. You can use them to work. You can use them to hug your beloved ones. Your legs are your wealth. You can go to any place...\" the wise man said.\n\"You call these wealth? But everyone has them,\" the young man said.\n\"These are wealth. What you have now is not what someone else can luckily have. Would you like to give your eyes to me? I'd like to give you a lot of money to exchange for them,\" the wise man said.\n\"No, I'm not going to do so! My eyes are important to me!\" the young man said.\nEveryone is rich. We should treasure our wealth, and take care of it. We should not overuse it because once it is gone, it is gone forever. Remember it is our wealth that we do not want to lose.", "id": "middle6727.txt"}
