He was about to start the car when a gunman jumped up from the back seat. He held a gun to Mr. Smith's head. \"Drive me to Paris!\" he shouted.\n\"All right\", Mr. Smith answered. He started the engine, pulled away from the side of the street and drove down. Being eighty-one years old, he knew he could not fight the gunman. He knew he needed help. Where were the police? As he drove through a crossing, he looked up and down the side streets, hoping to meet a police car. But he could see nothing. \"Just my luck,\" he thought, \"If I was driving too fast, there would be a police car on every corner.\"\nSuddenly he pushed his foot down on the accelerator , and the car ran much faster. \"What are you doing?\" shouted the gunman. \"Keeping off the police,\" Mr. Smith answered. \"I thought I saw a police car back there.\"\nHe ran lights, drove the wrong way on one-way streets. On two-way streets he drove on the wrong side of the road. Not one policeman saw him. Again Mr. Smith's plan was not working. He had to try a new plan. He turned a corner and saw the police station in front. Then he drove his car as fast as he could towards the police gate. The car hit a police motorbike down and stopped. Mr. Smith shouted, \"Help! Help!\" Then he reached back to grab  the man's gun. At the same time the policeman heard the noise and quickly caught the gunman.", "id": "middle4837.txt"}
