On the day of his birthday, he played a game of tennis and went for a long walk. A few days later a radio reporter came to his house and asked him if he had any \"secrets of long life\". This is what Mr. Gale said, \"No, I don't know any secrets like that, but there are a few simple rules of good life. I've always kept them all my life. The first is this: Don't listen to those fools who tell you to give up all the pleasures of life! The second is to enjoy all the pleasures of life in moderation . For example, I've always smoked a few good cigars every day. Not many, mind you! Only two or three! I've always also drunk a little good wine with my meals, perhaps two or three glasses. The third rule is to take a little exercise every day. I've taken a little and on Saturdays I've played a little tennis or golf.\"", "id": "middle126.txt"}
