So I often listen to my favourite music after supper.\nSinging Bird: I like music, too. But I only listen to Chinese songs. I also like drawing. Maybe I can be a great painter   when I grow up. I also like reading. Reading makes me clever.\nJumping Tiger: I don't like music or drawing. They are a waste  of time, I think. I am a good basketball player. I can help our school team win. Don't you think it's cool?\nRunning football: I am not a good basketball player. But I play football well. Playing football makes me strong. I feel great when I am on the football field. I spend half an hour a day playing football.\nSwimming Cat: I am not like many other boys. I don't like sports very much. I just think reading is my favourite. I can learn a lot from books. I spend an hour reading books every day.", "id": "middle3899.txt"}
