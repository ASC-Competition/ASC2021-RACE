But brother and sister, Sarah and Bobby Green, became young millionaires when they opened a chain of American-style coffee shops in the UK.\nHaving the idea: It started when Sarah took a weekend trip to New York to visit her brother Bobby. One evening, in a Thai restaurant, Sarah told Bobby how much she wished she could buy American-style coffee in London. Bobby suggested they started their own coffee shop. Sarah fell in love with the idea.\nDoing the Research: Back in London, she spent a whole day on the London subway, getting off the train at different stations to taste the coffee. \"It was terrible, and I knew there was a gap   in the market.\" In 1995, they opened their first Coffee Republic shop in central London.\nMaking it work: The first year was very difficult. British people were not used to the names of American coffees, like latte and macchiato. But being successful was their dream and they were not going to give up. Today, there are over 100 Coffee Republic shops all over the country and the company has PS30 million a year.\nAdvice for others: Sarah has now written a best-selling book about their experience, calledAnyone Can Do It ! She hopes it will help other young people to start their own businesses. She says, \"If you think you have the energy, then get out and follow your dream.\"", "id": "middle389.txt"}
