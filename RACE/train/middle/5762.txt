But what do you think of your school? What is your ideal school like? Here is some designing from four children in different countries.\nI'm Ma from China. My dream school has a swimming pool and two football fields. It also has a cinema, a restaurant and a shopping centre. Now my school has none of these and I think there should be more enjoyable things for pupils to do while they are studying.\nI am Sonia from Italy. I'd like a room. We can go and play computer games and chat with friends there. Some older pupils in the school have this but I think there should be a place for everyone to go when they want to switch  from the lessons.\nI am Richard from the USA. I think it would be great to have a three days' holiday every week. We could have a long holiday. What fun! I also think school should start at ten o'clock, and finish at three o'clock in the afternoon.\nI am Rebecca from Australia. My dream school would be big and roomy with a computer for every person in the school. I'd also like to have a music room. We can go and play instruments  when we want.", "id": "middle5762.txt"}
