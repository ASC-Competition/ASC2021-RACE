The letter said that the music department   of the school was in big trouble. The students had to pass a test, or the department would be closed.\nThe test came on Saturday. The nervous students were required to play a piece of music created by Richard Strauss. And they had to sing the words to the music -- German words! There were also other difficult tasks. One student had to sing Mary Had A Little Lamb, a children's song, in an operatic   voice.\nAfter three hours of testing, the students all waited for the results. They met some students from the New Jersey Youth Orchestra   while waiting. They had the same test and only got a passing grade.\nThe worried New Milford High School students started to realize they had no chance. \"I thought it was over,\" said Bryan Olsen-Santana. \"The girl next to me was crying. I felt bad for her. I felt bad for myself, too, because music is everything to me.\"\nBut then the headmaster came and told them something very dramatic  , \"Someone has played a joke on you!\"\nWhat was going on?\nThe test was part of a new reality TV show called \"Schooled\". The students' parents, the school and a TV network had made it together. Everything was _ . The \"students from New Jersey Youth Orchestra\" were students from another school. There were hidden cameras.\nThe students' parents were hiding as they watched.\nAs a reward for putting up with the joke, the students got gifts: MP3 players, digital cameras and school supplies  . They were all from the show's sponsor  .", "id": "middle7771.txt"}
