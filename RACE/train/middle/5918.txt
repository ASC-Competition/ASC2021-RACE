On a trekking vacation, you walk for long distances through the mountains. There are very few roads in Nepal, so trekking is the best way to travel. It's best if you hire  a guide . The guides know the best paths to take and they also help trekkers with their bags. Our guide even cooked our food for us. Every day, we trekked for about four hours before lunch, and about two hours in the afternoon. At the end of the day's trek, we sat around a campfire and talked about the things we saw. Then we went to sleep in large tents. Every morning, our guide brought breakfast to our tent. It was great. At the end of the trip, I didn't want to go home!", "id": "middle5918.txt"}
