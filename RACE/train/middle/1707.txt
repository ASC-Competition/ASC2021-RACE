The secretary could tell in a moment that such country people had no business at Harvard. She frowned . \"We want to see the president,\" the man said softly. \"He'll be busy all day,\" the secretary said coldly. \"We'll wait,\" the lady replied.\nFor hours, the secretary didn't talk to them, hoping that the couple would finally become tired and go away. They didn't. And the secretary finally decided to disturb the president. \"Maybe if they just see you for a few minutes, they'll leave,\" she told him. He frowned too. Someone of his importance obviously didn't have the time to spend with them.\nThe president walked toward them unwillingly. The lady told him, \"We had a son that attended Harvard for one year. He loved Harvard, and was very happy here. But he was accidentally killed. And my husband and I would like to set up a memorial  to him somewhere on campus. \" The president was so surprised that he shouted sharply, \"We can't put up a statue  for every person who attended Harvard and died. This place would look like a cemetery  .\n\"Oh, no\" the lady explained, \"We don't want to build a statue. We thought we would give a building to Harvard.\" The president rolled his eyes. He glanced at their plain clothes, and said with surprise, \"A building! Do you have any idea how much a building costs? We have over seven and a half million dollars in the physical buildings here at Harvard.\"\nFor a moment the lady was silent. The president was pleased. He could get rid of them now. The lady turned to her husband and said quietly. \"Is that all it costs to start a university? Why don't we just start our own?\" Her husband nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Leland Stanford walked away, traveling to Palo Alto, California where they set up the university with their name, Stanford University, a memorial to a son that Harvard no longer cared about.", "id": "middle1707.txt"}
