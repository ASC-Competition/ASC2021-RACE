Here is some advice for you:\nBefore an earthquake   It is necessary to prepare yourself and your family. All family members should know how to turn off gas, water and electricity and know useful telephone numbers ( doctor, hospital, police and 119 etc.). Never put heavy things over beds.\nDuring an earthquake   It is important for each of you to stay calm. If you are indoors, quickly move to a safe place in the room such as under a strong desk or table. The purpose is to protect yourself from falling things. Stay away from windows, large mirrors, heavy fumiture and so on. If you are cooking, turn off the gas. If you are outdoors, move to an open area like a playground. Move away from buildings, bridges and trees. If you are driving, stop the car as soon as possible, staying away from bridges and tall buildings, stay in your car.\nAfter an earthquake  ONCE the shaking has stopped, DO NOT run out of the building at once. It is better to wait and leave when it is safe. Check around you and help the people who are in trouble. If your building is badly broken, you should leave it. If you smell or hear gas, get everyone outside and open windows and doors. If you can do it safely, turn off the gas. Report it to the gas company.", "id": "middle2888.txt"}
