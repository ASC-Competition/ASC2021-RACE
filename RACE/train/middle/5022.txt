The Nolans are among volunteers who walk Cape Cod's beaches during November and December to search for turtles who are often cold and trapped and seem dead--turtles whose lives they may be able to save.\nMax and his mother and the other volunteers do an important job. All sea turtles are threatened or endangered. Among them Kemp's ridleys are the most endangered.
