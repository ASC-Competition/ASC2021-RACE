One of the major traffic light had gone out , and a police officer was standing in the middle of around twenty lanes of very busy traffic . The fact was that he had no hat or shade to shield him from the burning sun but , he was upbeat and doing a fabulous job .\nI saw a drugstore on the comer , and while I was there , I wanted so badly to get some water for the officer ! I had some hesitation , though , as it was a little out of my comfort zone to communicate with a stranger in this way .\nI discussed , struggled , left , drove part-way home , turned around , went back to the drugstore , got water , and then found myself thinking about how to hand it to him in the busy crossing . I knew that he might not be able to take it - he wouldn't have hands to hold it since he was busy making motions to direct the traffic - but I had to try .\nI drove into the crossing , rolled down my windows as I passed the officer , and gave him the bottle of water . Though he wasn't able to take the bottle , he broke into a smile and said , \" Thank you . \"\nI drove home , feeling better for having persisted . And I was even inspired to call the station that afternoon to make sure they knew what a great job he did that day . It felt good to spread the positivity , and it was the least I could do .", "id": "middle5567.txt"}
