This makes sure students won't fall over on the slippery floors and keeps the schools clean. Gum chewing is not allowed in many USA school buildings, as it is difficult to clean up. And if students chew gum in class, they may not focus on study.\nUK: Strange hairstyles are not allowed in some British schools.

But they were not accepted by their school after that because the school said the rules changed since then.", "id": "middle1860.txt"}
