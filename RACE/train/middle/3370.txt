It has the word \"and\" five times, without any words in between? There is one at the end of this story.\nThere was an inn. It was called \"The Horse and Cart\". Many people came to have a drink and chat with each other after work. It had a sign outside it, and there was a horse, a cart and some letters in the sign. But the sign was getting old, so the owner of the inn decided to have a new one. He went to a painter and asked him to draw one and write \"The Horse and Cart\" on it in large letters.\nA few days later, he went to see how the painter was getting on. He liked the picture of the horse and cart very much, but he did not like the writing at all. He said to the painter, \"No, no! There's too much room between HORSE and AND and AND and CART!\"", "id": "middle3370.txt"}
