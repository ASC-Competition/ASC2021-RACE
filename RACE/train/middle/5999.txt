I came to New York in 1956. At first, I held several jobs to earn a few dollars. Later, to live a better life, I bought my own taxi car. Till now, I've been in the taxi car business for thirty-five years. I know there is a lot about taxi drivers that is not so good. Because of this, people get the wrong impression  that they are bad.\nIn fact, taxi drivers are just like other honest people. You can read in the papers almost every week where a taxi driver turns in money or jewels people leave in their cars. One time in Brooklyn, I found a ring in my car. I remembered helping a lady with a lot of bags that day, so I went back to the store where I had dropped her off. It took me almost two days to look for her in order to return the ring. I didn't get as much as \"Thank you.\" Still, I felt good because I had done what was right.\nIn all my years of driving a taxi car, I have never had any trouble with the public because I always try to be nice to everyone. I try to be honest toward others. I have been trying this for a long time, and the longer I try, the easier it gets.\nI believe honesty is one of the greatest gifts there is. It's something that makes a man a good guy. This is also my way to live by.", "id": "middle5999.txt"}
