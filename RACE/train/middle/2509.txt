She used a method known as a kangaroo care. The child, named Jamie ,was born after only 27 weeks with his twin sister, Emily, in a hospital in Sydney. Her birth went well ,but his was a different story. The doctor struggled for 20 minutes to save Jamie before announcing him dead.\n\"His little arms and legs were just falling down away from his body.\" Kate Ogg said ,\"I took off my coat and put him on my chest with his head over my arm.\" She and her husband, David ,said to the child as she continued to hold him for nearly 2 hours. During that time, the two-pound baby showed the sign of life. She said , \"I told my mum ,who was there, that he was still alive. Then he held out his hand and grabbed my finger. \"Their tiny baby grew stronger and stronger in his mother's arms, and their final goodbye turned into a hello.\nThe doctor at first ignored the baby's movements, but when he put the stethoscope to his chest, his mouth was wide open and he said ,\"It's my fault, It's a miracle( ).\n\"The kangaroo care helps the baby keep body warmth\" Dr Pinchi Srinivasan said, \"It also regulates  heartbeat and breathing rates and is believed to help weight gain and improve  sleeping habits. Fathers can also use kangaroo care. The key to the method is skin-to-skin contact.\"\nThe practice began in less developed nations. It has become a recognized pracitce in helping premature babies. The techniques is good for babies, and is used in many baby care centers.", "id": "middle2509.txt"}
