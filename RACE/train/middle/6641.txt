I never read the book, but the title has always stuck with me. I think it was because the title _ I hadn't been taught to be so selfish that I should be focused on only me . I thought I needed to be helping others and, along the way, I would also be helping myself. Now, I realize I should have at least considered learning more about looking out for number one.\nOver 30 years after seeing the book about looking out for number one I'm realizing number one, me, is the person I should be concerned about first. Jeffrey Gitomer asks the question, \"Who is the most important person in the world?\" Most people answer, the customer. He then asks, if there were only two people left in the world, the customer and you, who would you want to survive ? Now the answer is me.\nIt makes me sense that if we can't help ourselves first, we will never be prepared to help others. We all need to learn to control our lives and make the best decisions for ourselves. That will put us in a position to help others in the future . But many of us are slow to understand this.\nIt has been said that happiness will bring success, but success doesn't always bring happiness. We all want to be happy and successful. For some of us can be very happy when our basic needs are met and our family are safe. Others will seek high levels of success thinking that will bring happiness. I'm sure we can think of a person who is very successful, according to the world's standards  , but they don't appear to be happy at all. This is because they have been so busy working for somebody else's goals that they haven't considered their own needs.", "id": "middle6641.txt"}
