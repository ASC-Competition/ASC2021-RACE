He always forgot a lot of things. So his wife always had to say to him, 'Don''t forget this!'\nOne day he went on a long trip alone. Before he left home, his wife said, 'Now you have all these things. They are what you need for your trip. Take care of your things during the trip.' He went to the station, bought a ticket and got on the train with it.\nAbout half an hour later, the conductor began to see the tickets. He came to the old man and said, 'Will you please show me your ticket?' The old man looked for his ticket in all his pockets, but he could not find it. He was very worried. 'I can't find my ticket. I really bought a ticket before I got on the train.' said the old man.\n'I believe you bought a ticket. All right, you don''t have to buy another one, ' said the conductor kindly. ' But how can I know where I'm going? I can't remember my station!' the old man said sadly.", "id": "middle5033.txt"}
