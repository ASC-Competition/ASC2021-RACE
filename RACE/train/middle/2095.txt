I'm writing this letter because I want to let you know that the school year with you was important and special to me. It made a great contribution  to my life.\nI know I was very quiet in your class, and you never said much to me. But you did something that made a big difference in my life. You see, all through my first years in schools. I hated to read. Books were just words that had very little to do with me, and I was bored by them. I'll never forget the first day of Grade Six when you took out a thick book and began to read the story to our class. Your voice seemed to change with the people in the story, and you drew pictures in my mind as you read aloud. Since that day, I couldn't wait until after lunch when you would read to the class. You read us all kinds of wonderful books.\nDuring the summer after my year in your class, I missed hearing the stories you would read. So one day I picked up a book and read it all on my own. I found out that I could make the words interesting, too. Now, I love to read! Thank you for opening the world of books for me.\nYours,\nLinda", "id": "middle2095.txt"}
