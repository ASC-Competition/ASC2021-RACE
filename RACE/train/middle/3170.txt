When I got home that evening, John was drinking a cup of tea and writing out his bill for the job.\nMy wife said to me quietly,\"That's his ninth cup of tea today. \"But she said, in a loud voice,\"It's a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?\"\n\"I'll decide about that when I see the bill. \"I said.\nJohn laughed and gave me his bill for the work. I read:\nOne dining table                        10 November, 1998\nCost of wood                            $17. 00\nPaint                                   $1. 50\nWork, 8 hours ( $1 an hour )            $8. 00\nTotal                                   $36. 50\nWhen I was looking at the bill, John said, \"It's been a nice day, hasn't it?Quite sunny. \"\n\"Yes. \"I said. \" I'm glad it's only the tenth of November. \"\n\"Me, too. \"said John. \"You wait -- it'll be a lot colder by the end of the month. \"\n\"Yes,colder -- and more expensive! A dining table will be $20 more expensive on November 30, won't it, John?\"\nJohn looked hard at me for half a minute. Was there a little smile in his two blue eyes?I gave his bill back to him.\n\"If there isn't too much trouble, John,\" I said,\"please add it up again. You can forget the date...\"\nI paid him $26. 50 and he was happy to get it.", "id": "middle3170.txt"}
