My dream is to be an engineer.Should I give history up?\"\nMaybe you are right. After you leave school, it's necessary for you to understand such things. Please remember that at school, besides getting knowledge, you should pay attention to some other important things.\nFirst, try to find what you are most interested in. At school, you study many subjects. Try to find which you like and which you don't like. This may be helpful to you in the future. Second, maybe you don't like math and you want to drop it. But the logical thinking ability from math can help you solve some problems. At school, you should practice your brain by thinking. Third, you should believe in yourself. Maybe you learn English at school, but you don't need to speak English in your daily life at all. You should think learning English can prove that you have the ability of learning languages. Suppose you go to France one day and find a job there. Then you can tell yourself, \"I can do my job well. At school I learned English well, and now I must be able to learn French well, too.\" But if you have no confidence, what will happen?\nTry to challenge yourself as often as possible. I think many of us like playing computer games. When we fail in a game, we always want to try it again. Why? Because we want to get the highest marks, though it is hard for us to get it. If we want to challenge ourselves, we must face more difficult things and make greatest progress.", "id": "middle4562.txt"}
