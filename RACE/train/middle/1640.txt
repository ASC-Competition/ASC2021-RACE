They stayed in a very large hotel. Their room was on the 45thfloor.\nIn the evening, the three men went to the cinema and came back to the hotel very late.\n\"I'm very sorry,\" said the man of the hotel, \"but our lifts  do not work tonight. If you don't want to walk up to your room, I'll make beds for you in the hall . \"\n\"No, thanks,\" said Tom, \"we don't want to sleep in the hall. We will walk up to the 45thfloor. But I know how to make it easier. On the way to our room, I'll tell you some jokes. Then you, David, will sing us some songs. Then you, John, will tell us some stories, all right?\"\nSo they began to walk upstairs. Tom told them many jokes. David sang them some songs. At last they came to the 34thfloor. They were tired and had a rest.\n\"Well,\" said Tom. \"Now it's your turn, John. After all these jokes and songs, tell us a long and interesting story with a sad ending. \"\n\"OK, I'll tell a sad story,\" said John, \"It's not long but very sad. I forgot to bring the key to our room with me. It's still in the hall. \"", "id": "middle1640.txt"}
