It explains the world and makes our lives easier with technology. One of the most exciting fields in science is artificial intelligence ( AI). This is an area where scientists are working on making machines that think like humans.\nHowever, Professor Stephen Hawking, a well-known British scientist, is not for _ kind of technology. \"The development of artificial intelligence could spell  the end of human\". He said so just after using the machine made for him. As Hawking has a serious illness called ALS, he needs an AI computer to communicate. The computer learns how Hawking thinks and suggests the words he may want to use next.\nThis kind of AI is very useful, but Hawking fears the possibility of making machines that can be smarter than humans. And it's easy to imagine how terrible things may be. We can see on TV some big killer machines that are far cleverer than us. \"Humans can't compete because of their slow biological evolution  \" said Hawking. But no everyone holds the same idea towards AI technology. \"I believe we can make good use of the technology for a long time. It will help us to solve many problems in the future.\" said Rollo Carpenter, CEO of Cleverbot in the UK.\nIn which way do you think AI is heading? Should we be hopeful or fearful?", "id": "middle7189.txt"}
