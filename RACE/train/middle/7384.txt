As I lay there bleeding, I suddenly realized that I might have to live the rest of my life without legs. How depressed I was at that moment! But then I realized that depression won't get my legs back. So I decided not to waste my life feeling depressed. When my parents arrived at the hospital, they stood there quietly, looked so shocked and sad. I told them, \"I've already accepted the fact. Now you also have to get used to this.\"\nEver since then, I often see my friends getting worried about little things: The buses comes late; they get bad grades on the tests and so on. But I just enjoy life.\nI was lucky to realize that it is a waste of energy to pay attention to what you have lost, and that the key to happiness is to take pleasure in what you have. Sounds simple, doesn't it? So why are many people unhappy?\nPeople often think happiness is based on what they achieve. \"My whole life would improve if I had a new car.\" But when they get the car and what happens? For a whole week they are walking on air. Then they go right back to be unhappy.\nHappiness is not a happening; it's a state of mind. Even though you have the whole world and you'll still be unsatisfied. And you have relatively little but feel full of joy. Happiness comes from mastering the art of enjoying and taking pleasure in what you already have.", "id": "middle7384.txt"}
