He comes from a poor family and was in school for only four years. He has to do the hard work, but he hasn't got much money. He likes to watch football matches very much and spends much time on it.\nOne evening there was a big football match on a playground. He borrowed some money from his friend and hurried there. There were a lot of people there. And all the tickets were sold out. He was sorry for it. He saw a pole   outside the playground and climbed up it quickly. A policeman came and said, \"It's dangerous to stay on it! Come down!\" \"Wait a minute, please!\" Henry said and just at that moment the policeman heard cheers in the playground and asked in a hurry, \"Which team has kicked a goal?\" \"Ours!\" \"Wonderful! You can stay there. But take care!\" the policeman said happily and left.\nWhen the match was nearly over, he came again and asked, \"Who's won?\" \"Theirs, 3:2.\" \"Come down,\" said the policeman angrily. \"Such a match isn't worth watching!\" Henry had to come down. But soon they heard cheers again. The policeman said anxiously, \"Climb up and quickly and see who's kicked a goal!\"", "id": "middle5797.txt"}
