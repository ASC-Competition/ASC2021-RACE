He was also a man full of humour. Once, at his 70th birthday party, a friend asked Freud if he could put his work into several words.\"Well,\"said Freud, \"we take the sick out of their trouble and return them to the common suffering.\"\nAs a devoted son, Freud often visited his old mother. His mother usually spent her summer in a small mountain town in Austria. The King Josef usually spent his summer there, too. One day in the summer, a band was playing a lively tune when Freud's mother was sitting at the window and watching the people singing and dancing on Main Street. The old woman had a poor memory. She heard the band playing, but forgot it was the King's birthday. Freud was visiting his mother on her 95th birthday. He told his mother, \"Mama, the band is playing for your birthday.\"She believed him and had a wonderful day.", "id": "middle4397.txt"}
