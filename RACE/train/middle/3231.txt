I'll meet you at  Mcdonald's.\" This means he has agreed that the two will go Dutch, that is, each person pays for himself. He may say \"Oh, no. I want to take you for lunch at Johnson's \" This means the person is to pay the  bill for both of them. Although the other person is pleased with the invitation, there is one reason why he shouldn't accept it by simply saying \"Thank you.\"\nAmerican customs are much the same as those in other parts of the world. American women used to expect men to pay for all the meals. But today, some of them like to. However, if a woman is asked to attend a dinner or a dance outside, the invitaton itself means \"Come as my guest\". So, as you see, it is a polite thing to make the situation clear at the very beginning.", "id": "middle3231.txt"}
