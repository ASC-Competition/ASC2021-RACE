Why can't we raise our head high and believe that we are as beautiful as others? A smile is beautiful on any face,whether fat,oily or hairy.And a kind heart is much more beautiful than a pretty look.\nSo,let's feel grateful that we all have beautiful and healthy bodies that do not need surgeries! Today,I call on you to make an easy change:hold your head high! smile and be kind to others.If you do these,you will be full of confidence ,beauty, and warmth everywhere you go.", "id": "middle2807.txt"}
