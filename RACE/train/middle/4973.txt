So the campaign on school food waste is getting popular across the country. The move is part of a national campaign started by students at different schools.\nAt East China University of Science, students who finish their food in the school dining hall get a special card when they return their plates after meals. Students can collect cards and exchange them for small gifts, such as books, schoolbags, magazines and umbrellas. \"It's been such a surprise,\" said Liang Zhaoyun, 19, a student in Shanghai. \"It has given us one more motivation to eat up our food.\"\n\"The purpose of the campaign is not only to encourage students to finish their food. We hope it can also teach students to choose a more environment-friendly and healthy lifestyle,\" said Tao Siliang from University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\nOther schools also pay attention to the quantity of food. At Nanjing No.9 Middle School, rice is divided into three different-sized bowls that students can choose from according to their own need. \"It's great because I can try different dishes at half price and don't waste so much food,\" said Fan Peng, 15, a student from this middle school.\nWhat if you really can't finish all your food? At Changchun Normal College, they provide a take-away service. \"If you can't finish all your food, you can get a box to take the left food home. Even if you feed the cat, it's not wasted,\" said Zhou Zeyong, a student who learns Chinese education.\n\"I'm happy that we've cut down waste since joining the school 'eat-up' meeting. But some food is poorly cooked, meaning that students are not willing to finish it all. Some schools have taken note of this. So if we hope students try to waste less food, we should also improve the service and keep an eye on the meal quality on weekdays at school. If not, you can't complain students for throwing away much food,\" said Wang Guangji, the head-teacher of Beijing No. 29 Middle School.", "id": "middle4973.txt"}
