He was born in 1832 and died in 1898.\nHe is most famous for writing two children's fantasy books about a young girl called Alice. They were titled Alice's Adventures in Wonderland(1865) and through the looking-Glass(1872).\nHe also wrote two famous poems called \"The Hunting of the Snark\" and \"The Jabberwocky\".
