Every day the farmer got up early to read books.\nOne day the grandson asked, \"Grandpa! I want to read books just like you, but I don't understand them. What are the advantages of reading?\" The grandfather said, \"Take this litter basket to the river and bring me back a basket of water.\" he boy did, but all the water _ before he got back to the house. The grandfather laughed and said, \" You'll have to walk faster next time.\"\nThis time the boy ran faster, but again the basket was empty before he returned home. The boy said, \" See Grandpa, it's useless!\"\nSo you think it is useless?\" the old man said. \"Look at the basket.\"\nThe boy looked at the basket and for the first time he realized that the basket was different. It was clean, inside and out.\n\"That's what happens when you read books. You might not understand or remember everything, but when you read them, you will be changed, inside and out.\"", "id": "middle1034.txt"}
