Luo Yang, 51, the father of China's carrier jet, who devoted his whole life to the aircraft industry, is no doubt one such person.\nLuo was the head of production for the new J-15 fighter. On November 25, he was joining in fighter jet landing exercises for the Liaoning as usual. Shortly after the successful landing of the J-15, Luo experienced a sudden heart attack. He was soon sent to the hospital but the doctors couldn't save his life.\nLuo was given an award for his special contribution to the country by China Central Television on February 19.\nAs general manager of the Shenyang Aircraft Corp, Luo didn't use his power to improve the quality of his life. He gave up the chance to move into a new apartment. His suit was ten years old and his watch strap was faded .All he focused on was the aircraft industry.\nLuo seldom had the time for a good chat with his wife and daughter. He always started work at 6 am and returned home around midnight when they were sleeping.\nWhen devoted to his work, Luo always forgot about everything else. His final days were all spent on the J-15. At one point, he felt unwell, but he didn't leave the carrier or see a doctor.\n\"I spent eight days on the carrier with Luo. He worked all day and night under huge pressure,\" recalled Meng Jun, one of his colleagues .\nLuo's death is a big _ to the country. His example, however, has inspired many people. \"It's a pity Luo Yang died when the aircraft carrier achieved success. It's good to see more young people are entering this career now,\" said Yang Yu, a commentator for China Central Television.", "id": "middle4124.txt"}
