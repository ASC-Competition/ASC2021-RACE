There are three basic questions.\nThe first question is about real English. Li Hao from Hubei wrote, \"I enjoy watching English films and listening to real English songs. But it takes a long time. What do you think?\"\nThis is a great way to learn English! Talk about the film or song with your friends, and guess the meaning of the new words. Just enjoy yourself!\nThe second question is about speaking. Sam, from Suzhou wrote. \"Our school has a foreign teacher. But I'm shy and can't speak to her. What should I do?\"\nWhen I visit China, lots of people in the street say, \"Hello! How are you? Where are you from? Do you like China?\" These are good questions to start a talk. Many people are shy when they speak English, so before you begin, take a deep breath and smile! Smiling always helps.\nThe third question is about vocabulary. Oliver, from Anhui wrote, \"I want to remember all the new words. I write them down, but I forget them quickly. What should I do?\"\nTry to remember eight or ten words a day. Write them on pieces of paper and place them in your bedroom. Say the words when you see them, and change them every day. And when you're  shopping, how about counting the English words, or saying the English names for everything you see?", "id": "middle181.txt"}
