I'm from New York but I'm living in a small town in England now. There is one wide road in this town and there is no train. You can see a shop, a restaurant and a pub along the road. There is a church near the shop. We usually go to the church on Sunday mornings. There is a lake to the east of the town. Many people like to have a picnic near the lake.\nMy house is not very big but it is very beautiful. I have a garden in front of my house and I often grow some flowers in it. There is a table and some chairs in the garden, too. I often read books and drink tea there. Sometimes my friends come to visit me and we like to talk in my garden. My life here is comfortable so I am very happy.\n,.", "id": "middle4008.txt"}
