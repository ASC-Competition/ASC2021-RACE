At that time my little brother was about four years old and he missed mum all the time.\nOne day, after I had given him his dinner, he started crying for mum. He was so young and really needed mum. So I dressed him, put on his shoes, carried him on my back and walked out. Soon he fell asleep. About half an hour late, I found that he had lost a shoe while sleeping. I took him off my back and put him down. I knew we needed to find that shoe, for our mother couldn`t afford new shoes. We had to go back to find it, so I told my brother to Wait right here.  A man heard it and stopped me just before I walked off. He asked me, \"You are leaving your brother here to find the shoe? What would you do if he is not here when you return?\" I did not know how to answer that question. He continued,: It is OK if you can`t find the shoe, but it is not OK to lose your brother.\" Then he sent us to mum`s workplace by taxi.\nI have depended on the kindness of many strangers in my whole life. I feel regretful that I cannot find them and say thank you. I don't even remember what the man`s face looked like, but he taught me a lesson--people are more important than things.\n,,.", "id": "middle5489.txt"}
