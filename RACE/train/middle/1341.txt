Three years ago he began to go to school. He studied hard and does well in his lessons. His parents like him very much.\nHenry's grandpa is a single man. But once he lost a leg in a traffic accident. And now he can't work. He often tells the boy all kinds of interesting stories. Sometimes he makes a kite or a cage. And he teaches the boy how to catch the singing birds and how to give them food. The boy admires him very much and always stays with him when he's free. But Henry's mother didn't like the old man. She always thought him useless and dirty, and didn't let her son play with him but the boy didn't listen to her. When they sat at table, she put some food on another table and filled a broken bowl with rice and porridge. The old man was very sad but he dared not say anything. Henry was angry with his mother about it. One day he saw a broken bowl on his way home. He picked it up and put it into his bag. His mother found it and asked, \" Why have you brought a broken bowl home, dear?\" \" I keep it for you.\" said Henry, \"When you're old like my grandpa, I'll fill it with rice for you !\" Having heard this, the woman began to cry. Since then she's been good to the old man.", "id": "middle1341.txt"}
