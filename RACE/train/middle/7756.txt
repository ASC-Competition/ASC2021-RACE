His workmates asked him how he could find the seats by accident. \"The method is very simple,just your patience.\"smiled the man. His workmates were puzzled.\nOne day, one of his workmates was on business with him.The train car was so crowed that they couldn't even find a place to stand on. \"Let's find seats to sit on,\" said the man. \"Find seats? Just a joke?\" said his workmate.\"Just follow me,\" said the man.\nThey pushed their way through the crowds.The workmate wanted to give up , but the man insisted  . At last,in the 7thcar they found two empty seats .They sat there happily at once. The workmate asked,\"How do you know there are seats here?\"The man answered ,\"I didn't know it at all.But I know most of the passengers are easily cheated by one or two cars of crowed phenomena . Even though they know there are seats, they don't want to crowd among the groups.They think it's not worth doing that.\"\nThe method seemed not to be clever enough,but it works. For us, patience will let us have a \"seat ticket\"life forever.\n,.", "id": "middle7756.txt"}
