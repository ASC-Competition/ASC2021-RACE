My name is Peter. I think a good friend is like a mirror. I'm tall and have short hair. My best friend Jack looks similar to me. I'm quiet and like reading books. He likes reading, too. So we often spend time together reading and studying. I like sports. I play basketball very well and he is good at playing basketball too. I don't think it's easy for me to make friends because I'm quieter than most of the other boys. But I think friends are like books--you don't need a lot of them as, long as they're good.\nRead and answer the questions(, )", "id": "middle6555.txt"}
