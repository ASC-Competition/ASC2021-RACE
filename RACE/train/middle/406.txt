Many people said yes to it. The officer said that these days, the food safety accident about children milk of Sanlu made the government decide to give it up. In order to keep the food safe and people healthy, Chinese government said that all the food must be checked. The rule of food with no checking made in 1999 was given up from that day.\n\"I think if the companies get the food with no checking, they will never check their food. It gives them the chance of making the food of poor quality,\" an old man said in the shop. \" I hope our government not only gives it up, but also makes some strong rules to manage the companies,\" a young woman told us. \" The important point is our government should send officers to the companies and check their food every time,\" a shop owner said. A young expert of food safety said, \" The department of government should take the food from the shop or supermarket and check, not ask them to send. In that way, we can get the real checking.\"\nBut in order to keep people's health, the government asks the officers to check all the food before they are sent to the shop or supermarket. That means all the food must be checked before they are sold.", "id": "middle406.txt"}
