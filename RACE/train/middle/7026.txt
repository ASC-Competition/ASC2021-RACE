He was excited and yelled   after the MP3. When he walked out of his room the next morning, he could hear nothing about his mother's words. His mother sent him to the doctor at once. It was moderate   hearing loss  .\nDo you have an MP3 player? Do you use it to listen to your favorite music? A survey   shows that lots of young people enjoy listening to their MP3 players. And they always listen to them at high volumes  . There are about 100 million people listening to MP3 players in Europe every day. Most of them are young people. Scientists have found that if people listen to MP3 players at a very high volume for more than five hours a week, they could lose their hearing in five years.\nHigh-volume music can keep people excited, so young people would like to keep their players high. It's too bad for the ears. So the MP3 listeners should keep the player within safe volume levels, no higher than 60~70 of full capacity  . If people near you can hear your MP3, that means you are keeping your MP3 at a very high volume, turn it down, please!", "id": "middle7026.txt"}
