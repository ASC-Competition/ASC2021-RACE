But there are still some people who don't believe family life can be an enjoyable experience.\nSome people already accepted the idea of the \"me generation\" so they fail to understand that there is a time in life when they have to give up their time to something more valuable.\nAt a time when adults need to think about the needs of their family, they will be doing other important things. Some people will spend too much time working for a more powerful car or a bigger house so that they can proudly say that they have them. Some will be doing dangerous things so that they may tell their stories to their friends, and others will recite things like \" I must become the best I can be.\"  or \"I don't want to be at the bottom.\" The needs of their family will be forgotten and they never seem to have time for the family.\nMany people have not experienced a strong helpful perfect family life, so they have never discovered its worth. Many people have always experienced family life as a flight, so they can't find time and energy for work.\nBut it is really very important that we all expect good family relations. We need to realize and value the importance of what can be achieved by loving each other in the family. It is also important for our society to encourage family members to create happiness.", "id": "middle7987.txt"}
