One net held a very strange fish, five feet long and bright blue. Strangest of all, it had fins     that looked like legs!\nIn the nets, only this fish stayed alive for several hours. Before the fish began to rot ( ), a young woman made a drawing of it. She sent her drawing to a scientist on sea life, Professor J. B. Smith.\nUpon seeing her drawing of the fish, Smith couldn't believe his eyes. Could it be true? It just didn't seem possible, but there it was. It could be only one thing, a coelacanth, a fish people believe having died out fifty million years ago. How could the fish be swimming about only a few days before?\nIf we found one, there must be others. The professor put up posters offering a reward for catching such a fish. Other scientists laughed at Smith. They thought the search was a waste of time. Years passed. It seemed the other scientists were right. But Smith never gave up hope. One day, fourteen years later, the professor received a telegram. Afish had been caught that looked like the one in the poster. Would the scientist fly to the region and check the fish? Smith did.\nWith shaking fingers the professor raised the cloth around the fish. It was exactly like the one in the young woman's drawing. It was a coelacanth,a missing link with the past!\nAfter the discovery of the coelacanth, scientists began to wonder. Is it possible that an even stranger creature will someday be discovered?", "id": "middle4634.txt"}
