It was so cold and snow was falling so heavily that the roads were covered with ice and a strong wind was blowing. Being outside in such weather was very unwise. However, Peter Lee had to walk home from work. Peter walked with difficulty along a country road, the cold wind beating against his chest. He thought, \"If I wear my coat backwards, maybe, it will be a little bit warmer for me.\" He stopped walking, took off his coat, and put it on backwards. \"That's much better,\" he said to himself happily. Walking on through the thickly falling snow, he was thinking about drinking a cup of warm coffee by the burning fireplace.\nA few minutes later, a car knocked down Peter. The driver hadn't seen him soon enough. When he tried his best to put on the brakes  , the car skidded   on the icy road. The frightened driver got out of the car and ran to see how the poor man was.\nAfter a while, a police car arrived. A policeman went up to see Mr Lee who was lying on the ground. He told the driver, \"I'm afraid he's dead.\"\nThe driver was so surprised. \"This can't be the case, because I hardly touched him. Check my car carefully. There's not a mark on it.\"\nThe policeman said, \"I'm sure he's dead.\"\n\"It's impossible,\" the driver said anxiously. \"As soon as I hit him, I ran to help him. He was lying on the road, but he was breathing and there was no blood.\"\n\"Did you touch him?\" the policeman asked.\n\"Yes, but only to turn his head around the right way,\" the driver answered.", "id": "middle5653.txt"}
