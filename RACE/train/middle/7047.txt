It is a poisonous   American snake. When it is angry or afraid, it makes a noise like a rattle with its tail. It's very scary. But Heather Ramirez and her husband, from California, in the United States, make a living in an unusual way. They are self-employed   snake catchers! They catch snakes, especially rattlesnakes which have gone indoors, and return them to the wild.\nHeather describes her work as \"protecting people from rattlesnakes -- and protecting rattlesnakes from people!\" In the area where they live, rattlesnakes often come face to face with people. They are found in stores, offices, houses and gardens. Heather explains that it's not the snakes that are moving into places where people live, but it's the other way round. The snakes lived in these places first and then the people built houses.\nMost people who see a rattlesnake are feared. If you keep your distance, however, the snake won't bite   you. In twelve years as a snake catcher, Heather has never touched a snake. She doesn't take the risk. She picks up the snakes with a special tool. This doesn't hurt _ , but it keeps them at a safe distance so that they can't bite her.\nHeather and her husband are very busy because they are never off duty. Catching snakes is a full-time job and they don't often have a day off. People can get to them at any time of the day or night. Not everyone can do this job, but Heather doesn't want to do anything else. \"I just love my job,\" she says.", "id": "middle7047.txt"}
