They often make me think of some special experiences and feelings. This summer I've reviewed this kind of tales, The Little Prince. It was published in 1940. It's the world-famous fairy tale by the French author Antoine.\n\"I\", the narrator  of the story, is a pilot. His plane has something wrong and lands in the Sahara. The little prince lives on a small planet, and he grows a flower called ROSE there. One day they have a quarrel , so the little prince runs away. On his all-alone journey, he meets different kinds of people. From these people he gets a conclusion  that grown-ups are strange. And with the help of the man he meets, he descends in the Sahara.\nThis book moved me a lot. It is not only a fairy tale for children and teenagers, but also for grown-ups.\n,.", "id": "middle958.txt"}
