Don't listen to people who say that young people today often think only of themselves. It's not true at all. More and more young people in the USA volunteer to spend their school holidays working for others. And they don't do it for money. Here are some of their stories.\nAlice Hamilton, 17   I'm going to help the Forest Center build new hiking paths in the mountains. It's going to be terrific - I'll spend the whole summer living in a tent and breathing the clean mountain air. I'm going to sleep under the stars. It will be a nice sport, and I'll be able to do something good at the same time!\nJason Moore, 18   This summer, I'm going to volunteer with Special House Program. They build good, low-cost houses and sell them to the families that are not very rich. They'll teach me what to do, so I'll help people and also have a chance to learn how to build houses.\nTrish Anderson, 16   I'm going to teach kids who have trouble reading. I'll work for a program called Reading For Life. Every day, I'm going to help kids choose and read books that they like. I want to be a teacher and I love children and reading, so this is going to be a great experience for me.\n.", "id": "middle4743.txt"}
