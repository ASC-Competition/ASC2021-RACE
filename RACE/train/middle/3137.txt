Are you in bed yet?\" called Mrs White. There was no answer. Mrs White put down her book and went to her 14-year-old son's room. Tom was sitting in front of a bright computer screen on which a colourful dragon jumped and shouted.\n\"Oh, Tom! You're still playing on that computer. You must stop now. It's half past eleven. If you don't go to bed soon, you'll be very tired tomorrow,\" said Mrs White.\n\"But I've nearly beaten the dragon,\" said Tom. Mrs White could see the excitement on her son's face. She sat down beside him.\n\"You are always playing on that computer. You spend more time with this machine than with your family,\" she said with a smile. \"What's special about it? Show me what it can do!\"\n\"I think this is a great computer, Mum!\" he said happily. \"The hardware   is good. There's so much memory and it has some wonderful software programs. This game, 'Dragon Player', is my favourite, but I sometimes borrow games from Daniel and other friends. I don't have to worry about any infected  disks because I have a virus  detector   which can go over any disk and check it for viruses. Let me show you!\" Tom began tapping. The screen changed in answer to his orders.\n\"Oh, Tom,\" laughed Mrs White. \"I'm sure it's a wonderful computer, but I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.\"", "id": "middle3137.txt"}
