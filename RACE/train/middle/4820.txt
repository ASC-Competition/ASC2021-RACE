But she is remembered as much for her help as for her acting.\nBorn in Belgium in 1929, Audrey's father was British and her mother was Dutch. Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies.\nBut it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \"Gigi\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24.\nAudrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \"Hoolly Golinghtly\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \"Eliza Doolittle\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice. In 1989, the UN Children's Fund named Audrey a goodwill ambassador. She travelled all over the world in support of UNICEF  projects. The UN agency said she was a tireless worker. She often gave 15 interviews a day to raise money and get support for UNICEF projects.\nAudrey Hepburn often said her love to UNICEF was the result of her experiences as a child during World War II. She said she knew what it was like to be hungry and to be saved by international help. She was a goodwill ambassador until her death in 1993 from cancer.", "id": "middle4820.txt"}
