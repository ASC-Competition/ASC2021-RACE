Last Friday he came back from school with a letter.  The letter was from his teacher. \"I got a red flower today. Could you please sign this note?\" he said to Mum. The note showed that he had been talking in class.\nTed hardly gets top scores in his school work. The best he gets is \"OK\", but often he gets \"You can do better than this.\" Mum knows what it means. She tells me \"You can do better than this\" means \"Extremely bad\" in China.\nIn the USA, teachers never say anything too bad about their students, even if the students are making trouble in class or not working hard enough. The worst they might say is \"Please be nicer tomorrow\". Many parents are satisfied with--- a B-grade for each subject.\nBut things in Chinese schools are quite different. Parents have _ for their children. I sometimes felt that my second-grade cousin spent more time on homework than I did when I was a 6thgrader in the USA! Yet his parents and teachers didn't think he worked hard enough.\nIs it too strict in China? Or is it not strict enough in the USA? Maybe both are true.", "id": "middle2846.txt"}
