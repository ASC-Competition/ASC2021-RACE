We met at the school fair  . Each year, all the fourth-grade classes hold a school fair. Everyone in the fourth grade works at the fair. Some sell ice cream, drinks and snacks, others take care of the little children who ride the horses. I got the second job and I've never forgotten it, because that's where I met Tiger.\nMy job was to help little children get on the back of a little horse. I kept telling the children to wait their turn and holding ice cream for them while they rode about. It's clear that I was growing older and should be more responsible.\nSuddenly, a boy came to the horse. He took the little horse's reins  ! The horse stopped, and the girl on its back started to fall. I was trying to reach the girl when I saw Tiger go by my legs. It held the horse's reins and pulled the horse away from my legs. I caught the girl just before we both hit the ground. The girl sat on top of me. She was laughing at the ice cream on my face. The horse's reins were in Tiger's mouth!\nThanks to Tiger's fast action, I saved the little girl. We were both heroes. And Tiger, the fastest dog I've ever known became my new best friend.", "id": "middle6583.txt"}
