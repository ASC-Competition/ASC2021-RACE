They became friends and he came to Lena's parents house twice. Last week Lena said to her father, \"I'm going to marry  Watts, Daddy. He was here yesterday.\"\n\"Oh, yes.\" her father answered. \"He's a nice boy, but has he got much money?\"\n\"Oh, no, both of you are the same,\" the daughter answered angrily.
