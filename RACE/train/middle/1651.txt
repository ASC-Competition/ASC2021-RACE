They never stop going on about how I should keep my room tidy, keep my hair tidy and wear smart clothes. They even make me do the washing-up after dinner every night! None of my friends have got such tenable parents.  What should I do?\nHelen, USA\nHi, Helen. I think you should do what your parents ask. They're much older than you and you should respect them. It's their house you live in and their money you spend.\nEmily, Australia\nHelen, why should your parents do all the housework? You should help around the house. -it's only fair. I don't think you should change your appearance though. Teenagers should look like teenagers.\nSimon, England", "id": "middle1651.txt"}
