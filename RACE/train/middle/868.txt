Other parts of the face change shapes as we get older, but ears do not change their shapes. They only change in size.\nReading people's character from their ears is a very old science. In the past people thought that a person's ears with color was dangerous. They also thought that the shape of the ears showed if a person was musical or not. Today,too many people believe that the size and shape of the ears help you know if a person is musical.\nEars are all different,and each different thing has a meaning. Next time you look at a person,see if his or her ears are large,medium-size,or small. Look at the lobes .Do they stick to the face? Ears that are always red mean that a person may get angry easily. Ears that are always cold and nearly white color mean that a person has a nervous character.", "id": "middle868.txt"}
