This is true, but it can also make us in trouble sometimes.\nThe thing about online communication is that you have no idea what the person who is reading your messages is feeling. For this reason, it is always a good idea to be polite and cautious when writing e-mails or messages to your friends.\nChinese can be a direct language, but in English, people often talk about a subject in another way. So instead of saying \"Please meet me here\" or \"Do this for me now\", English speakers usually go for indirect phrases like \"Would it be possible\", \"if you have time\" or \"It would mean a lot to me if...\"\nIf you have a close friend, you may still run into trouble because of your jokes. If you have asked someone to do something and they need a bit more time, you might joke with him: \"What? You still haven't done it yet? What's wrong with you?\" While this seems funny to you, your friend may feel unhappy.\nIf you have foreign friends in different countries, the time difference can also be a factor. While you are waking up for class on Friday morning, they may be having a party on Friday night. You will be serious and they will, probably, be excited. So don't be angry if they seem not to care about you. Just try to message them at the proper time.", "id": "middle3065.txt"}
