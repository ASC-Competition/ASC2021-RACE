For example, some high school and university students in the US often spend many hours as volunteers in hospital or old people's homes. They read books for the people or they just visit them and play games with them or listen to their problems.\nOther young volunteers go and work in the homes of the sick people. They clean up their houses or do the shopping. For boys who don't have fathers there is an organization called \"Big Brothers\". University students and other people take these boys to play baseball games and help them get to know things that boys usually learn from their fathers.\nEach city has a lot of clubs where boys and girls can go to play games or take part in other activities. Some of these clubs show movies or have short trips to the mountains, the beaches or the museums. Most of these clubs use a lot of high school and university students as volunteers because they can understand the problems of these boys and girls more easily.\nVolunteers believe that some of the happiest people in the world are those who help to bring happiness to others.", "id": "middle1392.txt"}
