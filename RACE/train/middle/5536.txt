They could do business online in that way.That was how Alibaba began.His company grew quickly.But that didn't mean everything went smoothly.In 2000, many Internet companies failed including Alibaba.But later, he was successful because he managed to attract  investment into his company.\"You should stick to your dream,\" he said.\"Everyone thought I was daydreaming when I started.But the most important thing is that we believe in our dream from past to today and tomorrow.Of course we made many mistakes, but we never give up.\"\nMa Yun is also smart.For him, success in business is like trying to catch a rabbit.If there are nine rabbits, focus on catching one - don't try to catch them all,\" he said.\"Change your ways if you need to, but don't change the rabbit.Get one first, put it in your pocket and then catch the others.\"", "id": "middle5536.txt"}
