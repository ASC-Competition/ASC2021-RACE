The boys' team often helped the girls with their training  . They had never lost to the girls before, but this time the girls beat them 4 -- 3.\nAfter the game, Wu Nai, head of the boys' team, was very unhappy. \"We all thought this would be an easy game,\" he said. \"We never thought a team of girls could beat us. This is the saddest day of my life. \"\nBut Mr Hu, the boys' PE teacher, said he thought the girls should win. \"The boys were too confident  ,\" he said. \"I told them before the match that they needed to play well. They all thought that girls' football was a joke. Now they know better. They didn't play carefully, and they lost.\"\nThe match had started well for the boys. After 30 minutes, they were winning 2 - 0. Their best player, Lu Ming, scored in the thirtieth minute. Earlier, the mid-field player, Ma Zhengquan, had scored the first goal in only the second minute of the match.\nAfter the first half hour, the boys seemed to become too confident. At first, the girls had felt a bit nervous  , but then they became more and more confident. Just before half time, Li Xiaolin made the score 2 - 1.\nIn the second half, the boys were the first to score. It was from Lu Ming. After that the boys became lazy, but the girls kept on working hard. Hao Meiling scored in the 68th minute, to make the score 3 -- 2. Then Li Xiaolin scored twice in the last six minutes to make the last score 4-3. It was a surprising finish.\nThe girls' PE teacher, Miss Wang, was very pleased with their work. \"They were great!\" She said. \"I told them they could win. I told them that the most important thing was teamwork. The boys' team had some good players, but my girls were a better team!\"", "id": "middle3260.txt"}
