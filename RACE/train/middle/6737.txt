I was so excited to see all the different runners who passed by and quickly took a cup of water. Some ran past, some walked past and a few wheeled past.[:ZXXK]\nI saw so many types of people doing it. I thought maybe I could do it too! The next year I decided to run for the race, but I had little running practice. I just wanted to finish. On the day of the race, it was terribly hot. After running for about 5 miles, I was thinking, \"I must be crazy. Why did I do this? What was I thinking?\" And at one moment, I said to myself, \"I am never doing this again!\"\nThat first 10 km race was quite an experience. I jogged, I walked, I jogged and walked. At times, I didn't know if I could finish.\nNear the end, a 70-year-old man ran past me, very fast, and I felt a little embarrassed   that I was more than 50 years younger than he and I couldn't even keep up with him. But then I realized something. He was running his race and I was running mine. How often in life do we compare  ourselves to others when we really shouldn't? I decided that I would not give up on running races,and that one day I would be one of those 70yearolds who were still running.\nAs I crossed the finishing line, I was proud of myself. I didn't regret   having such an experience.", "id": "middle6737.txt"}
