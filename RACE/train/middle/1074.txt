Some younger kids may have them because their parents see it as a matter of safety and convenience. For example, a kid can call mom and dad when sports practice is over. And a cell phone can give kids almost instant access  to their parents if something goes wrong or they need help. It can give parents quick access to their kids so they can check on them and make sure they're OK.\nIf you do get a cell phone, make some rules with your parents, such as how many minutes you're allowed to spend on the phone, when you can use your phone, when the phone must be turned off, and what you will do if someone calls you too often, and so on.\nYou'll also have to learn to take care of the phone in your life. Keep it charged  and store it in the safe place so it doesn't get lost. And whatever you do, don't use it in the bathroom. I know someone who dropped her phone in the toilet!", "id": "middle1074.txt"}
