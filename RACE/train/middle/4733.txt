When the bell rang, the teacher smiled at all the students. Then she said, \" Good morning! How nice it is to have all of you in my class this year! I want to know each of you very much. I am sure we will enjoy working together.\"\nThe teacher smiled, used a pleasant voice, and acted in a friendly way. She told the students her name and wrote it on the blackboard. Then she told them something she liked to do and hoped to do with them during the year. The students knew that she liked many of the same things they liked. _ Each of them wanted to know her better and be her friends. Then she let the students tell something about themselves. So they felt that the teacher knew them. Could you make friends as the teacher did?\nHow do you know and like your classmates? One way is to find out more about them. During the break you can talk to them. You may ask them their names and the names of the schools they went to last year. They want to know about you, too. You may tell them about your interests or your holiday experiences. It is often easy to be friends with people who have the same interests and play the same games. As you talk, the others may be thinking, \" I like to do the same things you do. It should be fun to be friends with you.\"\nRemember! Just talking together in a friendly way is one good way to make friends.", "id": "middle4733.txt"}
