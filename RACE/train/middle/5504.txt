They had been married for more than 60 years. They kept no secrets from each other except that the old woman had a shoe box under her bed. She told her husband never to open or ask about it.\nFor all these years, he had never thought about the box. But one day the old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would never get better.\nThe woman said it was time that he should know what was in the box. The old man took the shoe box to his wife's bedside.\nWhen he opened it, he found two beautiful doilies  and some money. The money was $25,000.\n\"When we got married, \"she said, \"my grandmother told me that the secret of a happy family was never to fight. She told me if every time I got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet  one doily.\"\nThe old man was so moved because only two doilies were in the box. He thought she had only been angry with him twice in all those years.\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"but what about all the money? Where did it all come from?\"\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"that's the money I made from selling the doilies. So far, I have sold 2,500 doilies.\"", "id": "middle5504.txt"}
