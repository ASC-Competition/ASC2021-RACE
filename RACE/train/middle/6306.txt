I like We chat. It is fast, convenient and fashionable. And you can use it for free. It can be used in my mobile phone. It has hold-to-talk voice messaging function. I am a fan of Leehom Wang. Through We chat, Leehom Wang often says something to me. It's amazing.\nI am David. I love Micro blog. I update my Micro blog when I am free. We can share instant  messages with each other. I often look through Yao Chen's Micro blog. She has many followers. I make many friends with them. I often write something on my Micro blog, for example, \"I'm in blue today. I didn't pass the exam.\" Then many friends comfort me. I share my birthday party, my new phone, my new coat, etc. with my friends. It is fun.\nI'm Lily. I don't like We chat or Micro blog. I don't believe them. There are so many crimes  on We chat. Many people are cheated because they believe in other people they meet on We chat easily. It is not a real world. As to Micro blog, I don't think it is a good way to make friends. And you should write something no more than 140 words. I like keeping diaries. I don't want my secrets known by others. I am a low-key  girl.", "id": "middle6306.txt"}
