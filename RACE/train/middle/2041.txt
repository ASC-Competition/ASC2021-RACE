And she goes to her teacher for help.\nMary: Mrs. Smith, there is a colour in each of these sentence. What do they mean?\nMrs. Smith: In everyday English, blue sometimes means sad. Yellow, afraid. A person with a green thumb grows plants well. And a white lie is not a bad one.\nMary: Would you please give me an example of a white lie?\nMrs. Smith: Certainly. Now I give you some cake. In fact, you don't like it. But you won't say it. Instead, you say, \" No, thanks. I'm not hungry.\" That's a white lie.\nMary: Oh, I see. Thank you very much.", "id": "middle2041.txt"}
