There are hundreds of skills to help you read more in less time. Here are two skills that I think are very good.\nPreview -- if it's long and hard. Previewing is very useful for getting a general idea of heavy reading like long magazine articles and science reports.\nHere is how to preview.\n*Read the first two paragraphs and the last two paragraphs carefully.\n*Then read only the first sentence of the other paragraphs.\nPreviewing doesn't give you all the details. It tells you not to spend time on things you don't really want or need to read.\nSkim -- if it's short and simple. Skimming is a good way to get a general idea of light reading, like popular magazines or the sports of your daily paper.\nHere's how to skim.\n*Get your eyes to move fast. Sweep them across each line.\n*Pick up only a few key words in each line.\nEverybody skims differently.
