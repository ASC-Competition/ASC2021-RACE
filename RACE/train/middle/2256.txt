I played football with some other boys in the backyard all the time. My mom was worried that I would get ill in the hot summer.\nOne day my brother gave me a new football. I came into the yard and played it excitedly. But suddenly, the ball flew through the window and nearly hit my dad. Dad said nothing. He took my football and cut it in half.\nI didn't cry because I knew how terrible my mistake was. I didn't expect   to get another football. But to my surprise, Dad bought me another one the next month and told me to be more careful. I was really thankful for my father's forgiveness  . He showed me that even when I made a mistake, he still loved me and gave me another chance.\nParents always give us their unconditional   love and forgiveness. We should always give our love and forgiveness to them, too.", "id": "middle2256.txt"}
