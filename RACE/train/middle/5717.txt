You may not think that having a good family is a problem. But for me , it was. I had to face the problem of being the youngest of the Smith girls.\nWe live in a small town in Pennsylvania, US. There are three girls in the Smith family, Amanda, Theresa and me . People often say things to me , like \" Oh, the three of you , you're such nice girls. Your sisters are so pretty and so thin! You're really nothing like them . \" That made me sad.\nAt school , all of my teachers had taught my sisters . On the first day of school , they said , \"Oh , the youngest of the three! I hope you're just like your sisters. They're such wonderful students.\"\nPeople always compared  me with my sisters . So I couldn't help comparing myself with them , too. Theresa was smarter , Amanda was prettier . I began to work hard to be more like them . What my sisters did , I did , too. At last , I became drum major of our school 's marching band . Both Amanda  and Theresa had been drum majors . I became editor of the school's newspaper . Theresa had been the editor two years before.\nBut last year, Amanda went to college  , and Theresa went to high school . Now I'm by myself at junior high . Everyone knows me , because I'm the drum major and the newspaper's editor .\nNow I don't feel like a Smith girl any more , I feel like myself . I'm proud of doing all of the same great things that my sisters did . But the best thing I did was to learn to stop comparing myself with them .", "id": "middle5717.txt"}
