The biggest of all is the Great Pyramid. It is about 137 meters high and made of 2,300,000 big stones. Each stone weighs about two and a half tons .The biggest ones even weigh fifteen tons. It took more than 100,000 men twenty years to build it. Nobody can tell just how the men cut, carried and lifted the huge stones without our modern machines .\nThe Egyptian kings told the people to build the pyramids for themselves. They thought they had tombs  strong enough to keep their bodies well until they came back to life. But they never thought that about 5,000 years later their bodies would be on show in museums.", "id": "middle2064.txt"}
