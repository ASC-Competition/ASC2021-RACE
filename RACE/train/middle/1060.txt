But it seems that the president was not without faults.\nA New York library recently found that Washington borrowed two books from the library in 1789. He didn't return them.\nIf he were still alive, he would have to pay the library $300,000 for being 220 years late.\nOn October 5, 1789, when the first president borrowed the books form the New York Society Library, he didn't sign his name in the borrower's book. He just wrote \"president\" to show who had taken them out.\nThe two books should have been brought back a month later but were never returned. Workers at the library realized the books were missing.\nThe New York Society Library doesn't expect anyone to pay the fine. But it hopes that someone will return the books.", "id": "middle1060.txt"}
