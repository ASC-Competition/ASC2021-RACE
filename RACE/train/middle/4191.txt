It was really an eye-opening experience. In China, I had English classes five times a week. However, I didn't know how different textbook English was from daily English until I went to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say \"I'm fine\" when people say \"How are you?\" But in America, I found that people said \"I'm good\" or \"I'm tired.\" One day, someone greeted me with \"What's up?\" It made me _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.\nTo my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun.
