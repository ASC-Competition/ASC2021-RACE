Moments later, he saw a dog, but not its lead. He tripped over the lead and fell down. He jumped up quickly, went on running and got on the bus. After a while an old coach broke down in the middle of the road, and the driver couldn't move it. It was eight o'clock, the middle of the rush hour, so it soon created a terrible traffic jam. The bus driver tried to go round the coach. Unfortunately a taxi was coming in the opposite direction. The driver tried to stop the taxi, but he couldn't prevent the accident-- the taxi crashed into the front of the bus! Luckily nobody was hurt.\nWhen Daniel finally got to school out of breath, the Science lesson had been on for five minutes. Daniel said sorry to the teacher and sat at his desk. He reached out for his school bag-- no, it was nowhere to be found.\n\"Where is my school bag?\" Daniel was puzzled. Suddenly he realized that he had left it on the bus.
