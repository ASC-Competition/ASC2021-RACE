For the first time, scientists have made a robot that can take a beating  and keep on going. Scientists from Cornell University made the robot, which looks like a spider with four legs.\nUntil now, even the most advanced  robot was almost certain to break down when it was damaged . That is because its computer inside simply doesn't know how to make the machine work after its shape has changed.\nTo deal with this problem, the scientists put eight motors  and two sensors  that read how the machine is working. They all give signals to the machine's software. Using this information, the computer can then figure out the machine's shape at any moment.\nThe new technology is a big advance in robot-making, scientists say, and it's far from scary. It may someday help scientists create better artificial  arms and legs and give new freedom to people who lose _ . It might also help scientists understand how people and animals figure out their own sense of place in space.\n\"It has been difficult to design robots that can work well when the environment changes or when it's damaged,\" says Olaf Sporns of Indiana University in US. \"With this work, we are nearer to solving this problem.\"", "id": "middle1655.txt"}
