In Asia, especially in China, Japan, and Korea, it is difficult to go to university. Students must first pass the strict national examination. However, in Canada and the United States, it is easy to go to university, and anyone who wants to go can go. As a result, Asian parents decide to leave their countries so that their children can go to university.\nThe problem is that when Asians arrive, they discover that finding a job and making money are more difficult in the West than in the East. Also, they find that they are very lonely, and that they miss their homes. Because of these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the West. Therefore, these two reasons, most Asian parents decide to go back to work while their children study in the west. Therefore, these children become satellite kids\", and most of their parents do not know how sad it is to be a \"satellite kid\".\nOnly until now are Canadians and Americans discovering the \"satellite kids\" problem. Because these children do mot speak English and because their parents are not there to take care of them, they are often absent from school. To be a \"satellite kid\" means growing up in a country where you know you are different and where you cannot make friends because you do not speak English well. Also, it means growing up lonely, because your parents are elsewhere. What these \"satellite kids \"will probably say to their parents is that it's better to have parents around than to have a university education.\n,.", "id": "middle3925.txt"}
