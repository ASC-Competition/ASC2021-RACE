He was 12 and had been at the Children's Home since he was only four.  I thought of him. He was honest . For example, the handle   of the ax  broke one day. Jerry said the Children's Home would mend it. I handed him some money to pay for it. He wouldn't take the money. \"I'll pay for it, mama. I broke it. I didn't hit the wood in the right place. \"\n _ And it was a weak handle. I'll speak to the seller. \" It was only then that he would take the money.\nAnother thing about Jerry was that he would do those little but helpful things. The things would not be badly needed but would make life so much easier. For example, he found a hole near the fireplace. \"I'll put some wood in the hole, mama. Then when a sudden storm comes up, you can stay warm. \"\nOne cold day, Jerry sat close by me near the fire. We watched the fire bum. He suddenly talked of something he had never talked of before. \"You look like my mother, especially  next to the fire\"\nBut you were four, Jerry, 'when you came to live at the Children's Home. Do you still remember your mother?\"", "id": "middle69.txt"}
