On the 14th of November, the two spacecrafts finished the second docking. ThenShenzhou VIIIparted fromTiangong Iagain and returned to the earth safely on the 17th.Tiangong Iis still traveling around the earth in the space, waiting for the arrival ofShenzhou IXandXand so on in the near future.\n _ marked another great leap for China's space program and made China the third country in the world, after the United States and Russia, to master the space docking technique  .\nThe world's first space docking was achieved in 1966, when the manned U.S, spacecraft Gemini 8 (8) docked with an unmanned Agena Target Vehicle  . Space docking is necessary to explore space beyond Earth's orbit. \"The capability increases China's ability to act independently in space, as well as its ability to work together with others,\" said Gregory Kulacki, a U.S. space scientist and senior analyst.\n\"With the success of its first space docking, China is now equipped with the basic technology and ability required for the construction of a space station,\" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space program.\" The country is on its way to building a permanent manned space station around 2020.\"", "id": "middle443.txt"}
