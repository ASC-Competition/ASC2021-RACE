Mary is asleep now.\" and \"It's too late to telephone. Mary will be asleep now.\"?\nYes. The difference is in the reason given for it being too late to telephone. In the first sentence \"Mary is asleep now\", the speaker is stating  a fact. In the second sentence \"Mary will be asleep now\", the speaker is saying what Mary usually does. In fact, it's possible that Mary isn't asleep, but she is usually asleep at this time.\nSo let's take two situations. In the first case, imagine Mary's mother answers the telephone.\nYou: \"May I speak to Mary, please?\"\nMother: \"No. It's too late. Mary is asleep now.\"\nYou: \"Are you sure? It's only 10 0'clock.\"\nMother: \"Yes. I went to her room and she was asleep.\"\nThe mother knows that Mary is asleep because she went into her room and saw her.\nHere is another case. Two friends decide to telephone Mary.\nJack: \"Let's telephone Mary. It's 10 0'clock.\"\nJill: \"No. It's too late. She will be asleep now.\"\nJill knows that Mary always goes to bed before 10 o'clock, so now she'll probably be asleep. But it is also possible that she is staying up late.", "id": "middle5058.txt"}
