It is easy to understand how this expression was born. When my face has a nice fresh, pink color, it is a sign my health is good.\nThe color green is natural for trees, it is an unnatural color for humans. When someone doesn't feel well, someone who is sick, for example, we say he 'looks green'. When someone is angry because he doesn't have what someone else has, we say he is 'green with envy'.\nSome people are 'green with envy' because someone else has more dollars, or 'green backs'. Dollars are called 'greenbacks' because that's the color of the backside of the money.\nBlue is a cool color. The traditional blue music of American blacks is the opposite of red hot music. It is slow, sad and soulful (  ). To be blue, of course, is to be sad.\nThe color black is often used in expressions. People describe a day in which everything grows wrong as a 'black day'. A 'black sheep' is the member of a family or group who always seems to be in trouble. If someone meets a 'black cat', something unlucky might happen to him. Not all the 'black' expressions have bad meaning. A company 'in the red' is losing money. If someone tells you to put someone 'in black and white', they want you to write it down.", "id": "middle3587.txt"}
