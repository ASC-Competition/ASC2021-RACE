But Rydal Elementary School, one of the oldest schools in Boston, doesn't accept family holidays as an excuse for their absence and give them a warming notice. So Mr. Rossi wrote a letter to the school, which has been shared by thousands of parents online.\nDear Mrs. Marbyry,\nWhile I am thankful for your concern for our children and the best education our kids receive from you, I can promise you they've learned as much in the three days we were in Boston as they would in a whole year in school.\nAlthough they missed an important test, they learned about something more important for them, especially for their future.\nThey experienced first -hand the love and support form thousands of other people with a common goal. At the marathon  , which is known as the most difficult one in the world, they watched runners with disabilities work together to collect money for children in poor areas.\nIn addition, our children walked the Freedom Trail, visited the site of the Boston Tea Party and the graves of several great pioneers of America. These are thing they WILL learn in school a year or more from now.\nWe truly love our school and teachers. But I wouldn't hesitate   to pull them out of school again for an experience like the one they had this time.\nThank you for your time.\nSincerely,\nMichael Rossi", "id": "middle5510.txt"}
