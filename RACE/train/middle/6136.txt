He said it was easy for people to see yellow buses and the black letters on them in early morning or late afternoon. That would make children safer.\nThere are not many school buses in Britain, and they are not yellow. They have trackers   on them, so children are being tracked while they travel to and from school by bus. The trackers let parents know where the school bus is and whether their kids are on the bus.\nKindergarten   is a difficult time for some kids.
