On the way, they saw a lake. They stopped and the teacher told the student, \"I'm thirsty. Get me some water from that lake.\"\nJust when the student reached the lake, a cow was walking in the lake. So the water became very dirty. He thought \"I can't give the dirty water to my teacher!\"\nHe came back and told the teacher, \"The water is very dirty. We can't drink it.\" After about half an hour, the teacher asked the student to get some water again. So he went back to the lake.\nBut the lake was still dirty. So he told the teacher the same thing. After some time, the teacher asked him to go back again. But this time, he found the water was clear. The mud in the water came to the bottom. So he got some water.\nThe teacher looked at the water and said to him, \"You did nothing to make the water clear. You just let it be. Your mind is also like that! When it is bothered , just let it be. Give it some time.\"", "id": "middle7659.txt"}
