Since they were going the same way, he offered to carry some things for the boy.\nAs they walked, Mark discovered the boy's name was Bill. He loved video games, baseball and history, but he was having trouble with some of his subjects.\nThey arrived at Bill's home first.  Mark was invited in for a Coke and to watch some television. The afternoon passed pleasantly with some laughs and talk. Then Mark went home.\nThey continued to see each other around school, had lunch together once or twice, then both graduated from junior school.\nThree days before graduation, Bill asked Mark if they could talk.\nBill reminded Mark of the day years ago when they had first met. \"Did you ever wonder why I was carrying so many things home that day?\" asked Bill.\n\"You see, I took away all my things from school. I had stored away some of my mother's sleeping pills . I was going home to kill myself. But after we spent some time talking and laughing, I realized that if I had died, I would have missed so many good time. So you see, Mark, when you picked up those books that day, you did a lot more. \"", "id": "middle2883.txt"}
