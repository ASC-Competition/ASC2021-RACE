Then the site decides whether Castle has eaten healthily and done enough exercise.\nAll the seventh graders in Castle's school have done the same thing since the year started. It's part of their health class.\nIf the site finds her habits are unhealthy, it will give her advice. If she does something good, the website will give her a star.\nHer health teacher set up a competition to see which student could get the most stars from the website. Castle has got 30 stars so far.\nCameron Bartlett said she liked tracking the food and activities. \"This is the first year we've done it,\" she said. \"It's really interesting to see all of the different choices that we have.\"\nThe seventh grade health class is coming to an end. They won't be in health class, but the students all said that they would go on to take part in the Fuel Up to Play 60.\n\"There's lots of bad food out there that we've all been eating,\" Bartlett said \"This really helps all of us eat healthier food.\"", "id": "middle1756.txt"}
