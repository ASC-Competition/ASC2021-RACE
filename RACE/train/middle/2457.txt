Life changes and so we do. We must change ourselves to face the changing environment, or we will fail.\nJust look at the cycle of the seasons. Trees bud in spring and in summer their leaves turn green. In autumn, their leaves start to fall onto the ground. When winter comes, there are no leaves on trees. Next spring the cycle begins again. Since we know there are cycles in nature, we can prepare for them. We know it is colder in winter and hotter in summer, so we can dress properly.\nSince we accept the cycles of nature, we should also accept the changes in our life.\nWe can prepare ourselves for changes by becoming more flexible . We can regard the changes in our life as chances. As we keep changing ourselves, we can keep up with the changes in our life.", "id": "middle2457.txt"}
