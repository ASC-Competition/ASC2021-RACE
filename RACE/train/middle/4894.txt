The information they provide will be important for you to know when you take tests. You must be able to take good written notes from what your teachers say.\nTaking good notes has three stages. There are certain things you should do before class, during class, and after class. Here are the three stages of note-taking and what you should do during each class.\n1. Get Ready to Take Notes\nReview your notes from the previous  class before you come to class. This will help you remember what was covered and get you ready to understand the new information your teacher will provide.\nComplete all assigned  readings before you come to class. Your teacher will expect that  you have done this and will use and build upon this information.\nBring all note-taking materials with you to class - several pens and pencils as well as your notebook.\n2. Take Notes\nKeep your attention on what your teacher is saying. Paying attention to \"signal statements\". Examples of signal statements are \"The most important point ...\" and \"Remember that ..,\" Be sure to include in your notes information that your teacher repeats or written on the blackboard.\nWrite quickly so that you can include all the important information in your notes. Do this by writing abbreviated   words such as med for medicine, using symbols such as % for percent, and writing short sentences. Place a \"?\" next to information about whose meaning you are not sure.", "id": "middle4894.txt"}
