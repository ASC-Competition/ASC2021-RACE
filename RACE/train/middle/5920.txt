Some children spend six hours a day in school and four to six hours a day in front of the television set. Some even watch television for eight hours or more on the weekend.\nTelevisions are like books or films. A child can learn both bad things and good things from them. Some programs help children to understand the news, and others show people and places from other countries or other time in history. With television, a child does not have to go to the zoo to see animals or to the ocean to see a ship. Boys and girls can see a play, a concert or a game at home.\nTelevision brings many places and events into our homes. Some programs show crime  and other things that are bad for children, so parents sometimes help them find other interesting things to do.", "id": "middle5920.txt"}
