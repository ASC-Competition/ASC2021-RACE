He wears glasses with heavy black frames . Here is a picture of him from 1968. What a surprise! In the picture, he's 15 years old. He's short and he is wearing glasses with small round frames. He has short blond hair and it's really straight. He is wearing blue jeans and a T-shirt with the word \"love\" on it. I'm 15 years old now. I'm of medium height and I have short hair. My hair isn't blond. It's blue. My father thinks it's strange  , but my friends think it's great. I wear glasses, but my glasses have bright red frames. They're so cool! I have an earring   in one ear, too. I never wear blue jeans. I' like big baggy pants   and long T-shirts. Most of my T-shirts have pictures of my favorite rock bands on them.", "id": "middle563.txt"}
