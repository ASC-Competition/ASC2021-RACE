Tonight, in the dark, I would finally take it away. If everything went OK, it would be done by morning. But I had to be sure no one, not even my wife, saw me.\nIt was more difficult to get away from the party than I expected. I said that the children were tired and needed to get to bed. It was partly true. But the main reason for leaving was that I wanted to complete my plan.\nFirst I had to get the kids to sleep. That was never easy at any time and tonight it was even more difficult. The eldest one wanted to know why we left the party early. I told him 10:30 pm was not early. As usual, I read them a bed time story, but I had to stop myself reading too quickly or _ would learn my secret.\nSilence finally came, and feeling like a thief in the night, I went out of the house and into the garage. Taking one end, I dragged  the bag out from its hiding place and took it into the garden. I was worried that my neighbours might see me and call the police.\nIt was already eleven o'clock. By the light of the moon I started working, trying to make as little noise as possible. And that was not easy with a saw   and a hammer.\nAfter much effort, my work was finally completed. I looked down at my watch. It was exactly 4:00 am. Then I went inside to have a shower and get a few hours of sleep. It wouldn't be long now before the kids would rush into my room and wake me up to tell me about the new tree-house Father Christmas had brought them this year.", "id": "middle3701.txt"}
