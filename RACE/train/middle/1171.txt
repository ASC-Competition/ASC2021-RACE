They think that dogs are much cleverer than cats, sheep, cows or other animals in their homes.\nOne of my best friends, Bob, has a dog named Jack. Every Sunday afternoon, Bob and Jack have a walk in the park nearby. Jack likes these walks very much. One Sunday afternoon, I stayed in Bob's home for a long time and we talked happily. Soon it was time for them to take a walk in the park. Jack was worried about it. He walked around the room several times and then sat down in front of me and looked at me. But I still paid no attention   to him. I went on talking with my friend. At last, Jack could not wait any longer. He went out of the room and came back a few minutes later. He sat down in front of me again. But this time, he held my hat in his mouth. Suddenly, I understood what Jack meant.", "id": "middle1171.txt"}
