The old man's hands trembled  , and he couldn't see clearly. The family ate together at the dinner table every night. But the grandfather's trembling hands and poor sight made eating rather difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he drank milk, he spilled it on the tablecloth. The son and daughter-in-law became angry with him. \"We must do something about Grandfather,\" said the son. So the husband and the wife set a small table in the corner. There, the grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner at the dinner table. Since the grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl. Sometimes he had tears in his eyes as he ate alone. The four-year-old grandson watched it all in silence.\nOne evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood on the floor. He asked the child sweetly, \"What are you making?\" Just as sweetly, the boy said, \"Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mum to eat your food from when I grow up.\" The four-year-old boy smiled and went back to work. The words struck the parents and they were speechless. Then tears started to run down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done. That evening the husband took the grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table.\nThe wise parents should realize that the children are their parents' mirror.", "id": "middle6285.txt"}
