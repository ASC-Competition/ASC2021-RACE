They mean that they want to write stories or books for people to read. That's good! It's good to write something for people to read! But they should know that they need to be good readers first before they really are good writers. They should read a lot of books, and read for hours and hours every day instead   of watching TV and spending a lot of time playing games when they are free.\nIf you are a good reader, it doesn't take you long to do the reading homework. Then you have time to read many other books for fun. Because you read so well, you have more fun in reading and you want to look for more books to read.\nBefore you decide to be a good writer, you'd better say to yourself, \"I must read and read and read more and more!\"", "id": "middle1759.txt"}
