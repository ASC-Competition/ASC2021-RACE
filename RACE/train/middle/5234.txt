In MIT the students have the same pressure which encourages them to have to study hard. But MIT usually gives one year for the new students to adjust   to the transition (;). In their first term all the new students are graded by a test. In this test if he or she receives a C or the level better than C, his or her result will be kept forever. If she or he receives a D or an F, no record will be kept.", "id": "middle5234.txt"}
