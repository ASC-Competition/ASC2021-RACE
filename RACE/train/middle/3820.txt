When he was there, he always asked his doctor when he could go home. He didn't like to spend Christmas in hospital. Though the doctor did his best, Mr Smith didn't get better. So on Christmas Day he was still in hospital. He spent a bad day in bed thinking that he missed a lot of fun on such a happy day.\nThe next day the doctor told him that he might be well enough to leave hospital in time for the New Year. Mr  Smith was very happy to think that he would spend New Year's Day outside hospital. Soon Mr Smith left hospital and on New Year's Eve he went to a party. He enjoyed himself there. But he drank too much. On his way home that night, he had a fall and broke his left leg. What a unlucky man he was!", "id": "middle3820.txt"}
