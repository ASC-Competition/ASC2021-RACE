Here in Rockland we have a Spring Cleanup Day every year in April. The Cleanup Day 2014 will be April 20th. It will start with a town cleanup at 8 o'clock in the morning, and a tree planting activity at the Rockland Park is to follow in the afternoon. One thousand young trees are sure to make the park greener and prettier.\nWe will divide the people coming to help into eight teams for eight different areas. As usual, we will provide gloves, rubbish bags and other cleaning tools. You will also get free lunches and Tshirts when the cleanup ends at noon. We are going to have a friendly competition to see which team can pick up the most rubbish.\nBring your kids with you. It is a great chance to teach them to care for the environment around us. We have free drinks and chocolate candies for the children at the park.\nMeeting: At the gate of Rockland Park, the town hall at 330 Jones Street, or the corner of Palace Street and North Street.\nSignup  : Call 5862397 on weekdays, or visit our website below any time you like.   www.springcleanup.com", "id": "middle5698.txt"}
