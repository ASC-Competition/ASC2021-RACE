He looked to be in his late 40s but was probably a lot younger. He had shoulder length straight black hair and a short beard.\nEvery day after work I would remember to gather any spare change, and put it aside to give to him if I saw him. A feeling of joy would come over me every time I saw him, while coming off the ramp  . So did he. Sometimes the red light would be on for a minute and we would ask each other about our day. His answer would always be the same, \"I'm blessed!\"\nThen one day I was called into my boss's office and was told that I was being laid off. For the rest of that day all I could think of was \"how am I going to provide for my kids as a mother, how am I going to pay rent?\"\nNeedless to say that on my way home that day I was very sad and upset. I didn't remember to look for my spare change and keep it ready like I usually did. Yet there he was as always, as I turned the ramp. He set his eyes on me, while still smiling and waving at others as usual.\nWhile I was waiting for the red light to turn, he strolled   over to my car. He had a big smile. He looked at me straight in the eyes and said, \"Today I will give you a dollar.\" He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a dollar bill.\nYou see that day he taught me a valuable lesson more than a dollar bill. No matter what material things are taken from you, no one can take away your choice to be joyful. Every time I'm faced with challenges, I think of the homeless man's valuable lesson and remember that I am blessed.", "id": "middle3193.txt"}
