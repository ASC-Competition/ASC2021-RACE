He wished to make it a forest.\nThe good doctor had some interesting ideas about planting trees.He never watered his new trees.Once I asked why,he said,\"If you water them,each baby tree will grow weaker and weaker. Otherwise,they will have to grow deep roots to look for water under the earth by themselves.\"\nHe planted some oaks, and instead of watering them every morning,he beat them with a rolled-up newspaper.I asked him why he did that,and he said it was to get the trees' attention.\nDr Gibbs died two years after I left home.I always walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant about twenty -five years ago.They're very big and strong now.\nI also planted two trees several years ago.I carried water to them for a whole summer.I sprayed them.However,after two years of caring too much,whenever a cold wind blows in, they shake a lot.\nLife is hard,whether we want it to be or not. What we need to do is try our best to make our roots reach deep into the brave heart,so when the rain falls and the wind blows,we could face them strongly and won't be beaten down.", "id": "middle7579.txt"}
