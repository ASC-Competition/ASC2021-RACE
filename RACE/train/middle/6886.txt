One day they were reading a story about their great grandfathers: Shiny's and Smily's great grandfathers decided to have a race. While Shiny's great grandfather went to sleep during the race, Smily's great grandfather won the race by slowly walking towards the finish line.\nSmily said, \"If your great grandfather didn't go to sleep, my great granddad might never win. So his win was not a real win.\"\nThe next day there was a notice in the jungle  newspaper. It said that there would be a race and the winner would win many prizes. The race started from the bear's house. From there, the runners had to cross the river. But most of the animals could not both run fast and swim fast. So they didn't know what to do. Shiny and Smily made a plan.\nShiny ran, while smily was sitting on his back. He and other animals, like the deer, reached the river side at the same time. But they saw the swift water and stood there because they were worried. None of them liked the idea of crossing the river. Smily quickly got into the water and Shiny sat on his back. Smily started swimming. Soon they reached the other side of the river. Shiny got down from Smily's back and Smily climbed on Shiny's back again. Shiny ran fast. They reached the finish line first.\n\"Both of them are the winners.\" The president of the jungle said, \"Shiny and Smily helped each other during the race and they won. So let's give them a big hand.\"", "id": "middle6886.txt"}
