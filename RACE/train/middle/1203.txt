He was very happy to be chosen and will accept the meaningful challenge  Another five volunteers are all space lovers., including three Russians, an Italy-Colombian and a Frenchman. They are about to feel what it's like to travel to Mars, only without leaving the earth. They are locked up together for a year and a half under a similar condition to the red planet during the whole process. So the experiment is called Mars-500.\nWhen reporters asked what they would miss most during the 520-day special life, French trainer Charles said:\"For me, it will be mainly my family, the sun and fresh air.\"\nThe Mars-500 test will be in a special building in Moscow, Russia. Although the people won't leave the building, they will fell as if they are on a real trip to the Mars. The most difficult thing will be to be separated  from the people that they used to live with. The trainer won't see sunsets, sunrises, won't feel rain for 18 months. That will be hard.\nThe main task is to study the \"Man and environment\". It'll care about the astronauts' getting experience and physical effects. The 520-day-test is divided into three parts,the first 250days to Mars, the middle 30days of landing on Mars, the last 240 days to return to the earth. Everyone will stay there alone for a long time and will work lonely. They will have to make decisions themselves and only then report to the earth, and the earth will tell them whether they do the right thing or not.\nEach astronaut is preparing for the great challenge. It is learned that they will be launched early in June. And the experiment will end in November 2011.", "id": "middle1203.txt"}
