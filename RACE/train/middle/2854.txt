{"answers": ["B"], "options": [["Mr. King.", "Bob Watson.", "Regent Brand.", "Mrs. Watson."]], "questions": ["According to the passage, who often buy things in the supermarket?"], "article": "Dear Mr. King,\nYour supermarket chain is excellent in many ways. I enjoy the things you sell, such as the selection of produce   and fresh bakery items. I have been a long time supermarket shopper and hope to continue for many years. I have found, however, that I must make a separate shopping trip to one of your competitors because there are many items your store does not carry. This becomes inconvenient for me, as my time is valuable, and I do not like to make two trips. Your low prices and excellent customer service keep me coming back to your supermarket, but I would be a more satisfied customer if I could find all the items I need in one place.\nTo tell the truth, I have never been able to purchase nacho   cheese soup at your store. I can find other flavors   of soup, but your store does not carry nacho cheese soup, a common ingredient   in many of my recipes. In addition, I can only find large wonton wrappers  , while many other stores carry both large and small and offer a more varied selection for their customers. Another example is Regent Brand Chili Seasoning. Though it is not a leading brand, it is still common on the shelves of other grocery stores in this area and is superior in flavor to its competitors.\nI sincerely hope to continue a relationship with your store, and I hope that you will consider the possibility of expanding your goods to be more competitive.\nYours truly,\nBob Watson", "id": "middle2854.txt"}
