I loved my small special class more than any group I had taught in the past. They were hungry for knowledge and I was enjoying teaching.\nOther teachers had told me that our children were from poor families and not to expect any child to bring a Christmas gift. In fact, I wasn't expecting any gifts.\nImagine my surprise when every child brought me a gift on the day before our holiday break. First, I got a much-loved toy monkey from a shy girl. I was told, \"He is my favorite, but I love you and I want him to be with you, Miss Taylor.\" How thrilled I was!\nNext came a new set of Christmas tree lights that was \"missing\" from a mother's cupboard .\nFinally, I came to one little boy's gift which I had never received. It was an old, dirty and broken Christmas storybook. Just when I wanted to show my happiness, I was interrupted  by the giver, \"And see, it is new! It still has the price tag .\"\nWhen other children laughed at him, I stopped them and said, \"Oh, books are good in that way. The story is always new if you have not read it before. Now, Let's read one together.\" Everyone listened quietly as I read the most wonderful Christmas story of my life.\nI still keep those Christmas gifts. They always remind me of my lovely kids.", "id": "middle2234.txt"}
