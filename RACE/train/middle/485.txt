While sweeping leaves on the ground, my five-year-old son Nick came over and asked me to write something on a piece of paper to make a sign for him.\n\"What for?\" I asked.\n\"I'm going to sell some of my stones, \" he answered.\nNick _ stones and had collected many stones from all over. \"I'm busy to\ndo that for you. Go and ask your mum for help.\" I said.\nA short time later, Nick returned with a sign, reading. \" Stones. One Dollar Each\". He took the sign, a small chair and 4 of his best stones and walked to the road in front of our garden. There he put the stones in a line and sat down on the chair.\nAfter half an hour, nobody passed by. I walked to him and asked him to go back, but he didn't.\nAnother half hour later, a small car came down the road. I watched as Nick stood up, holding his sign up. A woman rolled down a window and read the sign. I couldn't hear their talk, but I saw the woman turn to the driver and the man reach for his pocket.\nI sat in the yard, as Nick ran to me. Waving the dollar, he shouted. \"I told you I could sell one stone for a dollar -- if you believe in yourself, you can do anything.\"", "id": "middle485.txt"}
