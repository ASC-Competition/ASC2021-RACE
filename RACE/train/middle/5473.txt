He was hungry. Then he decided to ask for a meal at the next house. However, when a nice young woman opened the door, he changed to ask for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry and brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, \"How much do I pay?\" \"You needn't do that,\" she said. \"Mother has taught me to be kind.\"\nYears later, the young woman became seriously ill. She was sent to a big city. When Dr.Howard Kelly, a very famous doctor now, heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. At once, he got up and went down through the hospital hall into her room. He recognized her at once and decided to do his best to save her life. He did it and they won at last!\nBefore she left, the bill   was sent to her. She was quite afraid to open it. Finally, she looked, and to her surprise, she found these words on the bill: \"Paid with a glass of milk.Dr. Howard Kelly.\"\nTears of joy came down from her eyes as she said silently, \"Thank you, God. Your love has passed through hearts and hands.\"\n,,. (5,2,10)", "id": "middle5473.txt"}
