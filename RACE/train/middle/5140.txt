They stay in the same place in space.  We move about them. I can prove that time is the same. It does not pass. We move in time the same way that we move in breadth, length and thickness.\"\nNone of us believed the time traveler, and we argued with him for many hours.\n\"If we could travel back in time,\"  the scientist said, \"We could do things to change the future.\"\n\"If we could travel forward in time,\" the doctor  said, \"we could do things that change our present.\"\nThe time traveler smiled, \"It is clear,\" he said, \"that there is only one way I can show you that I am right. We must do an experiment. Please wait here.\"\nHe left the room and soon returned, carrying what looked like a clock.\n\"This is a model of a time machine. It took me two years to make it,\" the time traveler said. \"I want all of you to understand that when I start the machine, it will immediately travel in time and disappear from the present.\"\nHe turned to the youngest of all. \"Give me your hand,\" he said.\nThe young man put out his hand. The time traveler took it and placed it on the machine. Immediately, there was a sudden wind, and the little machine disappeared.\nI was certain this was not a trick, but the doctor was not so sure.\n\"Are you asking us to believe,\" he said, \"that the machine is now in a different time?\"\n\"Certainly! In my laboratory, a full-size machine is almost complete. As soon as it is complete, I shall send myself on a journey through time. Would you like to see my machine?\"\n\"Are you serious about this?\" the doctor asked.\n\"I have never been more serious about anything,\" the time traveler said, \"Come.\"\nWe followed him to his laboratory. There, we saw the actual machine, not quite complete, but large enough for a man to sit in.", "id": "middle5140.txt"}
