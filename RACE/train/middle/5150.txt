They prefer to teach themselves because they like to develop their own ways of thinking. They think standard ways of teaching might stop people from being creative and having new ideas.\nLesson 2: The answer might not be what you expect\nFind your answers from facts -- not start with an expectation of what you will find. Stephen Jacobsen from Northwestern University believed what he was taught: that water on Earth came from icy comets  or planets which hit into Earth.\nHowever, by studying a special rock, he discovered that it acts like a sponge . This suggests that Earth's water may have come from inside, driven to the surface to form the oceans, by geological activity.\n\"I had a pretty hard time making others believe it,\" he said. \"But thinking about the fact that you may the first person to see something for the first time doesn't happen very often. When it does, it's amazing.\"\n _ \nYears of planning went into a recent achievement in space travel. The European Space Agency's \"Philae\", a robot landing craft, met up with Comet 67P, which is 480 million kilometers away. The trip from Earth by \"Philae\" had taken ten years!\nThe scientists had no idea what the surface of the comet would be like. If the landing failed, it would be impossible to get information from the spacecraft. Twenty years of work would have been wasted.\nWhen \"Philae\" tried to land, it bounced  away from the comet's icy surface twice. Luckily, however, \"Philae\" landed successfully and began sending information back to Earth.", "id": "middle5150.txt"}
