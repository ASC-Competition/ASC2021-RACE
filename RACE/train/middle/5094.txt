The company has already found \"a close connection between color and satisfaction with a person's work area\". That's according to its spokeswoman named Meghan Casserly.\n\"Color is a silent salesperson,\" said Elyria Kemp. She is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of New Orleans.\nKemp is following color trends in business. She is studying the connection between feelings and color. According to Kemp, when people make an evaluation   of a product, usually they do this within 90 seconds or less.

She said the success of the company's jewelry   was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap   every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845.\nCoca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red.\nA spokesperson for Home Depot said research showed that the first thing people thought of was orange when they heard the name of the company.\nSmaller companies are also realizing the importance of color. But picking the right color is important.\n\"You know when something is right because you get a feeling of safety, and it's not something that you think about. It just will hit you,\" said Emil Hagopian, a distributor for Mar Plast Color Building Accessories in Ann Arbor, Mich. \"And sometimes, if it's done wrong, that also hits you.\"", "id": "middle5094.txt"}
