Her husband died of a heart attack. About a week after his death, she shared some of her insights with us.\nThe class was nearly over. She said, \"Before class is over, I would like to share with all of you an important thought.\"\n\"Each of us is put here on Earth to learn, share, love, enjoy and give all by ourselves. We must make the best of every single day.\"\nHer eyes were beginning to water and she went on, \"So I would like you all to make me a promise. From now on, on your way to school, or on your way home, find something beautiful to notice. It doesn't have to be something you see -- it could be a nice smell -- perhaps of freshly baked bread, or it could be the sound of the breeze slightly blowing the leaves in the trees.\"\n\"Please look for these things, and love them. For, although it may seem common, these things are the stuff of life. They are the little things we are put here on Earth to enjoy. They are the things we often take for granted. We must make it a point to notice them, for at any time it can all be taken away.\"\nThe class was completely quiet. We picked up our books and went out of the room silently. That afternoon, I noticed more things on my way home from school than I had that whole term.\nI usually think of that teacher and try to enjoy all of those things that we sometimes overlook  .\nTake notice of something special you see during your lunch hour today. Walk barefoot along the beach at sunset. For as we get older, it is not the things we did that we regret , but the things we didn't do.", "id": "middle1971.txt"}
