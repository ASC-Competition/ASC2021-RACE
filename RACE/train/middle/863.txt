But I don't know much Chinese. Now I'm learning it from my parents. They know much about China. They tell me many things about China.\nI'm happy to know you like your school and your family. You want to know my family and my school. I have a big family. My grandparents and my parents are all very fine. My father has a brother. He is my uncle, John. He and my aunt have their children. They're Bill, Linda, Mary and Lily. My brother Dick is a boy of eighteen. I like my family very much. I'll go to China next year with my mother. She is going to teach English in a middle school in Beijing.\nYours,\nAnnie", "id": "middle863.txt"}
