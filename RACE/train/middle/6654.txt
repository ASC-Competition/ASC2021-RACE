Then it reached a desert. \"I went through so many difficulties.I should have no problem crossing the desert,\" she thought. As she started, she found herself slowly disappearing into the sand. After many tries, she still failed. \"Maybe I can't reach the ocean,\" she said sadly to herself.\nAt this time, a deep voice said, \"If a breeze can cross the desert,so can a river.\" It was the voice of the desert. But the little stream answered, \"That's because a breeze can fly, but I cannot.\"\n\"That's because you _ what you are. Let yourself evaporate into the breeze, and it can take you across,\" said the desert. \"Give up what I am now? No!No!\" The little stream could not accept this idea. \"The breeze can carry the vapor across the desert and let it leave as rain. The rain will form a river again,\" said the desert. \"And whether you're a river or vapor, your nature never changes.\" Hearing this,the little stream went into the open arms of breeze. It carried her to the next stage of her life.\nThe course of our lives is like the experience of the little stream. If you want to go through difficulties in your life to head for success, you should also change the way you are sometimes.", "id": "middle6654.txt"}
