I wasn't very excited about it at the very beginning. But my uncle wanted me to visit Ireland and offered to pay for my trip. Then I did. All of the words \"magical, charming and memorable\" don't even describe what Ireland is. Our favourites were Kilkenny, Cobh and Killarney. We did a self-driver tour.\nWe stayed in a castle in Dublin for two days, where my ancestors  came from. The town we thought we might be bored in was Kilkenny, but we loved every minute we were there. There were so many places to explore and the pictures we took were beautiful.\nIt was so exciting to see the little village of Cobh and know it was the last stop for the Titanic(a famous ship) at that time. We loved the visitor centre there and the little shops. We never got any bad food there. It was so mouth-watering at every stop! And when we stayed in Westmeath, we saw the Trim Castle through the windows and found some scenes from Brave Heart which was filmed there. We were so excited. Again, more beautiful pictures were taken in that tiny town.\nWe love the country, the people, the food and the magic. We would go back very soon. I was so thankful for my uncle who had given me the chance to be there.\nI have no words to _ describe our trip. Go, explore the small villages, eat and enjoy! I still look at my pictures and can't believe I was actually there.", "id": "middle5219.txt"}
