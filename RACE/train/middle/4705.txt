I'm still thinking about taking walks in the park and meeting my friends at night. But I know that the school season is beginning. And homework, tests and routine   all come with it.\nWhen I stay in my room and write my homework, I often look out of the window and look back at this summer.\nIn the past two months of summer break, I spent many evenings in my backyard. I listened to my parents telling stories about their childhood. My brother caught fireflies  . Once in a while, we made a barbecue and ate chicken and corn.\nNow I'm back to school. It's difficult to find time to do everything that I want to do, like dancing, reading, and sleeping. How I hope to have another break in my studies! I could read a fun book instead of the boring ones that we have to read for English class.\nStill, I should not feel sad. Summer gave me time to relax, good memories, laughter, and the experience of new friendships. But without school, I would never appreciate the happy moments in summer and the responsibilities   that I have now. What's more, there are only 10 more months to go until summer comes again. And in the meantime, I can have lots of fun with my friends as we begin our high school experience together.", "id": "middle4705.txt"}
