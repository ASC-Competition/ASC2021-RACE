So mom's cooking and criticizing read our as \"I love you\".\"Then how do you say 'I love you to her?\" They agreed that getting good grades, followed by good jobs would be how they showed their love.\nI come from a culture where most people are expressive enough,so I repeated these queries in clauses over time.Gradually,I began to get different responses.Some of them had exchanged those sentiments with their moms.\nOne of my favorite stories of change came from a girl.When she came home from university,her mother met her at the door and hugged her.This had never happened before,but her mom said,\"Now that you have gone I have more time to myself.I noticed that in some places mothers and children hug each other and I decided it was a good idea and that I would begin hugging you.\"\nIn my family we all say \"I love you\" a lot.While it is true that we often say the words without having great depth of feelings at that moment,it is almost like a blessing we give each other. Those three little words carry a world of meaning,even when said as a greeting, but most especially if they are the lax words we say to or hear from those we love.", "id": "middle2057.txt"}
