I had to arrive in Vienna at 7:15 to catch it. He advised me to get off two stops before Vienna station and take a taxi. When the time came, the conductor even helped me with my bags. He wished me good luck as I jumped off. And a few minutes later, I was racing towards the centre of the city in a taxi. It was almost 7:25 when we stopped outside the station. I paid the driver quickly, took hold of my bags quickly and hurried inside. \"Pairs train\" was all I had time to say to the official I saw. You can guess how I feel when he pointed to a man that the train was just moving out of the station.", "id": "middle8274.txt"}
