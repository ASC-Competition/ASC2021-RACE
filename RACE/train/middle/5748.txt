I was born with a problem in my backbone and mobility  was a big challenge for me, but thanks to my teachers and friends, my school life was excellent.\nMy friends and I used to sit together and have lots of fun. Whenever we got a free period, we used to start shouting or play games. I took part in all competitions, such as poetry writing, story writing, painting and all activities on Teachers' Day or somebody's birthday and had much fun.\nMy English teacher was very tall. The moment she entered the class, we would all sit quietly and open the books. She would encourage me by giving me important assignments and also morning news to read during the assembly. She would come down and listen to my English debate , which made me take part in all debate competitions.\nThe same was true of my biology and science teacher. She was very nice and sweet. She would always give me extra information on the biology project. I could not go to the lab for experiments, so she would bring the lab down and help me with the biology and science experiments and would give me excellent marks.\nMy friends made me monitor and the naughty boys listened to me. My friends used to help me with my notes when I was absent . My teachers always gave me important project work and I felt proud when they _ after I finished it quickly and correctly. I was never shouted at or made fun of or scolded  by any of my friends and teachers.\nToday I often see the terrible punishments given to students on TVs. I feel very sad.\nI really want to express my love and thanks to all my wonderful teachers and friends, without them my school life would not have been so excellent and unforgettable.", "id": "middle5748.txt"}
