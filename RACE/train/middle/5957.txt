Whether you have one computer in the house or five, you should think the following things as you make a final decision.\nThere is a certain number of danger if you allow your children to have a computer with Internet in their rooms with no parental direction. They may share improper information and chat with strangers if they know that no one will be watching.\nThis does not mean that you cannot allow your children to have a computer in their rooms. Think allowing a computer without Internet. This is especially useful for teens who use the computer for creative projects, playing video games and listening to music. Keep in mind, however, that it is possible that your kids are more skilled at computers than you are and may remove any blocks you have in place.\nComputer Use\nThe way your family computers are used will play a role in deciding where they should be placed. A machine used only for homework will need to be in a quiet place where there is low traffic. One used for chatting online can be in the room where most of the family spend their time. If Mom and Dad use a computer for work, those needs will also have to be thought.\nSpace\nSpace must also be considered in computer placement. The computer will need electricity, plenty of desk space and a spot away from this bright light of windows. You will not want it placed in a room where your kids may be noisy.", "id": "middle5957.txt"}
