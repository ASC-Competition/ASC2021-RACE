She had to go to the party with her friends because her husband has been to another city to go on a business trip. Later that night, she was busy in dressing up herself as a ghost, including putting on masks and some special costumes.\nAfter finishing it, she went downstairs to look at herself in the mirror. Suddenly, there was a knock on the front door. She knew that it must be the baker  . She had told him to come straight in if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table. Not wanting to frighten   the poor man, Nancy quickly hid in the storeroom under the stairs.\nTo her surprise, it was her husband who changed his plan and came back home 2 days earlier. The husband called his wife's name happily and looked for her all around. Nancy was so excited that she ran to her husband without realizing she was a ghost at that moment. But it was too late. Her husband let out a cry and jumped back several steps. Then he lost his sense and lay on the ground.", "id": "middle5221.txt"}
