He wrote poems about people who worked hard through life but still found things to be happy about. He wrote plays and books about justice  for all people, and he wrote kids' books, too. The Sweet and Sour Animal Book is a book of his animal poems. Pictures and photos were used in the book. \"Hold fast to dreams\" is a line in a famous Hughes poem. That's exactly what he did throughout his life.\nWhen Steven Spielberg was in middle school, he wanted to make a film. He had an idea for a movie, but no money. He started a tree-planting business and made his film with the money he earned. Spielberg never stopped making films, even after many film schools refused him. Today he is one of the most popular and important filmmakers in the world. His movies are about people who are adventurous , brave, kind. His characters often fight for what is good.
