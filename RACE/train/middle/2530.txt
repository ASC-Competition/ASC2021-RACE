He was very happy when his father wanted him to buy something for him. One day at five o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Brown gave him two pounds and let him buy some stamps in the post office. Tom was very excited, because for a long time he did not have so much money. Mr. Brown told him clearly where the post office was. He expected(,) that he would come back in twenty minutes.
