I hope you don't think I've forgotten you. There have been so many places to see and so many things to do that I've not had much time for writing letters.\nI shall soon be starting my studies at King's College. So far I've been learning about England and British ways of living. I won't tell you about London. There are plenty of books you can read and plenty of pictures you can look at. I'm sure you'll be more interested to know what I think about the life here.\nI find some of the customs   new and interesting. People here do not shake hands as much as we do in Europe. During the first few weeks I was often surprised because people did not put out their hands when I met them. Men raise their hats to women but not to each other.\nYours\nAlice", "id": "middle182.txt"}
