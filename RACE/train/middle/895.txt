The robot will go after him all the time. It listens to everything he says. It sees everything he does. At night, it watches him sleep. It knows everything about Mr. Mott...\"\nIt sounds like a wonderful idea, doesn't it? But I'm afraid that Mr. Mott will not get on well with the robot, because everyone has something he doesn't want others know. It is privacy. Just imagine that there is a video camera around you all day. How do you feel? When you are taking an exam, a teacher sits in front of you and watches you all the time. How do you feel?\nMr. Mott doesn't lose all his memory. At least he remembers that he always forgets. So why can't he do something for this HIMSELF? He can keep a notebook with him, like most people do. In the notebook he can write down the things he should do, the persons he should meet and the places he should go. Isn't the notebook much cheaper and safer than the robot?", "id": "middle895.txt"}
