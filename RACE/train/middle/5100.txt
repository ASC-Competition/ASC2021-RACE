They are called Bill and Paul. They are good friends. One mouse lives in the country; the other mouse lives in the city. On a sunny day they meet in the street.\nPaul: Hi, Bill! Have a look at my house in the country. I'm sure you can enjoy yourself.\nBill: I'd love to. But I hear that the food is not delicious, and your house is not good. Is it so?\nPaul: No, that's not true. Go and see!\nThen Bill goes to the countryside with Paul.\nBill: Why do you live in a hole in the field? You should come and live in the city. You would live in a nice house made of stone. You would have better food to eat. You must come and see me at my house in the city.\nPaul: Thanks! Maybe you are right. I'll visit your house one day.\n _ days later Paul goes to Bill's house in the city. The house is big and beautiful. They are sitting in the sitting-room, having a big dinner comfortably. Suddenly, there a great noise.\nBill: Run! Run! The cat is coming!\nPaul: Oh, no! It's terrible! Both the house and the food are nice, but I do not like living in the city. I enjoy living in my hole in the field, for it is nice to be poor but happy than to be rich but afraid.", "id": "middle5100.txt"}
