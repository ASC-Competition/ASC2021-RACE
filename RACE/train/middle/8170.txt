Not knowing what else to do, they agreed to pray  to God on opposite sides of the island.\nOf course, the first thing they prayed for was food. The next morning, the first man saw a fruit tree on his side. But there was nothing on the other man's side.\nLater the first man prayed for a house, clothes and more food. The next day, all of these things were given to him. However, the second man still had nothing.\nFinally, the first man prayed for a ship so that he could leave the island, and the next morning he found a ship.\nThe first man decided to leave alone. As the ship was about to leave, the first man heard a voice, \"Why are you leaving your friend on island?\"\n\"My\ngs are mine alone, since I was the one that prayed for them,\" the first man answered. \"His prayers were all unanswered.\"\n\"You are wrong!\" the voice said. \"He had only one prayer, which I answered. If not for that, you would not have received any of our blessings.\"\n\"Tell me\", the first man asked, \"what he prayed for?\"\n\"He prayed that all your prayers would be answered.\"\nFor all we know, our blessings are not the fruits of our prayers alone, but those of others' prayers for us", "id": "middle8170.txt"}
