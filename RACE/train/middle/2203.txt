He ate a few, and then put the rest under his bed. The next day, after lunch, he went to his tent to get a cookie. The box was gone.\nThat afternoon a camp leader saw another boy sitting behind a tree. He was eating the stolen cookies! \"That young man,\" he said to himself, \"must be taught not to steal.\"\nHe returned to the group and found the boy whose cookies had been stolen. \"Billy,\" he said, \"I know who stole your cookies. Will you help me teach him a lesson?\"\n\"Well, yes. But aren't you going to punish him?\" asked the puzzled boy.\n\"No, that would only make him hate you.\" the leader explained. \"I want you to call your mother. Ask her to send you another box of cookies.\"\nThe boy did so and soon received another box of cookies. \"Now,\" said the leader, \"the boy who stole your cookies is down by the lake. Go and share your cookies with him.\"\n\"But he's the thief!\"\n\"I know, but try it--see what will happen.\"\nHalf an hour later, the camp leader saw the two come up the hill, hand in hand. The boy who had stolen the cookies was trying to get the other to accept his toy knife. The other boy was just refusing the gift from his new friend. He said that a few cookies weren't that important anyway.", "id": "middle2203.txt"}
