They saw an apple tree on the other side of the river. There were many big and red apples on it. But there was no bridge over the river. The monkey thought hard and had an idea. They pulled down a tree and put it over the river as a bridge.\nThe monkey said, \"My old friend, you go there first.\" But after the fox went to the other side, he kicked   the tree into the river and ran to the apple tree. \"How can I get 'there without the tree?\" cried the monkey. The fox laughed and said, \"You just stand there and watch me eating the apples.\" The monkey was very angry.\nSuddenly it began to rain. The water level   in the river rose and the tree flew away with the water.\n\"You can eat all the apples. But you can't come back,\" shouted the monkey.\nThe fox stopped eating and looked at the monkey sadly.\n,.", "id": "middle7802.txt"}
