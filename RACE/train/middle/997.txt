How do so many people move about the city on their way to work and school? So, we should know something about its transportation.\nIn New York you can travel about the city by subway, bus, taxi and car. The subway runs on the railroad lines under the city. It crosses the city at different points and goes all parts of the city. Traveling by subway is the fastest way to get around the city.\nThe second way to travel around the city is by public bus. It's a slower way to travel. This is because the bus moves in road traffic which is often heavy.\nYou can also travel around the city by taxi. This is the most expensive way, but the taxi will take you to the very place you wish to go to. If traffic is heavy, the taxi will be slow. During the mornings and afternoons, this is the \"rush hour\". This is the time when the traffic is very heavy with people going to and from work.\nThe last way to get around   New York is using your own car. However , it's not easy for you to drive, especially when you are driving in the \"rush hour\". If there is an accident on the road, you will have to wait for a long time.\nThe best time to travel around the city is from 9am to 4 pm. This is the time after the morning \"rush hour\" and before the evening \"rush hour\". Traffic will be less crowded because most people are already at school or at work.", "id": "middle997.txt"}
