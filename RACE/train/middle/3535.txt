We've got robots to build cars, carry heavy things, work in dangerous places and explore planets. But things haven't stopped there.\nIn 1986, Honda made a robot called ASIMO. And now, it has been developed greatly. Standing at 130cm and weighing 54kg. ASIMO is very much like a small astronaut wearing a bag on the back. And he can walk, flight, climb and run fast. Isn't it wonderful?\nThe world's first robot teacher is Saya. With her human-like face, she can show expressions like happiness, surprise, sadness, dislike, fear and she can even smile or show anger at students, which look much like a real teacher's. To do this, her rubber skin is pulled from the back with motors inside. And her eyes and mouth have wires  too. She can also say some simple words like \"hello\" or \"thank you\".\nIn the UK, the development of robots is exciting. The mini-robots will send food, clean floors, collect and throw away waste. These robots can open doors by themselves and stop if anything or anyone is in the way.\nThese mini-robots are very useful for controlling infection . Usually clean and dirty work is done by the same person, but here, you'll have robots that do\"dirty work\", like collecting dirty sheets, or taking away hospital waste; and you'll have robots that do\"clean work\", like bringing meals or clean sheets to patients. The robots have separate work so there's no way for infection, which is great. But of course, robots would not take the piece of humans, but would free up more time for nurses to be with patients.\nBut if this is what it's like in 2011, what's it going to be like to 2021?", "id": "middle3535.txt"}
