Last year, the watch was firstly introduced by Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. The price of the watch is from $349 to $1,099, depending on its size and whether it is a sports or regular one.\nApple engineers and designers have put in a lot of thought and hard work into creating this \"small screen\" on your wrist .  The \"sensor \" on the screen not only finds your finger, but also knows the difference between when you are tapping , and when you are pressing hard er.\nThe watch also has \"haptic feedback \". You can s end personal messages to your friend --such as drawing a star or a special sign with your fingers, or tapping the watch, say 3 times, and your friend will receive those taps on their wrist.\nBesides telling the time, the watch will use 'Bluetooth' to connect with your iPhone and show calls or text messages that come in.\nAccording to Tim Cook, the watch may open up a whole new area of applications  that we had never thought of. Some car f actories like BMW have developed an app that allows its car owners to open their cars with the watch. A 'Hotels' app may allow you to open the door to your hotel room without worrying about losing the smart-card. And finally, even at the airport--passengers may be able to simply wave their wrist to check into their flight.\nThe biggest use of the watch, however, is as your personal fitness coach. The watch can show your pulse (heartbeat) using a sensor at the bottom of the watch. It also has the same sensor as your iPhone, so it knows when you are moving, and also how much you are walking or running. It will remind you if you have been sitting for too long without taking exercise.", "id": "middle5746.txt"}
