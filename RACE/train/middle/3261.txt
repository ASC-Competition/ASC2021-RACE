There's no exchange of presents among business people, and if one American tries to give another a present, it may look like that he wants to bribe   him. Americans have learned that in some other countries people like to give presents to others, but among ourselves we don't see the need for presents.\nEven friends may never exchange presents. When I go to foreign countries, I try to bring back little things for _ but nobody would feel unhappy if I didn't. I don't often remember a friend's birthday, and few people outside of my family remember mine. If someone gave me presents too often, I'd get unpleasant.

You should only say, \"It's so nice. Thanks...\" when you get Christmas or birthday presents.\nYou may want to bring a bottle of wine   or flowers to a dinner party, but you're\nnever asked to.  Nobody will mind if you bring wine, but your friend may not use it that evening.\nAt Christmas we often give presents to our family and sometimes our friends.
