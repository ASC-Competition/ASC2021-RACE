They were very good to each other. They were half brothers because the elder brother's mother was dead, and then his father married again. The stepmother  was not kind to the elder brother, but the younger brother loved him and often helped him.\nOne day, the mother gave each of the brothers a box of seeds  and enough food for a few days. She said to them, \"Take them. Go and plant them. One of you must plant them on the east hill, and the other on the west hill. Don't come back if the seeds don't come out. \" The mother gave very bad seeds to the elder brother, but the two brothers didn't know this, and set out the next morning.\nWhen they came to a bridge, they sat down to rest. After that, they got up to say good-bye to each other, but they took the wrong boxes of seeds!\nTen days later, the elder brother's seeds began to grow and he came back. But the younger brother did not return home because his seeds didn't grow. At last, he died on the hill.\n,. (10)", "id": "middle2680.txt"}
