If someone says or does something that we don't like, we should just be quiet and try to stay away from that person in the future.\nWhy is Assertiveness important?\nIf you don't know how to be assertive, you might experience:\n*Depression - Anger, a sense of being helpless, hopeless, or of having no control over your life.\n*Resentment - Anger at others for taking advantage of you.\n*Frustration - Why did I allow that to happen?\nMost people find it easier to be assertive in some situations than in others. This makes perfect sense. It's a lot easier to hold your ground with a stranger than with someone you love. But the more important the relationship is to you, the more important it is to be assertive. Assertive behavior leads to increased respect from others!\nBut before you decide to act assertively, you have to decide if you can live\nwith the results. Although assertive behavior usually will result in a positive\nresponse   ,some people  might react differently.\nHow to be effectively  assertive:\n*Use \"I\" statements. Keep the focus on the problem you're having. \"I'd like to be able to tell my stories without interruption.\" instead of \"You're always interrupting my stories ! \"\n*Use facts, not opinions. \"Did you know that shirt has a hole?\" instead of \"You're not going out looking like THAT, are you?\"\n*Express ownership of your thoughts, feelings, and opinions. \"I get angry when he breaks his promises. \" instead of \"He makes me angry. \"\n* Make clear and direct requirements. Don't invite the person to say no. \"Will  you please?\" instead of 'Would you mind...?\" or \"Why don't you...?\"\n*Keep repeating your point. Use a low level and pleasant voice. Don't try to explain yourself.", "id": "middle1766.txt"}
