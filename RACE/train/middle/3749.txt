The 29-year-old American was not sure if he had the skills or a strong feeling for it.\nHowever, he went to work at an orphanage  in Nepal. His first thought was to make people impressed.\n\"I thought that if I volunteered just once. I could retell the story over and over,\" Grennan said in a Huffington Post article.\nHowever, his three-month stay it the orphanage turned into in unusual experience. It was 2004 and Grennan had given up his job to begin a year-long around-the-world trip, His first three months were spent in Nepal.\nWhen he arrived in the village, he knew nothing about the children or the local culture. When he opened the gate of the Little Princes Children's Home, he was faced by the excited children.\nThe young American ended up caring for 18 children. He later discovered that they were trafficked children. So he walked through the mountains with great difficulty to find the kids' families, \"I started walking with photos of the kids.\" he told the Reuters reporter. \"I would show up in villages and show photographs around. I went with 24 photos, and I found 24 families.\"\nAt the same time, he put his heart into Nepalese culture.\nGrennan said, \"Volunteering is the single best way to see how the rest of the world lives.\"\nHe also encouraged others to do what he had done. He believes that volunteering needs only making decisions to show up.\nGrennan's fight against child-trafficking has changed him. His book, Little Prince, came out last week.", "id": "middle3749.txt"}
