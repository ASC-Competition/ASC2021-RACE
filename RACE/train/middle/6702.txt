For example, some high school and college students in the United States often spend many hours as volunteers in hospitals, orphanages   or homes for the old. They read books to the people in these places, or they just visit them and play games with them or listen to their problems.\nOther volunteers go and work in the homes of people who are sick or old. They paint, clean up, or repair their houses, do their shopping or mow  their lawns . For boys who no longer have fathers there is an organization called Big Brothers. College students and other men take these boys to baseball games or on fishing trips and help them to get to know things that boys usually learn from their fathers.\nEach city has a number of clubs where boys and girls can go to play games or learn crafts . Some of these clubs show movies or organize short trips to the mountains, beaches, museums or other places of interest. Most of these clubs use a lot of high school and college students as volunteers because they are young enough to remember the problems of younger boys and girls.\nVolunteers believe that some of the happiest people in the world are those who help to bring happiness to others.\n,", "id": "middle6702.txt"}
