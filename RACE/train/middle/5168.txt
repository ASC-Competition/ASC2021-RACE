It is a very serious problem. So she starts a health program to deal with it. The health program is to reduce the amount of fat students today and in the future.\nThe program will get families, schools, newspapers, magazines and TVs to join together and deal with the students' obesity  so that students will be at a healthier weight. The program includes: Food stores should sell healthier foods. Schools should serve healthier meals with less fat and should also offer gym classes.\nThe lady is trying to fight the students' obesity all over the country because it can cause illnesses and higher health cost. She wants the students to eat right, exercise more and control their weight. She also wants the students to understand it is important to have less sweet food, and drink water, milk and fresh juices, but not to choose cokes. At the same time she has also set a good example by planting a vegetable garden. She hopes that the garden will encourage more people to plant one, too.\nThe health program is really helpful to the students today and in the future. As she says, we cannot always build the future for youth, but we can build our youth for the future.", "id": "middle5168.txt"}
