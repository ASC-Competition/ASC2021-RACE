But it is also true that many children today are using computers at schools before they can write. What does this mean for the future? Are these children lucky or not?\nMany people do not know about computers and they think of them as machines that children play with. They worry that children do not learn from experience but just from pressing* a button* and that this is not good for them. They think that children are growing not knowing about the real world. And they are very worried about that their children will lose themselves in the computer games.\nBut many people understand more about computers, they say that computers can be very good for children.

People who use e-mail have an e-mail address. This address must have letters and dots* and the symbol \"@\"meaning \"at\". This is what an address looks like. People can send the messages across the Internet. It is quick, easy and fun.", "id": "middle5045.txt"}
