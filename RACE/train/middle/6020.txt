My parents used to live in South America and I used to fly there from Europe during holidays. An airhostess would look after me and I never had an unpleasant experience. I like traveling by air and only once I have ever felt frightened. After taking off , we were flying low over the city and slowly gaining height when the plane suddenly turned round and flew back to the airport. While we were waiting to land, the airhostess told us to keep calm and to get off the plane quickly as soon as it had touched down. Everybody on board was worried and we wanted to find out what had happened. Later we learned that there was a very important person on board, and the police were told that a bomb was on the plane. After we had landed,the plane was searched thoroughly . Fortunately, nothing was found and five hours later we were able to take off again.", "id": "middle6020.txt"}
