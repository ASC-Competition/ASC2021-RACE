We may be really angry but we tried to bear things like those. According to ancient Chinese wisdom, we should shout in a loud voice instead of keeping silent. In fact, it's good for our health.\n\"Chinese people have passed on the practice from ancient times to now as a part of traditional medicine,\" said Mrs. Li, a 60-year-old woman from Hangzhou. \"My parents taught me to do this. It's a part of our folk culture. \"\nMrs. Li is a member of a group of people who love shouting. Each morning, she and some of her friends climb to the top of a hill and let out loud shouts before starting their daily exercise. They believe that shouting is good exercise for their lungs and it brings them a lot of fun.\n\"Sometimes I shout out and other shout back,\" said Mrs. Gu, another shouting lover. \"It makes you happy. You laugh and then you feel very comfortable. \"\nDr. Peter Calafiura, an American doctor, agrees that shouting can have a positive influence on people's health.\nSo, next time you start your morning run, why not try to shout out first? It will make you healthier.", "id": "middle2784.txt"}
