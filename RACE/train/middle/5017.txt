Liangliang called the police to take his mother away--such a \"good reason\" to call the police.\nMost people would just laugh it off. However, it shows that something is wrong with our education. It rings alarm to our Chinese parents to think about it.\nParents should ask themselves why they're so angry when their kids want to watch cartoons instead of doing homework. Kids are supposed to be simple and naughty . They can just ask their kids to do things they expect them to do. Schoolwork is important but a healthy childhood is much more important. If they push their kids too hard, the kids will not listen to them. Instead, parents should spend some time talking to their kids and help them grow in a good way. It's also a good way to help parents themselves to grow, too.\nIn China, lots of parents care more about scores  than any other things. They hope their kids can be top students and go to the top colleges. Curriculum Reformation  is coming though, and it would bring some changes to our schools. It's also time for parents to change their minds to reduce pressure  on their kids and help them to grow happily and naturally.", "id": "middle5017.txt"}
