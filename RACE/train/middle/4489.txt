Luckily for them, it didn't destroy   anything and no one was hurt. But a large stone fell from a nearby mountain and stopped in the middle of the road. When the earthquake stopped, many people came to the road and saw the stone. Some of the strongest men wanted to move it away, they tried again and again but at last they failed. \"Well,\" they said sadly ,\"there's nothing we can do about it, we'll have to change the way.\" At this time a boy of 12 years old said , \" I think I can move the stone away.\" \"You?\" all the strong men laughed at the boy, \"What are you talking about ?\"\nThe next morning people were all surprised to see that the stone was gone. It wasn't on the road any longer and it wasn't even near the road. The boy smiled and said \"I _ it.\"\nThe people looked rather surprised. \"You see,\" he said , \"I dug   a deep hole next to the stone and I dug a small incline   up to the stone and the stone rolled down into the hole itself. Then I covered it with earth. \"The villagers shouted \"Clever boy! Clever boy!\" and some of them said, \" Why didn't we think out this good idea ?\"", "id": "middle4489.txt"}
