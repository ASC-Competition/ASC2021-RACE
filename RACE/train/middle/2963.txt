Every day he went out and painted from morning to evening. When it got dark, he came back to the farm and had a good dinner before he went to bed.\nAt the end of his holiday he wanted to pay the farmer, but the farmer said, \"No, I don't want money but give me one of your pictures. What is money? In a week it will all be finished, but your painting will be here.\"\nThe artist was very pleased and thanked the farmer for saying such kind words. The farmer smiled and said, \"I have a son in London. He wants to become an artist. When he comes here next month, I will show him your picture, and then he will not want to be an artist any more, I believe.\"", "id": "middle2963.txt"}
