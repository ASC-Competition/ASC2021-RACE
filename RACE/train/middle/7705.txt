Thousands of people from other towns came to sell and buy things. It was the busiest time of the year.\nWhen \"Fairtime\" came, my grandma became the most \"useful\" and busiest person of the family. Grandma was a kind, well-educated old lady. She was good at cooking. All her relatives liked the food she cooked. During \"Fairtime\", they would come to live in her house and have meals there. Grandma was always happy to look after them.\nYear after year, many people moved to big cities. There was no longer \"Fairtime\". Grandma became very old and was gradually  going blind. My parents and I moved to live with Grandma in her house. We did our best to make her day-to-day life as comfortable as possible. I was at high school then.\nWhat I often did at home was to help Grandma with the daily newspaper's crossword puzzle.  However, she didn't look happy. She often sat in her room for hours, without saying a word.\nTo attract people to move back, the Town Hall decided to reopen the fair. One day, when I came back from school, I saw Grandma wearing her glasses, washing the dishes in the kitchen. With a big smile on her face, she looked a lot much younger. She told me that her two nieces would come. \"They said the food I cooked was very delicious and they want to stay in my house again,\" Grandma said happily. \"They will stay here for one week and we can have a big party. That must be the busiest week I've had in years!\"\nI suddenly realized that Grandma didn't want to be looked after. She wanted to be \"useful\", _ and helpful.", "id": "middle7705.txt"}
