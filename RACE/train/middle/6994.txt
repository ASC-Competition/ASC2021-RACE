I hated her, as she was such an embarrassment  for me. She ran a small shop at a market, selling anything for the money we needed.\nOne day, my mom came to my school. I threw her a hateful look and ran out. The next day, my classmates shouted, \"Your mom only has one eye! '' and they _ me. My face turned red.\nI wished that my mom would just disappear from this world, so I said to her, \"Mom, why don't you have the other eye? You make me a laughingstock.\" She didn't say anything. Maybe it was because my mom hadn' t punished me, so I didn' t think that I had hurt her feelings very badly. I decided to study hard so that I could leave her for the rest of my life. I made it at last. Now I'm living happily as a successful man in another country.\nMany years later, I received a letter, which said, \"I think my life has been long enough now, but would it be too much to ask if I wanted you to visit me once in a while? I' m sorry that I am an embarrassment for you. You see, when you were very young, you got into an accident, and lost your eye. As a mother, I couldn't stand watching you having to grow up with only one eye, so I gave you mine. I was so proud of my son that was seeing a whole new world for me, in my place, with that eye. I was never angry with you for anything you did. I miss the time when you were still young around me. You mean the world to me. I love you.\" I can't help crying with the letter in my hand.", "id": "middle6994.txt"}
