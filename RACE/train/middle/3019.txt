According to a new Australian study, a bad mood can actually be good for you. The study showed that being sad could help people to judge others more correctly and was also good for the memory.\nThe study was carried out by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales.\"People in a bad mood paid more attention to the people and things around them than happy people .Happy people were more likely to believe anything they were told,\"said Forgas\nFor the study, Forgas and his team did a lot of experiments. During the experiments, they made the participants  feel happy or sad by watching films and thinking about good or bad things of the past.\nIn one of the experiments, happy and sad participants were asked to judge whether some wrong things were true or not. The results showed that people in a bad mood were less likely to believe that these things were true.\nPeople in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw.\nThe study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style. In fact, the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful.", "id": "middle3019.txt"}
