Should it really be called \"optional\" if you have to do it? Unfortunately, I waited until the last minute to sign up.

So I don't think my question about whether vegetarians  can eat chocolate mousse was really that silly.\nMonday, April 13\nOne of my bright ideas worked out for a change! Everyone laughed when I handed out the chocolate \"moose\" cookie that I made yesterday, but this time I was laughing, too. The peanut butter antlers  were a _ . We're even planning to bake more cookies for the school food festival next week.", "id": "middle7655.txt"}
