I've designed about 20 websites for my friends.I've been doing most of the work on the weekends after I do my homework! I've bought a new computer with the money I earned. A little restaurants in my neighborhood has asked me to design a website for them, so my business is growing. I'm not sure what I want to do in the future, but I really like art and design. Maybe I should go into advertising.\nKwan,14,from Seattle\nI've been volunteering at a senior citizen center on Saturday mornings. Some of my friends think I'm crazy, doing a job for no money, but I really like it. I think that in a few months, I'll try to get a paid part-time job in a law office because I want to study law in the future. There's a lot of competition for part-time jobs, but I think my volunteering will look good on my resume.\nTamanna,16,from Dallas", "id": "middle5455.txt"}
