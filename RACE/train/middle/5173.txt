Then it reached a desert,\"I went through so many difficulties. I should have no problem crossing the desert,\"she thought. As she started, she found herself slowly disappearing into the sand. After many tries, she still failed.\nAt this time, a deep voice said,\"if a breeze   can cross the desert, so can a river.\"It was the voice of the desert. But the little stream answered,\"that's because a breeze can fly, but I can't.\"\n\"That's because you can't give up what you are. Let yourself evaporate   into the breeze, and _ can take you across,\"said the desert.\n\"Give up what I am now? No! No!\"The little stream could not accept this idea.\n\"The breeze can carry the vapor   across the desert and let it leave as rain. The rain will form a river again,\"said the desert.\"And whether you're a river or vapor, your nature   never changes.\"\nHearing this, the little stream went into the open arms of the breeze. It carried her to the next stage   of her life.", "id": "middle5173.txt"}
