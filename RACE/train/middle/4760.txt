How do so many people move on their way to work or school? In New York you can travel by subway, bus, taxi and private car.\nThe subway runs on the railroad lines under the city. Travelling by subway is the fastest way to get around the city. The second way to travel around the city is by public bus. It is a slower way to travel. This is because the traffic is very heavy.\nYou can also travel around the city by taxi. This is very expensive, but the taxi will take you to the very place you want to. If traffic is heavy, the taxi will be slow, too.\nDuring the mornings and afternoons, there is the \"rush hour\".This is the time when the traffic is very heavy with people going to and from work. The last way to get around New York is using your own private car. It is inconvenient   because you will perhaps be driving during the \"rush hour\".The best time to travel around the city is from 9 am to 4 pm, because it isn't the \"rush hour\".", "id": "middle4760.txt"}
