Both of them had long black hair and blue eyes. One day while they were playing in the back yard  , Emily heard a tinkling   sound. She jumped up. \"Listen,\" she told her twin. They listened. The noise came again.\nThis time Tina heard it. She sat up. \"It came from over there,\" She whispered, looking at the zinnias   far away. They came near to find it out. Then something flew out, making the same tinkling sound they had heard before. The children looked at one another. \"Was it a bee?\" asked Tina. \"I don't think so,\" replied Emily. \"Do bees make a sound like bells?\" \"Let's call it the Tinkle Bee anyway,\" said Tina. Emily nodded, listening with a little difficulty. What had made that noise?\nThe next day, Emily and Tina brought their cookies outside. Tina took her plate by the zinnias. Suddenly she caught something. \"Emily!\" she called. \"I've got the Tinkle Bee!\" Emily rushed over. They sat down on the grass. Tina opened her hand very carefully. There was that sound! Something was shining in Tina's hand. They smiled. Then Emily cried, \"It's a fairy  !\" Tina looked down at it in her hand. It looked like a girl. A _ girl with wings! Tina dropped it before she noticed that a wing was torn  . The little fairy could not fly away so she took a piece of grass out of the ground and sat on it.\nEmily and Tina were surprised at what they saw. The fairy turned to Emily and said, \"Hello, I am Marabella.\" Then she said again, \"Marabella the Fairy.\" Emily smiled. \"I'm Emily,\" she said. Tina said, \"I'm Tina. Are you really a fairy?\" \"Oh, yes!\" replied Marabella. \"I've always been a fairy.\"", "id": "middle2171.txt"}
