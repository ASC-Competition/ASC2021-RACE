These monkeys are always ready to serve you. Hungry, you just need to point to your own stomach and they'll lead you to the nearest restaurant. Thirsty, the monkeys will lead you to a bar. Tired, you put both of your hands behind your head and the monkeys will take you to the nearest hotel. Don't feel surprised when they put out their hairy hands to you after the service is done. They are just asking for a little money as a tip. After that, they will wave their hands as if they are saying goodbye to you.\nBelieve it or not, these monkeys are from the school for monkeys in India, where they were trained for one year. They are not the only monkey students in the world. Some are being trained as nurses in an American medical college. These monkeys are about to look after patients and help-them with their housework.\nA three-year-old monkey named Helen has learned to turn on TV, turn off lights, and open doors and windows when she is told to.
