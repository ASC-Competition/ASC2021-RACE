He lived in a dirty, wet room and was often worried about food. All his friends were very poor and they could not help him.\nOne night it was very cold. The wind blew and it was snowing heavily. Balzac went to bed early but couldn't fall asleep. He didn't get any food before he went to bed. He thought and thought, but he couldn't have a good idea.
