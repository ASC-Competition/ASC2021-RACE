It was very late, and he was alone on the dark road. Suddenly he heard someone behind him. He began to walk faster. The man behind him walked faster, too. He walked more slowly, and the man moved more slowly, too. He began to run, and the man was following him and he was really scared.\nThere was a wall on one side of the road, and he quickly climbed up on it and jumped down on the other side. \"If he passes and doesn't stop,\" Mr. Brown thought, \"everything will be all right.\" But the man didn't pass. He climbed up on the wall and jumped down, too. Mr. Brown's only thought was, \"I'm in great danger!\" He stood up and shouted, \"What do you want? Why are you following me?\"\nThe man was so tired that at first it was difficult for him to speak. \"I didn't know that you were a very good runner,\" he said at last, \"I have to go to Mr. White's house, but I don't know the way. A man at the station told me that you lived next to Mr. White's and he told me to follow you. I'm too tired to go any farther.\"", "id": "middle2655.txt"}
