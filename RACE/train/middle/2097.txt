One year, however, Mr.  Harris made a lot of money in his factory, so they decided to go to a foreign country and stay at a really good hotel.\nThey flew to Paris, and arrived at a 5-star hotel late in the evening. They thought they would have to go to bed hungry, because in that small hotel where they used to stay in the past, no meals were served after seven in the evening. They were surprised to be told that the hotel served dinner until ten.\n\"Then what are the times of meals?\" asked Mrs. Harris.\n\"Well, Madam, we serve breakfast from seven to eleven, lunch from twelve to three, tea from four to five, and dinner from six to ten.\"\n\"But that hardly leaves any time for us to see the city!\" said Mrs. Harris.", "id": "middle2097.txt"}
