He was very rich but also very mean. The most important thing in his life was money!\nAt six o'clock Bob Cratchit, Scrooge's clerk, went to Mr. Scrooge. \"Excuse me. sir. Tomorrow is Christmas Day, can l stay at home?\"\n\"Stay at home,\" shouted Scrooge. \"I don't pay you to stay at home!\" \"But it is Christmas,\" said Cratchit. \"Very well,\" said Scrooge. \"but you must work double hours on Boxing Day!\" \"Yes sir, certainly sir, Merry Christmas, sir.\" \"Get out,\" shouted Scrooge. \"Christmas! Everybody talks about Christmas!\" said Scrooge. \"It's just an excuse not to work. People want money too. Always money! For doing nothing!\" Scrooge put on his hat and coat and left the office.\nIt was Christmas Eve and everyone was shopping. It was dark and Scrooge was alone. He saw a person dressed in black.\n\"Are you the Spirit  of Christmas to come?\" asked Scrooge. The Spirit didn't speak. It pointed to a group of people. The people were talking. \"Is he dead?\" asked one man. \"Yes. No-one will cry for him,\" said another. \"He was a horrible, unkind man. He never gave money to us poor people. He wasn't a happy man.\" \"Who's dead?\" asked Scrooge. The Spirit pointed down. It was a grave . There were no flowers and no people there. \"Who is it?\" asked Scrooge nervously. The Spirit pointed again. \"No, I don't want to look, I want to go home.\" But the Spirit didn't move. Very slowly Scrooge rubbed the snow away. On the grave were the words EBENEZER SCROOGE.\nIt was morning. Christmas morning. Scrooge was in bed! \"I'm alive, I'm alive, how wonderful!\" He jumped out of bed, singing and dancing as he went around the room. \"What a beautiful day it is. I love Christmas. I love everybody.\"\nHe went to the butcher's and said, \"Take the biggest turkey you have to Bob Cratchit's house.\" Scrooge met the two men collecting money for the poor. \"Please take this,\" said Scrooge to the men and gave them a big sum of money for the poor. From that Christmas Scrooge was a new man. He helped the poor and was kind to everyone. He became a happy man and everybody loved him.", "id": "middle3280.txt"}
