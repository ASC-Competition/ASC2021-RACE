Ann is shopping with her mother. She wants her mother to buy a new sweater for her. In a clothing shop, she finds an orange one. She tries it on. It's too small. She wants a bigger one, but the bigger ones are not orange. Ann doesn't like other colours. Her mother asks, \"Shall we go to another shop to have a look?\" So they go out of the shop and go into another one.\nThe second shop is bigger than the first, and in it there are many kinds of sweaters of different sizes and colours. Ann tries on an orange one. It's too big. She tries a smaller one. It's OK.\n\"How much is it?\" Ann's mother asks the woman who sells clothes. Then they find it too dear, and they don't have so much money with them. \"Would you like a cheaper one?\" the woman asks.\n\"No, we shall take this one. My daughter likes it. We shall come back to buy it tomorrow,\" Ann's mother answers.", "id": "middle6819.txt"}
