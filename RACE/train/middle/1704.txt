Once he was making a television advertisement, all he needed to do was to miss a shot.\nFor Michael, this was difficult. He had conditioned  himself to succeed whenever he was throwing the ball. Every time he threw a basketball, it went in. Every time he tried to miss a shot, he couldn't. In total, it took him over 20 attempts   before he missed a shot.\nFor Michael, success is a strong habit. It took him a lot of time to break it. Just like drinking, smoking and collecting things, success is also a habit. Once it is formed, it is difficult to break. Many people think that success is difficult to keep. They feel that it will be hard work and will need too much action and focus. The truth is that it is simply a habit, and as easy to keep as any other habit.\nSpend some time making success a habit in your life. Once you have developed it, it is not something you want to change again.", "id": "middle1704.txt"}
