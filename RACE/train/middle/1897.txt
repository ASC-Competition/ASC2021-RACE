He drew cartoons, wrote stories, and played with plastic toy bricks  . His grandparents bought his first set of toy bricks when he was five years old and he's been building with toy bricks ever since. He even took his building bricks to college with him! Instead of books and a computer, he had a model of Greenwich Village made of bricks on his desk.\nNathan started as a lawyer but gave up His highly-paid   job to become an artist that uses toys in his art. He uses toy bricks to build everything from the Statue of Liberty  to Superman! He has more than 1.5 million colored bricks in his working room in New York which he uses to make pieces of art. He started by building small models but then decided to do something big and created a self-portrait  . It took him two days just to build the eyes.\nNathan's work has appeared in museums around the world. Children love his art because it is made out of the same toys that they play with at home and adults love his work because it is fascinating. Since it began in2007, Nathan's exhibition \"The Art of the Brick\" has been very popular with museum visitors everywhere.\n\"I'm proud that I took a dream I had as a child, to become an artist, and I have actually made a job out of it,\" says Nathan. \"To do what you love in life is the most important thing.\"", "id": "middle1897.txt"}
