But what about a father's role? I believe that fathers play just as important a role as mothers.\nFathers give us support. They are the shore we swim to when our arms and legs feel increasingly tired. They are the strength we rely on  as we take our first steps into the world. Fathers can be gentle and powerful, but they probably have the simplest love we ever know.\n _ , the father is their first hero and possibly the only man they will ever feel comfortable loving.\nFor daughters, the father is the first man they admire and the first man whose eyes shine with happiness when they look at them. He is the first man to fall in love with them.\nFor mothers, the father of our children is the person we can believe in to watch over the babies as closely as we would. We are protectedin the knowledge of their love. A father is the person on the planet with whom we can do whatever we want ... one who will be just as interested and never feel bored in the face of our devotion.\nWithout fathers, we wouldn't be mums. I would like to thank them from all our hearts for this honor and for being our partners in the business of raising children.", "id": "middle1703.txt"}
