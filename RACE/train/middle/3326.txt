I got all the hand-me-downs  . I never got to do anything first and my teachers always said, \"Oh, you're Jenny's little sister.\" \"No, I am Lauren!\" I never liked being the younger. Jenny and I got along with a few fights here and there.\nThen a few years ago, Jenny and I were in a car accident. She was okay, but I had a large scar   on my face. I was very sad. Jenny told me I shouldn't worry about the scar.\nOne day we were riding home from school on the bus. A boy named Jordan made fun of me about my scar. This went on for about a month. Finally I broke down and told Jenny about him. She was angry.\nWhen Jordan made fun of me the next time, Jenny stood up, walked to where he was sitting and said something into his ear. I didn't know exactly what she said, but Jordan never said a single word to me again.\nSo, even though getting all of the hand-me-downs might not be the best, I was very happy to have a big sister like Jenny.\nWhen anyone asks now, I will tell them, \"Yes, I'm Jenny's little sister.\"\n,.", "id": "middle3326.txt"}
