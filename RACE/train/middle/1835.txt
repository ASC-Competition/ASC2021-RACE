You may fail in an exam if you are lazy for most of the year and then work hard only a few days before the exam.\nDo not remember only grammar when you are learning English. Try to read stories in English and speak in English as often as you can. A few days before the exam you should go to bed early. Do not study late at night. Before you start the exam, read carefully over the exam paper. Try to understand the exact meaning of each question before you pick up your pen to write. When you have finished your exam, read your answers again. Correct  the mistakes if there are any and make sure you have not missed anything out.", "id": "middle1835.txt"}
