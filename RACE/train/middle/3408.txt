You' ve just arrived in Washington D. C. after a long journey and all you really want to do is lie down and relax in your hotel room. But first you have to make a few quick notes for tomorrow's meeting, check your e-mails, and perhaps print out a few- things. And you need to make a few local telephone calls, and one call to your family.\nAnd what do you usually get? Your desk is just about big enough for a cup of coffee, and there's no desk lamp~ the stationary  is only several pieces of paper and the only pen there doesn't work at all. If you want to print something, you have to go to the Reception ,and when you try to use your cell phone, you find that it won't work in the U. S. A.\nWell, Harmony Hotel is different. Just tell us ahead of time what you're going to need, and we'll make sure that it's waiting for you when you arrive. There will be a printer in your room if you want one, and a cell phone that really works. All you have to pay for is the calls you make.\nWe can also provide a room for business meetings, even a secretary to take notes. All we ask is a few days' notice.\nAll of our rooms are of the same high standard and we promise not to increase prices in the next twelve months. But book now, because many people are already calling to book rooms, and we'd hate to disappoint you.\nHarmony--the hotel you've always wanted, but never been able to find before.", "id": "middle3408.txt"}
