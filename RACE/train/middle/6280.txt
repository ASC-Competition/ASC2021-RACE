They can have a lot of fun, but the _ is almost the same. You start camp in the morning and go home in the afternoon. Sometimes, a bus takes you there or you might get a ride there. It might take you some time to like the place, the camp teacher, and the kids.

It's a kind of holiday, but without your parents. You'll sleep in adormitory  with other kids of the camp. You'll eat together in a large dining hall and you'll share the bathroom with other kids.\nSome sleepaway camps are coed. That means there are both boys and girls at the camp.
