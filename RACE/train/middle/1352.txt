It offered a packet of 100 mixed stamps for $10. Trudy wanted to start a stamp collection so she ordered the packet. One hundred mixed stamps seemed a good way to begin a collection. She sent a postal order to the stamp company with her order, and waited excitedly for the stamps arrived. Trudy checked the mail every day for four weeks but the stamps didn't arrive. So Trudy decided to write to the company. \"Dear Sir/Madam,\" she wrote, \"a month ago I sent you a postal order for $10 as payment for 100 mixed stamps. They haven't arrived. Please send them by return of mail.\" another month passed. The stamps still didn't arrive and she didn't receive any replay to her letter. She asked her father for advice. Her father said, \"You must write a stronger letter. Make the stamp company worry that you will report them to the authorities.\" \"Dear Sir/Madam,\" she wrote in her second letter. \"I am writing to complain about your poor service. Two months ago I sent you a postal order for $10 as payment for 100 mixed stamps. I didn't receive the stamps. A month ago I wrote to inform you of this. I still haven't received the stamps, and you haven't replied to my letter. If I do not receive the stamps within seven days. I shall report this matter to the authorities.\" Two days later Trudy received the stamps in the mail.", "id": "middle1352.txt"}
