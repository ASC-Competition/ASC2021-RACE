John is busy with his work during the day. When he passes by a flower shop in the evening, he thinks, 'I'll send Mum some roses  .' While John is looking at the flowers, a young man comes inside. 'How many roses can I buy for only five dollars , madam?' he asks. The shopkeeper tells him that a dozen of roses  is forty dollars. Maybe he can buy some carnations  . They are much cheaper.\n'No, I only want to have red roses,' he says. 'My mum was badly ill and I didn't spend much time with her. Now I want to give her something special, it must be roses because rose is her favorite.'\nAfter hearing it, John says he can help him pay for the rest   of the money. The shopkeeper is moved   and says, 'Well, lovely young men, thirty dollars a dozen, only for you.' Taking the roses, the young man almost jumps into the air and runs out of the shop. Then John pays for his dozen of roses and tells the shopkeeper to send them to his mother.\nAs he walks out, he feels nice. Suddenly he sees the young man crossing the street and going into a park. But soon John knows it is not a park but a cemetery  . Crying, the young man carefully puts down the roses, 'Mum, oh, Mum, why didn't I tell you how much I loved you? God, please help me find my mum and tell her I love her.'\nSeeing this, John turns and quickly walks to the shop. He will take the flowers home himself.", "id": "middle4333.txt"}
