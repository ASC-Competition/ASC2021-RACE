It is one of the world's most important wetlands*. The reserve offers food and places to live in for wildlife. It is an _ home for different kinds of plants, fish and birds.\nMany birds live comfortably in Zhalong Nature Reserve all year round, but some only stay there for a short time. There are many fish in the wetlands, and the birds can easily catch them for food. Zhalong Nature Reserve is an important living area for red-crowned cranes*. There are not many red-crowned cranes in the world. Some of them live in Zhalong.\nSome people want to change the wetlands to make more space for farms and buildings. This means there will be less and less space for wildlife.\nMore and more birds are in danger because they do not have enough living space. Many of them died. The Chinese government wants to protect these endangered* birds, and they can be safe in Zhalong.\nEvery year, a lot of visitors go to Zhalong to watch birds. This year, members of our Birdwatching Club are going to study the different kinds of birds in Zhalong and the changes in their numbers.\nWe do a bird count* once a year. We are now inviting middle school students to help. We need more people to help us count and do something to help the birds. Many people do not understand the importance* of the wetlands. We hope this information will help them understand and make them do something to protect wildlife.", "id": "middle6388.txt"}
