Then one day he walked into the water by himself and began to explore the bottom of the sea.\nHe saw a lot of beautiful fish and other things, and then, after half an hour, he suddenly saw a man waving his arms and legs around wildly near the bottom of the sea. He was wearing only a bathing suit.\nThe rich young man was very surprised to see him, so he took out a plastic notebook and a special pencil, which could write under water, and wrote, \"What are you doing here?\"\nHe showed the notebook to the other man, who then took the pencil and wrote, \"Drowning!\"", "id": "middle658.txt"}
