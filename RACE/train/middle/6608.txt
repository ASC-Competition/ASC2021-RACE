Mr. White bought the house two and a half years ago. Since his kids were growing up, he and his wife wanted to make some changes to the house.\nThey decided to knock down their living room wall to open up the space. When the wooden walls were moved, they were shocked to find a lizard   stuck in the small space between the walls. The lizard's foot was stuck by a nail   which was knocked into the wall from the other side several months ago. However, they wondered how the lizard had _ so long without moving from that place.\nThe family decided to wait for a while and see how the lizard survived several months without moving. While they were doing other things, they kept an eye on the lizard. The son, Ray, suddenly shouted, \"Dad, look here!\"\nAnother lizard appeared, carrying food to the stuck lizard's mouth. That was a real surprise! Everyone was touched that the lizard fed the other one for all this time.\nBoth lizards had never-ending hope for each other and carried their hearts with love and care. Why can't we humans always carry that kind of love in our hearts? Life is full of all kinds of difficulties. What we can do is to give our hand to the one in need and share our love. Sharing is caring.", "id": "middle6608.txt"}
