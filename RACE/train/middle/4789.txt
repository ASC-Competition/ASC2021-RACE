I go to the Movie Palace twice a month. It's about two kilometers from my home. The service is good. But the price of a ticket is a little expensive. I never go to Moon Cinema. It's about 10 kilometers from my home.\nI'm Jean. I go to Moon Cinema more often. There are often new movies on show and the screens are big. Most importantly, the price is cheaper. It's always half price for students, about 30 yuan. I go there once a week.\nI'm Jack. I live about 5 kilometers from Moon Cinema and 8 kilometers from Movie Palace. I think the seats in Moon Cinema are hard and the music is too loud. So I prefer to go to Movie Palace. I go to Movie Palace once a month.\nI'm Lucy. I prefer to go to Movie Palace. It's in the center of the city and is very modern. I like shopping and there are some shopping centers around. I go there once a month.", "id": "middle4789.txt"}
