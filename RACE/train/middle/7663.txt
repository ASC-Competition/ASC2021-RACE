He wanted his sons to learn not to judge  things too quickly. So he told them to go and look at a pear tree. It was far away from his home. The first son went in winter, the second in spring, the third in summer, and the youngest son in autumn.\nWhen the sons came back, the old man asked them to say what they had seen. The first son complained the tree was ugly. The second son said the tree was covered with buds  and full of hope. The third son said the tree was full of green leaves. They looked so beautiful, and it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen. The youngest son said that the tree was bowed  down with heavy fruits. It was full of life and fulfillment .\nThe man explained that all of his sons were right, but each of them had seen just one season of the tree. He told them that they couldn't judge a tree or a person by only one season. \"If you give up when it's winter, you will miss the hope of your spring, the beauty of your summer, and the fulfillment of your autumn.\" said the old man.\nIt is true that we shouldn't let the hard season break the happiness of the other seasons. Never give up during the difficult days and better times are sure to come some day.", "id": "middle7663.txt"}
