His name was Mr. Basille. He wore a white cap and drove a white truck.\nOf course, he delivered   more than milk. There was cheese, eggs and so on. If we needed to change our order, my mother would write a note -- \"Please add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery\". Then she put the note and the empty bottles into the milk box. The next day, the buttermilk would magically appear.\nThere was also a close relationship between families and their milkmen. Mr. Basille even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box in the house, so that the milk wouldn't freeze. And I remember Mr. Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table, having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery.\nI am sad that there is no home milk delivery today. Big companies produce cheaper milk, and milk is for sale everywhere. People may not need the milkman anymore.\nRecently, I saw an old milk box in the countryside and it brought back my childhood memories. I took it home and put it outside the door. My son's friends always ask what it is. So I start telling stories of my boyhood, and of the milkman who brought us friendship with his milk.", "id": "middle726.txt"}
