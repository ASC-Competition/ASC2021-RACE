He called it \"Shaolin Sunshine Hand\". It allows him to get enough energy with his fists   to put out candles up to three meters away.\nI used to watch those Chinese kungfu films during the 80s and 90s. I used to love seeing kungfu actors make things far away with their fists, but at that time I knew it was not true. However, after I watched the video, I changed my idea. The video went very popular in China recently. It showed that the young man named Zhang Feng put out 15 candles in a line three meters away with air or energy generated by his flying fists.\nYou may say it's not true, and you're not the only one. But the young man actually invited two reporters from The Zhengzhou Evening News newspaper into his home to see his act and then film him doing it. The two reporters tried their best, but were only able to put out one of the 15 candles set 10 cm apart, and even blowing air didn't put out all the candles. Zhang Feng, on the other hand, put them all out just by throwing punches. The two reporters were _ and couldn't explain how he did it. They said that Zhang Feng was a great Shaolin master.", "id": "middle4057.txt"}
