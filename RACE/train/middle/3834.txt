All skirts will be banned from September at Paget High School in Branston. Tight-fitting  trousers will also be banned and Muslim head-dressed will have to be \"School blue\" colour.\nHead teacher Don Smith said, \"one of the big problems for us at the school has been the number of girls who have been wearing improperly  short skirts. This has been an area of special concern at a time when there have been a lot of wrong ideas of being beautiful.\" Mr Smith said it would be impossible to determine  how long girls' skirts should be and that _ would be easier for teachers to carry out.\nThe head teacher said pupils' and other teachers' opinions were asked for before the new rule was set. The new clothing policy  has been explained in a letter sent to parents of the school's 1,000 pupils and will come into force after the summer holiday.\nThe school also wants pupils to wear clip-on ties  instead of traditional neckwear. This rule will be gradually out over the next year and support will be given to parents unable to afford the new tie.\nOne parent, whose teenage daughter studies at school, said, \"I completely agree some girls were wearing skirts that were too short. However, I think girls should be allowed to wear skirts. Other school manage to let girls wear skirts while making sure they are not improperly dressed. I don't see why Paget can't do the same\"", "id": "middle3834.txt"}
