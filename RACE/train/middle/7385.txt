We look forward to success to show us our value or to be the top of the group wherever we are. How many times in our schooling did we hope for a high mark? We want it and then feel like a failure when we don't achieve what we want. Even when we succeed we still pass that and go onto the next success and then the next. We are not often taught how to face failures.\nFor me, failure taught me more than success did. Success is of the moment and temporary but failure means we have ever done. It makes me stop and think. It opened my eyes and brain to different possibilities. Failure is just a choice in redoing not in giving up. Experiencing failure,I looked deeper and further.\nI have a grandson who plays hockey  and as all players do,he went through a _ . So I saw he was unhappy with himself. Then I said to him, \"Why don't you think of it differently rather than being unhappy?\" And I asked, \"Scoring is your goal, right?\" He answered,\"Of course.\" \"Why aren't you scoring now? Do you need a readjustment ?\"All of a sudden he calmed down--he was thinking of what I had just said. So in the next game I saw him trying different things to do better. Later he started scoring. Now when something is wrong, he takes the time to think it over rather than just keeping the \"failure\" mode .\nLook at failure differently. Failure is what gives us power to try a different way of doing things.\nIt teaches us to rethink, redo, and then success will come about. Don't give up but learn to use a different way.", "id": "middle7385.txt"}
