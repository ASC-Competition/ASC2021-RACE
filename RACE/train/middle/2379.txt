Read and choose the best.\nReporter:Mr Shum, you were one of Taiwan's most outstanding youths last year. Why was that?\nMr Shum:Well, I can tell you that there are two reasons.First, I am a painter. Second, and more important reason is I am handicapped . I have no arms and only one leg.\nReporter:Well, how do you paint then if you've got no arms? Do you use your foot?\nMr Shum:Hah! For some handicapped people, it's true and they are able to use their feet.No,I use my mouth. I put my paintbrush or my crayons or pencils or whatever I am using in my mouth. I hold it _ in my teeth and paint or draw like that. It was a little strange for me at first, but it quickly became very easy.\nReporter:I know you feel that you are first a painter and only secondly that you are a disablbed person, but can we talk first about your handicap?\nMr Shum:Well,in fact I think of myself firstly as a person, secondly as a painter and thirdly as someone with a physical handicap. Can I say that I am not happy with the word \"handicapped\"?\nI am a popular painter because my paintings are good, not because they were painted by a handicapped person. \"handicapped\"means you can't do anything. It is difficult for me to do some things like getting dressed.\nReporter: Were you born with your handicap?\nMr Shum:No. An accident happened to me when I was 15 years old.After that I became depressed and even tried to end my life, but my mother was always there for me.", "id": "middle2379.txt"}
