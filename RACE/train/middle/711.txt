So people often made a mistake and telephoned her when they wanted the cinema.\nOne evening the telephone rang and Mrs. Green answered it. A tired man said, \"At what time your last film begin?\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" said Mrs. Green, \"but you have the wrong number. This is not the cinema.\" \"Oh. It began twenty minutes ago,\" said the man, \"I am sorry about that. Goodbye.\" Mrs. Green was very surprised, so she told her husband.

Now they will stay at home this evening and the husband will be happy.\"", "id": "middle711.txt"}
