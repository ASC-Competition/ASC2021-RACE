He saw so much snow in the garden. Mr. Smith wanted to take his car out, so he asked a man to clean the road from his garage   to the gate. He said to the man, \"Don't throw any snow on the side. It will damage  the flowers in my garden, and don't throw any on the other side, because it will damage the wall. And don't throw any into the street, because the policeman will come.\" Then he went out.\nWhen he came back, the road was clean. There was no snow on the flowers, or the wall or the street.
