Does it make sense to you? Does it look like anything?\nAbstract art became popular in the early 20th century. Artists did not want to paint, draw, or sculpt things like they looked. They didn't want their art to be realistic  . They were more interested in basic shapes  and colours.\nPicasso is probably the most famous of these artists. He painted and drew in many, many styles. Sometimes he used a lot of blue colours (his \"blue period\"). Later, he used more red and pink colours (his \"rose period\"). Many of his other paintings are called \"cubist  \" because they are made of painted squares.\nAfter a long time, Picasso's paintings became more and more abstract. He painted people and things using strange shapes. His work was so original, many his fellow artists didn't understand it.\nKindinsky, another famous artist, used lines, shapes, and patterns to paint his subjects. His paintings also used strong colours to express feelings.\nOther artists like the surrealists  , they were interested in the subconscious  . Painters like Breton and Magritte used many symbols   in their work. The meaning or subject of their work wasn't always clear. Dai, another artist, painted pictures that looked like dreams.\nThere are still many abstract artists around the world. It's often hard to say what their art is about. That's the way many artists like better. They want each person to look at art and find their own meaning in it.", "id": "middle5848.txt"}
