The government encourages local people to ride bikes in order to solve the traffic problem.\nMore than 12,000 people have agreed to the idea. Some of them ask for more than one key. Although there are not enough bikes, an official  from the government said that they would find some ways to deal with such a shortage.\nLocal people can get these bikes at special docking stations .There are about 315 docking stations across the city. About 12,450 keys have already been handed out to the local people, but only 6,000 keys can be used now.\nLet's see the cost you need to pay. One key costs PS3, and the cost of using the bike is PS1 for an hour. The cost per hour increases as the hours increase, so it will cost PS50 if you rent the bike for 24 hours.\nThe official from the government said they also needed to face a lot of problems, for example, some bikes may be lost. But they said they would try their best to solve all the problems to make sure the success of the program.", "id": "middle3443.txt"}
