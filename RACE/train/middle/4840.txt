Two of her new ESL (English as a Second Language) classmates wanted to know where Tara was from. They were both from Korea. Because Tara looked Korean, one of the women asked Tara, in English, if she was from Korea. Tara replied, \"No, I'm not.\" Then the women took turns asking Tara if she was from Japan, or Thailand, or China. To each question, Tara answered them a simple no. Laughing, one woman said to the other, \"She's not from anywhere!\" The two went to their desks, talking to each other in Korean.\nThe next day, the teacher divided the students into groups of four. The students in each group asked introductory questions of each other. A student in Tara's group asked her, \"Where are you from?\" Tara answered that she was from Korea. The two women who had questioned Tara the day before were sitting only a few feet away. Both of them heard Tara's answer.\n\"Aha!\" they both _ , \"You ARE from Korea!\" Tara smiled and said yes. Then she apologized to both of them for lying the day before. She told them that she had not wanted to get into a Korean conversation with them. It had been her experience that many ESL students continued to speak their mother language in ESL class, and Tara had not come to ESL class to practice her Korean. In her opinion, ESL students should try to speak English only.\n\"I agree.\" said Rose.\n\"You're 100 percent right.\" agreed Jenny, \"Rose and I must stop speaking Korean to each other. Right,Rose?\" Rose nodded,and then said something in Korean. All three women laughed.\nThe next half a year, Tara became friendly with both women, although she never spoke a word of Korean to them during class or break.", "id": "middle4840.txt"}
