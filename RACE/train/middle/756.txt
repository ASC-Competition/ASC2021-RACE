But in Rome, Italy, there is a campaign called Save the Beach that has created a hotel out of 12 tons of trash in order to raise awareness   of our waste.\nSave the Beach is an environmental awareness campaign set up by the makers of Corona Beer. They collected all the trash from all the beaches all across Europe. Then they built the special hotel.\nIt was reported that the hotel was fully booked  . And it was open only for four days there in early June, the same time as World Environment Day. Next to the \"trash hotel\" was the slogan of Save the Beach. It said, we have built the first hotel made of trash in the world. This will be the future of our holidays if we do nothing to protect our beaches.\nThe hotel was built just to show the _ we were causing to the sea and the coastline  . We live in the time of trash and we are running the risk of becoming trash ourselves. Do we really want such a world?\nThe trash hotel in Rome was just the beginning to support healthy, clean and trash-free beaches all across Europe by Save the Beach. Maybe there will be more surprising ideas in the future. Let's wait and see.", "id": "middle756.txt"}
