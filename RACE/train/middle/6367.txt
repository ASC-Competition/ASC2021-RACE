In one hand was a plastic phone, in the other a toy broom. I listened as she was speaking to her imaginary friend and I'll never forget the words she said, even though it was pretend .\nShe said, \"Suzie's in the corner because she's not been very good. She didn't listen to a word I said or do the things she should.\" In the corner I saw her baby doll all dressed in lace and pink. It was obvious she'd been put there to sit alone and think.\nMy daughter continued her \"conversation,\"  as I sat down on the floor. She said, \"I'm all fed up, I just don't know what to do with her anymore. She cries whenever I have to work and wants to play games, too. She never lets me do the things that I just have to do.\nShe tries to help me with the dishes, but her arms just cannot reach and she doesn't know how to fold towels. I don't have the energy to teach. I have a lot of work to do and a big house to keep clean. I don't have the time to sit and play. Don't you know what I mean?\"\nAnd that day I thought a lot about making some changes in my life, as I listened to her innocent  words that cut me like a knife. I hadn't been paying enough attention to what I hold most dear.\nBut now my attitude has changed, because, in my heart, I realize I've seen the world in a different light through my little darling's eyes. So, let the cobwebs   have the corners and the dust bunny rabbit rule the floor, I'm not going to worry about keeping up with them  anymore .\nI'm going to fill the house with memories of a child and her mother, for we have only one childhood, and we will never get another.", "id": "middle6367.txt"}
