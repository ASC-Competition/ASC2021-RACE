He can run very fast and likes to show people how fast he can run. One day, a thief got into his house, took some of his things and ran out of  the house fast. Mr Brown found it and ran after him, and shouted, \"Hey! Don't you know you can't get away from me.\"But the thief ran much faster, Mr Brown got angry and ran faster, too. He was soon a few kilometers away from his house, he was running hard when he met me. \"Why are you running so fast?\" I asked. \"I want to catch a thief,\" said Mr Brown. \"But where is the thief?\" I asked. \"Kilometers and kilometers behind,\" said Mr Brown _ , \"He thought he could run faster than me, but you see he is wrong.\"", "id": "middle5835.txt"}
