Play near the hut .\"\n\"Mama, may I go a little way in the woods to pick blackberries ?\" he asked one day. \"All right,\" his mother said, \"but do not go very far.\" So Dhon went to the woods. He was happy to hear the birds singing in the trees. He _ some blackberries in his pockets.\nThen Dhon tried to catch some beautiful butterflies. He chased them far into the woods. He ran and he jumped. He forget he had to go back home. By that time the sun had set. Dhon was frightened.

I want to go home to my mother,\" replied Dhon. \"Don't cry, little boy, I will take you home. Follow me. But you must promise never to catch me.\"\nDhon promised and followed the firefly through the trees.
