The experimental program was designed to test how 50 students ages 13 and 14 at the Bohunt School in Hampshire would deal with a completely Chinese teaching method. With long school days and tough rules, it's considered to be \"strict\" to Westerners.\nIt took the BBC six months to choose suitable Chinese teachers. They had to be English, math, science or social science teachers with more than five years teaching experience in China. They also had to be able to teach in English. Though language was not a problem for the Chinese teachers, they weren't used to the difference between Chinese and British students. Li Aiyun from the Nanjing Foreign Language School told British media that when she handed out homework sheets, she expected the students to _ on their homework. \"But when I walked in the classroom, some students were chatting, some students were eating, somebody was even putting make-up on her face. I had to control myself, or I would be crazy. About half of them tried their best to follow me. And the other half ? Who knows what they were doing?\" she said.\nWhile Rosie Lunskey, 15, told BBC interviewers that she found it difficult to get used to the Chinese teachers. \"Acting like robots was the right way to go. I'm used to speaking my mind in class, giving ideas, often working in groups to develop my skills and improve my knowledge. But a lot of the time in the experiment, the only thing I felt I was learning was how to copy notes really fast and listen to the teacher, \"she complained.", "id": "middle6739.txt"}
