It can make you confident when you are studying. But unluckily, most students don't know how to take notes.\nWrite down key facts. If your teacher writes notes on the blackboard, that's great. You can copy them or write down the most important facts of all in class. Different teachers do things differently. For example, some teachers may focus on   lots of dates and facts in class, but they only write the important ones on the blackboard. Other teachers may not write anything down, but they may say something important again and again.\nAsk. Don't be afraid to ask your teacher to repeat what you miss. If your teacher speaks too fast and you can't follow what he is saying, you can ask him after class.\nCompare. Comparing your notes with your classmates' can be good for your learning. It can also help you and your classmates correct some mistakes.\nOrganize . Note-taking also needs organization. Keep notes for each subject in one notebook, so that you can find everything easily when a test comes.\nGood note-taking takes time. If you decide to recopy your notes every evening, you'll surely have less time to watch TV. But you'll save time in the coming test.", "id": "middle3889.txt"}
