He's happy that he's sitting the senior high school entrance exam   in 2014 instead of 2016.\nOn Oct 22, Beijing Municipal Commission of Education   announced that, from 2016, the English scores in the senior high school entrance exam will be reduced from 120 to 100. Of the 100 points, the listening ability scores will increase to 50. Meanwhile, the points for Chinese will increase from 120 to 150.\n\"The change won't affect me. I feel so lucky because English is my strongest subject,\" said Wang.\nWhy such a change? It places the importance on Chinese in our study, and reduces students' stress, said Li Yi, spokesman of the commission.\n\"The change will also push us to pay attention to the practical usage   of English,\" said Li. \"Students will be encouraged to learn to understand English menus and read English news on mobile phones.\"\nThere isn't news that other cities will have the same change. But several places are making changes to English tests in the college entrance exams. For example, Shandong is considering taking out the listening part of the English exam in its college entrance exams.\nBut, \"being tested for less points doesn't mean the subject _ ,\" Bai Ping wrote in China Daily.\nEnglish has long been the world's most commonly used language. Former Chinese premier Zhu Rongji once said: \"In a globalizing economy  , if you cannot communicate with foreigners, how can one be part of the world economy?\"\nWang Jiaming said he understood the change.\n\"Chinese, not English, is our mother tongue  ,\" he said. \"But still, I think English is both interesting and useful.\"", "id": "middle2818.txt"}
