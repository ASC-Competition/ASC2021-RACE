There the fox met him and said, \"Why do you hang your head, and go about all alone?\"\n\"Alas,\" replied the horse, \" My master has forgotten what services I have done for him for so many years, and because I can no longer plow  well, he will give me no more food, and has driven me out. \"\n\" Without giving you a chance?\" asked the fox.\n\" The chance was a bad one. He said , if I were still strong enough to bring him a lion , he would keep me , but he knows that I cannot do that. \"\nThe fox said, \"I will help you. Just lie down, _ as if you were dead. \" The horse did as the fox asked, and then the fox went to the lion, and said, \"A dead horse is lying out there. Just come with me, and you can have a rich meal. \"\nThe lion went with him, and when they were both standing by the horse, the fox said, \"After all, it is not very comfortable for you here--l tell you what--l will fasten it to you by the tail, and then you can pull it into your cave and eat it in peace. \"\nThe advice pleased the lion. He positioned himself in order that the fox might tie the horse fast to him, and he kept completely quiet. But the fox tied the lion's legs together with the horse's tail. When he had finished his work , he tapped the horse on the shoulder and said, \"Pull, white horse, pull! \"\nThen up sprang  the horse at once, and pulled the lion away with him. The lion began to roar  so that all the birds in the forest flew up in fear, but the horse let him roar, and drew him and pulled him across the field to his master's door. When the master saw the lion, he was moved, and said to the horse, \" You shall stay with me and I will treat you well. \" And he gave him plenty to eat until he died.\n,.", "id": "middle3564.txt"}
