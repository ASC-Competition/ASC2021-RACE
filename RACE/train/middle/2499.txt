You can't see it on the map of China, because it is too small. The air here is very fresh .\nThere are not many tall buildings in our town. The tallest building is in our school. There are five hundred students and twenty-five teachers in our school.\nIn the front of the school, there is a playground. I often play basketball with my classmates on it. There is a little garden behind our school. And we can grow   beautiful flowers and plant trees there. Next to the garden, there is an orange orchard . You can hear birds singing everywhere.\nThere is a river not far from our school. In summer, we usually go swimming with our teachers in it. We study Chinese, English, Maths and other subjects at school. The teachers are very nice. We love our school.\nDo you like my town? I hope you can come here to have a look.", "id": "middle2499.txt"}
