Tuesday is not so bad. I usually play tennis with my friends after school. On Wednesday evening I don't go out. I stay at home and do my homework. I like Thursday because the next day is Friday. I always go out on Friday--maybe to the cinema. I love the weekend. On Saturdays I get up late, and I sometimes go to the shops in the afternoon. In the evening we go to a club. Then on Sundays I go to my friend's house or she comes to mine. I usually visit my grandmother for an hour in the afternoon. Then the weekend is over and it's Monday...and I feel bad again!", "id": "middle60.txt"}
