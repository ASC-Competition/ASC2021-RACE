He stops to look at the front row of shoes, and he feels happy to see that the pair of shoes he wants very much is still there. Looking down at his old shoes, he feels sorry for himself. He really wants to have them for his birthday.\nHe sadly walks away and thinks how to tell his mother about it. He knows very well she has little money. He decides not to go home at once , as he looks sad and his mother will notice  it. So he goes to the park and sits on the grass. There he sees a boy moving a wheelchair with his hands . Tom looks at him and is surprised to see that the boy has no feet. He looks at his own feet. \"It's much better to be without shoes than without feet\", he thinks. There is no reason or him to feel so sorry and sad. He goes away and smiles, thinking he is happier.", "id": "middle969.txt"}
