The A, B and C dances can be experienced in any order. This is the main difference between Square Dance ABC and the traditional \"lesson-based\" way. You can do the three beginner's dances in any order.\nInstead of waiting until a class starts once a year, people can start Square Dance ABC any time!\nAfter all three dances (in an order), dancers have learned 22 square dance movements. The next step is the experienced ABC dance, using all 22 movements.\nIt is easy to convince people to try square dancing any time. Most people that try it will like it. Square Dance ABC will bring lots of opportunities  for fun, fitness and friends!\nCome on, we'll make this project as easy as A-B-C!\nIf you have questions or comments about this site, please e-mail us at Webmaster@Square Dance ABC.com.", "id": "middle2156.txt"}
