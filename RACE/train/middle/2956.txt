But there is a great way to _ after all of those activities. Go to north London, to the coolest part of the city---Camden. There you can find fashion trends (,) and famous people.\nSam and I walked down Camden High Street and made our way to a bridge over Regent's Canal. It is a 9-mile man-made river that goes through London.\nWe went into a big market and saw crazy signs, fun T-shirts, and things like hand-made earrings for sale. We bought Chinese fried noodles. It tasted very different from the noodles we make at home, and we ate it with a fork instead of chopsticks!\nCamden is famous for the punk style that started in the 1970s. Punks walked around with bright pink and green hair, broken clothes with safety pins, metal buttons and pierced ears and lips. Punk music shops played loud, heavy rock music.\nBut there were also groups of hippies with big sweaters. They sat in cafes drinking soymilk, with black clothes, black lipstick and painted white faces.\nBesides all these \"normal\" people, a lot of famous people come to Camden. Actor Orlando Bloom from Pirates of the Caribbean lives there.\nCamden is especially known as a home to famous musicians. Lots of top bands played here, including Coldplay, Oasis---and Sam's favourite band, The Vaccines. I had never heard of them before---But luckily they were playing that night in Camden.", "id": "middle2956.txt"}
