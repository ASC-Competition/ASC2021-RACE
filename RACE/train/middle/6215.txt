It is used in foods around the world such as cakes, bread, frozen meats, fish and vegetables. In the beginning, people thought MSG was safe just like salt and sugar. However, in 1968 some people reported they seemed to have bad reactions   to MSG after having had a meal at a restaurant. They included headaches and quick heartbeat  . It was also reported that MSG excited a person's brain and caused his death in Japan. Scientists think that MSG may lead to many neurological disorders  . In mice studies done by a university, the evidence showed the mice didn't want to eat the food including MSG.\nToday many food companies \"hide\" MSG on food labels   by using different names. If you see \"natural flavorings\", \"hydrolyzed protein\" and \"spices\" in a food label, you are probably seeing a hidden way to \"report\" MSG in a food label. Every time we have a meal in a restaurant, we always feel the food very delicious to taste, but sometimes it is dangerous for our health because some poisonous food additives have been added to the food.\nTo protect people's health, our governments, from central to local, are taking actions to stop factories producing poisonous food additives.", "id": "middle6215.txt"}
