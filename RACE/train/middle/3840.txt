He flew into the water, not noticing  \nthat in the middle of the lake, a crocodile   was swimming to the bank. His mother in the house saw the two as they got closer and closer. She quickly ran to the lake, shouting to her son as loudly as she could.\nHearing her voice, the little boy swam quickly to his mother, but he was too slow. Just as he reached her, the crocodile reached him, too.\nThe mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the crocodile caught his legs. There was a tug of war   between the two. The crocodile was much stronger than the mother, but the mother didn't give up. A farmer happened to drive by. He heard her shouts, and then tried his best to kill the crocodile.\nAfter spending weeks in the hospital, the little boy felt well. His legs were scarred   by the animal and on his arms there were deep scars, too. His mother's hands had deeper scars because she wouldn't let go.\nThe newspaper reporter interviewed the boy. He asked the boy if he would show him his scars. The boy said to the reporter proudly, \"Look at my arms. I have great scars on my arms. I have them because my mom wouldn't let go.\"", "id": "middle3840.txt"}
