Whenever she took me out for shopping, I found she wouldn't take any notice of the shop assistants when they suggested that some dresses were popular. She would say, \"We're not interested in that. Haven't you got anything a little unusual?\" And then the assistants would bring out all the strange colours no one else would buy. And later she and I would argue because I wanted to be ordinary but my mother wanted to be unusual.\n\"I can't stand that hairdo  ,\" she said to me when I was in a boy hairstyle, \" _ 's so terribly ordinary... Not ugly, not unsuitable. But ordinary ...\"\n\"Couldn't you please wear something else?\" I asked one day when she was dressing for Parents' Day in tight   trousers and a bright pink sweater.\n\"What't wrong with it!\"\n\"It's just that I wish you'd wear something ordinary.\" I said, \"People won't laugh at.\"\nShe looked at me angrily, \"Are you ashamed of your mother?
