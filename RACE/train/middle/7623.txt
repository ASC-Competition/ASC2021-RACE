But my daddy can't pay for it, so I have brought all my money.\"\n\"How much do you have?\" asked the man.\n\"$ 1.11, but I can try and get some more,\" she answered.\n\"Well, what luck,\" smiled the man. \"$ 1.11, the price of a miracle for little brothers.\" He took up the girl's hand and said, \"Take me to where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents. Let's see if I have the kind of miracle you need.\"\nThat well-dressed man was Dr Carlton Armstrong, a famous doctor.
