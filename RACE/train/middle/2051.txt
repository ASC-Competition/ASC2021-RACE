She got up and down her bed by herself, walked to the bedroom door and opened it. She looked outside and walked back, for it was so dark in the living room that she feared. Her mother told her not to be afraid and take courage.\n\" What is courage? Do you have courage?\" She asked, running to her mother's bed. \" Courage is the brave breath . I have it.\" Her mother answered. The girl held out her little hands and asked her mother to give her. After her mother blew out two mouthfuls of breath into her little cold hands, the little girl clenched her fists nervousely, afraid that the \"breath of courage\" would run away. Then with her fists clenched, she walked out of the bedroom towards the bathroom with nothing to fear.\nHer mother said to herself, \" It'll be nice if someone can blow some kind of breath to me. Then I can hold it in my hands too when I feel terrified or lost.\nIn fact, mostly, what we are terrified of is nothing but the fear in our mind. Who we should deal with is nobody but ourselves.", "id": "middle2051.txt"}
