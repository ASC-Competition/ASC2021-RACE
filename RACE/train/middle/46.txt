One holiday, they decided to go to London together. They went to the station and bought their tickets.\nMichael got on the train first. He dropped his ticket on the platform when he got into the carriage. Dick, who was close behind, saw the ticket fall and quickly picked it up. He put it in his pocket, but didn't tell Michael. After they had been in the train for a while, they heard the conductor coming down the corridor, shouting, \"Tickets, please!\" Michael looked for his ticket and of course couldn't find it.\n\"Oh dear, I can't find my ticket, Dick,\" Michael said.\n\"Look for it carefully, Michael; it must be somewhere.\" said Dick.\n\"No, I can't find it anywhere.

At this time, the conductor came in. \"Tickets, please,\" he said. Dick handed him tow tickets and said, \"This is mine. The other is my friend's. But he prefers to stay under the seat.\"", "id": "middle46.txt"}
