His father was a painter and art teacher who gave his son the first lesson in drawing. He won a prize-- \"Science and Charity\" for his first important painting when he was only fifteen. He studied in several cities in Spain. But there was no one to teach him all that he wanted to know. When he was nineteen, he visited Paris.\nParis was then the center of the world for artists. Everything that was new and exciting in the world of paintings seemed to happen there. When he was twenty-three, Picasso moved there to live and lived in France for the rest of his life.\nWhen he was over ninety, this great painter still lived his life like a young man. He was still looking for new ideas and new ways to use his artistic materials.\nWhen he died in 1973, he was ninety-one years old.\n.", "id": "middle5513.txt"}
