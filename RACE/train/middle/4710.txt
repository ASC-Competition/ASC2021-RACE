Rick told him that his flat was on the first floor. When he arrived, Simon went straight to the first floor of the building. But he was told that there was no Rick on that floor. Do you know why?\nIn fact, the British call the first floor of a building the ground floor. The floor above the ground floor is the first floor, while Americans would call it the second floor.\nThe story shows that there are a few culture differences between Britain and America, though the British and Americans both speak English.\nThe British usually hide their feelings. They seldom start a conversation with strangers. For example, on the train the British often spend their time reading newspapers or books. But Americans are quite different. They're more active and easier to talk with.\nThe British and Americans may use different _ for many things. The British usually use \"football\", \"eraser\" and \"mail\" while Americans prefer to use \"soccer\", \"rubber\" and \"post\".", "id": "middle4710.txt"}
