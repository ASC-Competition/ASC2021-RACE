Within a few days, the whole village knew the story. The person she talked about was deeply hurt and angry.\nLater, the woman spreading the rumor  learned that it was completely untrue. She was very sorry and went to a wise man to find out what she could do to repair the harm.\n\"Go to the marketplace,\" he said, \"buy a chicken, and have it killed. Then on your way home, pick its feathers and drop them one by one along the road.\" Although surprised by this advice, the woman did what she was told.\nThe next day the wise man said, \"Now, go and collect all those feathers you dropped yesterday and bring them back to me.\"\nThe woman followed the same road, but she was so _ when she found the wind had blown the feathers all away. After searching for hours, she returned with only three in her hand.\n\"You see,\" said the wise man, \"it's easy to drop them, but it is impossible to get them all back. So it is the same with gossip. It doesn't take much to spread a rumor, but once you do, you can never completely undo( ) the wrong.\"", "id": "middle656.txt"}
