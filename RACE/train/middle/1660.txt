Take pictures\nOne of the great things about taking pictures at an event or a party is that it gives you an excuse to get in touch with the person later. Everybody loves seeing pictures of themselves, and it's very easy after taking a picture to say \"If you'd like I can email it to you\". This can be the seed that leads to new connections.\n2. Eat alone in public\nYou might feel self-conscious eating by yourself but it has an important benefit: you are much easier to approach  when you are alone. People may be afraid of disturbing you or being rude if you talk with someone else. Bring a book or newspaper to read. Plus, having an interesting book with you will give others an excuse tostart a conversation if they've read it.\n3. Join a class, sports team, or club\nYoga, salsa dancing, volleyball, Toastmasters (a public speaking club), a class for work, etc. Choose a new hobby or continue an old one!\nThese are all great places to meet new people, primarily because you will be made to see the same people over and over again in the class. You will automatically make friends with them if you have a common interest and are made to see each other again.", "id": "middle1660.txt"}
