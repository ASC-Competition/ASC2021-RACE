Here are some strategies   for you.\nStrategy One\n*Each week, choose one day when you don't eat meat. Meat takes up lots of energy because it takes a long time to produce. And animals must be fed on farmed plants, which could be used to feed many more people.\nStrategy Two\n*Only buy the amount of food you need. When you buy food, go local rather than imported  , and get fresh vegetables instead of frozen.\nStrategy Three\n*Make sure you keep the things such as paper and plastic bottles separate   so that they can be recycled. There are places where you can recycle batteries. Make sure you find them.\nStrategy Four\n*Take showers rather than baths and reduce your shower time by two minutes. This will save water and give you an extra two minutes in bed.\nStrategy Five\n*Buses and trains are better than cars, but walking or cycling is better still. It's also better for your health and cheaper. It can even be quicker than sitting in a car at rush hours in a busy city. For long distances, coaches are better than trains.\nStrategy Six\n*Try to buy good, long-lasting products even though they may cost a little more. A small screen TV is better than a big screen. Keep your electronic products one year longer than you would usually have.", "id": "middle7985.txt"}
