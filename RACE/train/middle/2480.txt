Instead, they are talking about a lovely animal--a dog! These words show the friendship between people and animals. Dogs and other pets can give joy to people's lives. _ \nAnimals can help people, too. You can teach dogs to be the 'eyes' for blind   people or 'ears' for deaf   people. Scientists have found that pets help people live longer! They make people happier, too. Because of that, they bring animals into hospitals for 'visits'.\nAmericans have 'Be Kind to Animals Week' in the first week of May. There are many pet shows during the week. Even if you don't live in America, you can also show your love to animals. How? First think about how animals make your life richer  . If you have a pet, take more time this week to play with it. Remember to give it nice food. If you don't have a pet, be kind to\nanimals around you. For example, if you see a street dog, don't kick it. Just leave it alone, or make friends with it. If others around you do bad things to animals, try to stop them. As people, we must protect   animals because they can't speak for themselves.", "id": "middle2480.txt"}
