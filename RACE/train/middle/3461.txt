Students are ready for their after-school math lesson. Thousands of kilometers away, their math tutors are also arriving for class. Each pupil gets an online tutor. The students work on their computer screen and wear a headset   to talk to their tutor.\nTheir classroom teacher, Altus, says he has seen an improvement in results. Nine-year-old Samia says she enjoys the online lessons. She said, \"It helps me because sometimes when we're doing it in class, I don't hear the teacher very much and I don't understand, but online is better.\"\nTom Hooper started the company. It provides the online tutoring. The company is called Bright Spark Education.\nChildren today feel very confident online, so they enjoy their learning. Online tutoring costs between twenty and twenty-five dollars an hour. An online tutor is about half the cost of traditional face-to-face tutoring.\nBright Spark Education says the online tutoring is used only as an addition to the regular teaching. The company says its service doesn't _ the teachers' jobs in Britain.\nSome parents say they are pleased with the results. But some students still hate math.
