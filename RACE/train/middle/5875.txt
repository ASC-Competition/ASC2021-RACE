About 97% of water on the earth is sea water, or salty  water. Man can only drink or use the other 3% of the fresh water  which comes from rivers, lakes and underground.\nThe sea is very big. Look at the map of the world, there is more sea than land. It covers  quarters of the earth, it looks very beautiful when the sun is shinning on it. But it can be terrible when there is a strong wind. Some parts of the sea are very deep. There is one place near Japan. It's nearly 11 kilometers high. If we put that mountain into the sea at that place, there would be 2 kilometers of water above it!\nThe sea is salty. There is one \"sea\" called the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is not a sea. It's a big lake in the Jordan Valley. It's the saltiest. It's near the city of Jericho. It's about 80.kilometres long, between 4.8 and 17.7 kilometers wide. The river Jordan runs into the Dead Sea. The sun is not there and the water is salty. Fish can't live in the Dead Sea and plants can't grow near it. People can't swim well in the Dead Sea, but they can float  on the water. The water is very blue and the air is clean. In winter, people come to the Dead Sea to enjoy the sunshine.", "id": "middle5875.txt"}
