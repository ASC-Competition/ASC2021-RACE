When did it start? Maybe you can find the background of the awards in the following passage.\nThe awards started in 1929. Their full title is \"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards\". The Academy is a group of people who have worked in the film industry for many years. They decide who will receive the awards. The awards are often referred to as the \"Oscar\". This is a nickname given to the awards by a lady called Margaret Herrick. She was once the director of the Academy and she once said that the little gold statue  reminded her of her uncle Oscar!\nThe Oscar is always an exciting event. Each year, at least one unusual thing happens. When the Italian actor and director Roberto Benigni won an Oscar for best foreign film, he danced on stage! When Gwyneth Paltrow, the star of Shakespeare in Love won the Oscar for best actress, she could not make her acceptance speech because she was crying so much with happiness!\nIn 1987, Roberto Benigni won the award for best director for a film about the last emperor of China. Since then, Chinese film and actors have started to make an impact at the award. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a huge success and it won the award for best foreign language film in 2001. It also won several technical awards for its amazing \"flying\" people. We expect to see more awards for Chinese film in the near future.\nIt's time for the Oscar again. Once more, the stars will dress up in their finest and go to Kodak Theater. There, they will find out who had won the awards for best actor, best actress and best director. Millions of people watch the awards every year to find out who the winners are. Some people watch it to see the stars crying and laughing as they receive their awards.", "id": "middle2085.txt"}
