When you reach one thousand, you'll be asleep.\" The next day the man came back to the doctor's office. \"Well,\" said the doctor, \"How are you today?\"\n\"Yes, he said,\" I tried counting one, two, three. . . up to  one thousand. But when I reached five hundred and sixty-nine, I began to feel sleepy  . I had to get up and drank some tea. Then I went on counting up to one thousand.
