Jenny, 13, a US student, feels bored. She knows the feeling because she has been in hospital many times herself. One day, she thought of an idea--if patients could get some books to read, they would feel better. So, from May, she and many of her friends began to collect books for hospital patients.\nIn six months the students collected 1,250 books at school. They decided to donate the books to the North Shore Medical Centre, a children's hospital next door to their school. \"There are books for kids of all ages, from babies up to high school level.\" said Jenny.\nThe students put the books into \"early readers\", \"middle readers\" and \"advanced readers\". Then they wrote their best wishes to patients on bookmarks   and letters, put the books in big boxes and donated them to the hospital.\n\"We wrote things like, \"Keep on reading!' and 'Hope you feel better!,\" said John, 14, Jenny's brother. \"And we also wrote some funny things to make them laugh.\"\nFrank, 12, and Steven, 14, helped carry 16 large boxes of books into a car. \"I think these books will make me a lot of patients feel happy.\" said Frank. Steven shared his opinion. \"It is really the most meaningful thing that I have ever done in my life.\"", "id": "middle279.txt"}
