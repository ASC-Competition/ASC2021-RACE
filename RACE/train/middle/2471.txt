It's good and necessary for a family to learn how to prepare for a fire. Here are some suggestions.\nPut a smoke alarm in the house. Smoke from a fire causes the alarm to go off. The alarm makes a loud sound. The sound tells everyone to leave the house at once.\nMake escape plans. We should know all the ways out of the house. If there is a fire, everyone follows the plan to get out. Part of the plan is to check all the windows to make sure they can be opened easily.\nBuy fire extinguishers  in the house. Everyone in the family should know how to use them.\nPractise for a fire. We do fire practice because we teach children about fire safety. Everyone in the family should know the following fire rules:\nDon't open a hot door! The fire can grow more quickly if you open the door.\nStay close to the floor! Smoke can be more dangerous than fire. The best air is near the floor because smoke rises.\nWhat will you do if your hair or clothes start to burn? First, stop! Don't run! The fire burns faster because of more air. Drop! Fall to the floor. Then roll! Turning over and over will make the fire go out. Put a blanket  around you to keep air away from the fire that may still be on you.\nThere are many possible causes for fires. A wise family is ready all the time. If there is a fire, don't forget to call 119 for help.\n,.", "id": "middle2471.txt"}
