Nearly 50% of students say they are worried about robbery  on the way to and from school. Now in many big cities in China, some schools have taught an unusual lesson: self-protection . Students like this lesson because there are no exams or boring classes. And they can learn how to save lives and know how to stop danger before it really happens.\nChen Haoyu, a teacher at Beijing No.25 Middle School and a self-protection expert , gives young students advice on how to deal with danger.\nIf you are robbed\nKeep calm. If you can not cry for help or run away, give the robber your money. Try to\nremember what the robber looks like and tell the police later.\nIf you are in a traffic accident\nIf a car hurts you, you should remember the car number; if it is a bicycle, try to call your\nparents before you let the rider go. This is because you don't know how badly you are hurt.\nIf it is raining hard and there is lightning \nDon't stay in high places and keep away from trees.\nWhen there is a fire\nGet away as fast as you can. Put wet things on your body and try to find an exit  .\nDo not take the lift!\nIf someone is drowning  \nIf you can't swim, don't get into the water. Cry out for help. Remember that danger is never as far away as you think. Take care of yourself at all times!", "id": "middle308.txt"}
