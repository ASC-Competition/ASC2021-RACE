As a mother, the Chinese-American writer Amy Chua is just a tiger . Her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother (<<>> ), tells us how she gives her two children education.    She says that being strict is the only way to train a child's talent. Her kids had to obey the following rules. To begin with, her kids weren't allowed to watch TV or play computer games. Then, they were not allowed to \" hang out \" with other kids after school. They had to be the top students in their class. And they had to practice the piano and the violin for hours every day. Of course, she believes this has brought a lot of problems for herself and her kids. But she doesn't mind because her kids have become great. Chua says, like her, most Asian mothers are tigers because they believe their children can achieve a lot if they're pushed hard enough. She says American mothers are really cats. They care more about their children's self-respect  . They don't want to be strict with their kids because this may hurt their feelings. With soft words and understanding, they encourage their children to choose for themselves. So is a tiger mom better than a cat mom? It may also depend on the child.", "id": "middle3102.txt"}
