They discuss the main events  of the day. Reporters are then sent to cover the events.\nAs soon as the reporters know what to write about, they get down to work. They telephone people and fix a time for a face-to-face interview with them. Sometimes they do telephone interviews. Checking information is very important. They go to the newspaper's own library to look up any information that they need. This is called \"doing one's homework\".\nAt the same time, the picture editor decides which photographs will be used for the next day's paper. All the people who work on a newspaper must be able to work fast. Reporters have to stop working on one story and start working at once on the important new one. They must find out the new information as quickly as possible. Later in the day, everything is put together at the news desk. Reporters return, type their stories into the computer and hand them to the editor.\nThe chief editor decides which will be the most important story on the front page. Sometimes this will have to be changed if something more important happens late in the day. Other editors read the stories which the reporters have written and make any necessary changes.\nFinally, there is no more time left for adding new stories, and the time for printing  the newspaper has come. This is done on fast-moving printing machines. The newspapers are then delivered  by truck, plane or rail. Speed is important. People want to buy the latest newspaper; nobody wants to buy yesterday's.", "id": "middle505.txt"}
