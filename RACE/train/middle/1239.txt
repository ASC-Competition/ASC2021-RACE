It is easy to get on with some one who is down to earth. A down-to-earth person is the opposite of someone who acts important or proud.\nDown-to-earth people could be important members of society. But they do not consider themselves to be better than others who are less important. A person who is filled with his own importance and pride is said to\" have his nose in the air\".\nAmericans use another expression that is similar in some ways to down to earth. The expression is\" both feet on the ground\". Someone with both feet on the ground is a person with a good understanding of reality. He may have dreams, but he does not allow them to have influence on his understanding of what is real.\nThe opposite kind of person is one who \"has his head in the clouds\". Someone with his head in the clouds is a person whose mind is not on what is happening in real life. Such a person may be called a day-dreamer.\nWhen we have both our feet on the ground, and when we are down to earth, we do not have our noses in the air. We act honestly and openly to others. Our lives are like the ground below us---solid and strong.", "id": "middle1239.txt"}
