Jenny, editor of the school newspaper, said to Andy, who finally agreed to accept the job if Jenny promised not to tell it to anyone else.\nAt first it wasn't too bad. Most of the letters he received were interesting and quite easy to answer. Then came a letter from a person named Joe.\n\"Dear Amy,\" it began, \"I'm in real trouble. I've wanted to be a songwriter all my life, but my parents won't even let me take music lessons. I have a guitar, but they both get angry if I play. I've tried explaining, but they won't listen. I feel sad. Should I run away from home? Maybe that will make my parents agree.\" The letter signed \"Joe\".\nAndy thought about this letter for a long time. Should he advise someone to run away from home?\nOf course not. But didn't Joe have a right to be a songwriter if he wanted to? Andy thought hard, but couldn't think out a good answer. Andy couldn't sleep. He just worried about poor Joe.\nAt a bar a few days later, Eleanor, a girl in Andy's Maths class, sat down next to him and asked,\n\"What's wrong with you? You look a little worried.\"\n\"I guess I do,\" said Andy.\n\"If you got a problem, why don't you try writing to Amy about it?\" asked Eleanor.\nAndy sighed  ; but she continued, \"in fact, I guess Dear Amy is rather busy with other problems. She still hasn't answered the phony letter I wrote her last week. You'd better read it - it may even make the most hard-hearted person cry! It was signed Joe, a songwriter.\"", "id": "middle4127.txt"}
