Instead of turning off the engine   and taking the key with him, the driver left the bus running. And he forgot to set the brake   because he was in a hurry. \"It was cold outside, and I didn't want the kids to get cold while I was using the bathroom,\" he told a police officer.\nThe bus slowly started moving away from the gas station. As the bus picked up speed, the kids began shouting and crying. Ten-year-old Jake ran forward to the driver's seat and held the steering wheel  . He pressed hard on the brake pedal   and managed to stop the bus as it came nearer to a river bed. Jake turned off the engine at last. After the police arrived at the scene, they praised Jake for his great effort.\n\"That is one cool kid,\" said the police officer. \"I told him he would make a great police officer when he grew up.\"\nJake wasn't impressed with what he had done. \"Stopping the bus,\" he said, \"was easy compared to playing Grand Theft Auto III,\" his favorite action video game. The bus driver was taken to the police station. He was at first charged   with \"leaving a child alone while motor is running.\" The lawyer said he hoped to _ the charge because of the number of children (twenty) on the bus.\n\"Whatever he is charged with,\" the police officer said, \"I will see that he never drives a bus again.\"", "id": "middle1792.txt"}
