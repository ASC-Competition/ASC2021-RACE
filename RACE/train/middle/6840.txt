But Venice is such a city .\nVenice is in the northeast of Italy. It wasn't built on land, like Beijing or Shanghai, but on more than 110 islands. Seawater is everywhere around the city.\nEven so, travel isn't that difficult. The waterways have always been the best way to get around. There are 117 waterways and more than 400 bridges that can guide you where you want to go. People in Venice move from place to place by boat.\nWater makes the city special, but it is also a big problem. Sometimes tourists will have such strange experiences . One moment they walk across the Rialto Bridge , and there's nothing special . But when they come back to the bridge an hour later , it's underwater and everyone is wearing rain shoes .\nOnce, people used too much underground water. This made the city get lower little by little. Now the city has gone down by 23 centimeters. Another problem is the rising seawater. The temperature has risen over the years. This has made ice of the Arctic Ocean   melt  . Every year, high waters hit the city in autumn and winter. When a lot of water comes, more than half of the city is underwater.\nScientists are trying different ways to stop the city from getting even lower. The Italian government has asked some of Italy's biggest companies to build the MOST project , which was planned to be built under the seawater to stop the rising water . Anyway , this project is helping solve the problem .", "id": "middle6840.txt"}
