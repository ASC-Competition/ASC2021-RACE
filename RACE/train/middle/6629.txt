Simple passwords are easy to be stolen .\nA password is like a key to your home. If someone steals  it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to  them until we lose or forget one.\nA study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16 percent took a first name as a password. Another 14 percent used the easiest keyboard combinations  such as 12345678 or QWERTY. 5 percent of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3 percent of the passwords expressed feelings like \"I don't care\", \"whatever\", \"I love you\", or their opposite , \"I hate you\".\nRobert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters  with one capital letter  and one symbol .\nOf course, safe passwords don't mean those hard to remember. Forgetting your password is sometimes a big headache for you. Maybe, the best password is easy for you and hard for others.", "id": "middle6629.txt"}
