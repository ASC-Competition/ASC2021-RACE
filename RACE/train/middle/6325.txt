When the family have meals together and there is fish in the meal, her children always give her the fish heads first. Only when she is eating outside, she often says \"no\" to fish heads very politely.\nNot long ago, Mrs. Ai dies. Before she dies, some of her old friends come to see her and cook some fish heads for her. At that time she can't eat anything, but she tells her friends a secret, \"Thank you very much for cooking me the fish heads. But tell you the truth: I never really love eating fish heads. My family is poor. My husband and children like eating fish. If I eat some, they will eat a little less. If I don't eat any, they will feel sorry. So I have to say I love eating fish heads. In my life, I only wish I could eat the meat of the fish.\"\nNow, if someone says he (or she) loves eating fish heads, I always want to know: Does he (or she) really love eating fish heads or just eat fish heads for love?", "id": "middle6325.txt"}
