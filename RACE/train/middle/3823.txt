Everyone needs friends. We all like to feel close to someone. It is nice to have a friend to talk, laugh and do things with. Certainly, sometimes we need to be alone. We don't always want people around. But we would feel lonely if we never had a friend.\nNo two people are just the same. Friends sometimes don't get on well. That doesn't mean that they no longer like each other. Most of the time they will make it up and become friends again.\nSometimes friends move away. Then we feel very sad. We miss them very much but we can call them or write to them. We can also make new friends. It is encouraging to find out how much we like new people when we get to know them.\nThere's more good news for people who have friends. They live longer than people who don't. Why? Friends can make us feel happy. Being happy helps you stay well. If someone cares about you, you will take better care of yourself.", "id": "middle3823.txt"}
