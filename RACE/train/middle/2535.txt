She was feeling a little tired, as she was carrying her shopping bags. They were so heavy that she decided to have a rest in the park. She walked towards the gate of the park. She noticed a poor man walking out of a restaurant in front of her. The man was holding a paper bag. He walked to a rubbish bin  and started looking through it.\nSusan suddenly felt sad. She knew this man would take all that he could get, so she went up to him and gave him some fruit. The man looked up in surprise and took what she gave him.\nA big smile appeared on his face and she felt very happy. Then he said, \"Wow! First someone gave me this sandwich, then the orange juice and now some delicious fruit. This is my daughter's lucky day. Thank you, girl.\" Then he went away, singing a song.\nJust then, Susan understood what the saying \"Giving is getting\" really meant. Everyone in the world needs help, everyone can offer help and everyone will be helped by showing kindness.\nGiving sometimes doesn't cost much, but it means a lot to the people who you help. The man's happiness at that moment comes into Susan's mind every time she has the chance to help others.", "id": "middle2535.txt"}
