They have set up places for them to live safely. No one can kill them for their pretty fur . When a koala is born, he has no fur. And he is not as big as your little toe ! The mother koala has a pocket in the front of her body. The baby goes into this warm pocket. There he stays for six months. The koala could not live without a special kind of tree. The tree gives him both his home and his food. For most of the day the koala sleeps in the tree. At night the koala looks for food. He may go miles to find it. He likes only the _ and the leaves of the tree. He eats nothing else. And he eats more than two pounds each night!How lovely the koalas really are!", "id": "middle1913.txt"}
