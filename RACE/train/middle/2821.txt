School education is very important and useful, yet no one can learn everything from school. No matter how much a teacher knows, he can't teach his students everything they want to know. His work is to show his students how to learn.He teaches them how to read and how to think. So, much more is to be learned outside school by the students themselves.\nIt is always more important to know how to study by oneself. It is quite easy to learn something in language or formula ( )in maths, but it is difficult to use a formula to find the answer to a maths problem. Great inventors do not get everything from school, but they can invent many things and change the world a lot. Though Thomas Edison invented many things, he didn't have much school education.

They work hard all their lives, and the most important thing is that they know how to use their heads.", "id": "middle2821.txt"}
