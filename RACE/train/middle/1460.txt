The HR manager interviewed him and then watched him cleaning the floor as a test. \"You have passed the test,\" he said. \"Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the form to fill in and the date when you may start.\" The man replied, \"But I don't have a computer, neither an e-mail.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said the HR manager. \"If you don't have an e-mail, that means you are not living. And anyone who isn't living cannot have the job.\"\nThe man left with no hope at all. He didn't know what to do with only $10 in his pocket. He thought and thought. Then he went to the supermarket and bought 10 kilos of tomatoes. He sold the tomatoes from door to door. In less than two hours, he had 20 dollars. He repeated the operation three times, and started to go early every day, and returned home late. Shortly, he bought a cart , then a truck, then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles . Five years later, the man was one of the biggest food retailers    in the US.\nOne day, one of his friends asked him for his e-mail. He said, \"I haven't got one.\" His friend couldn't believe his ears. \"Can you imagine what you could have been if you had an e-mail?\" The man thought for a while and replied, \"Yes, I'd be an office boy at Microsoft!\"\n,.", "id": "middle1460.txt"}
