They call this sickness Internet Addiction Disorder  (IAD).\nPeople with IAD are online a lot. They spend hours chatting to their friends or playing online games. Many people with IAD spend more time on the Internet than with family or friends. Some people with IAD even quit their jobs!\nDo you have IAD? Think about these questions:How many hours a day are you online? Is it a lot or a little? When you are not online,are you thinking about playing a computer game or checking your messages? When you are online,do you forget the time? Do you get angry when you can't play a game?\nIf you have IAD,what can you do? Dr. Ivan Goldberg and Dr. Kimberly S.Young have some ideas. First,ask yourself \"Why am I online a lot?\" Then try to take a break. For example,use the computer or play games twice a week,not every day. In this way,you can have a good social life with other friends.", "id": "middle4017.txt"}
