The word _ was from the Greek word, graphein, which only meant writing. These days, however, the word means drawing or writing on the walls of buildings, or the public transportation, such as trains or buses.\nGraffiti, as a form of expression, was born in New York during the 1960s and 1970s. At that time, a new modern culture about city life appeared. Graffiti was a written form of expression of that life. Later, it was mixed with a musical form called hip-hop that was another expression of the city life.\nAt first, graffiti artists used pens. But then, with the development of graffiti, they became experienced. They turned to using spray paint  . Spray paint allowed them to draw a greater area. And it also allowed them to work quickly.\nAt present, different people have different ideas about graffiti. Some people say it makes the cities dirty. It isn't allowed by many local governments in America. The governments spend more than a million dollars a year cleaning graffiti. The money, they say, could be better spent on health or education. Other people think it is a form of art. In fact, the works of some famous graffiti artists can be found in museums, galleries, and art books.", "id": "middle3038.txt"}
