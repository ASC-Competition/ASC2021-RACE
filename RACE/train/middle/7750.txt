Each one put out his hand and _ it. The first man thought it was a tree ---it was tall and round. The second man felt something tall and wide and rough  and said, \"Aha! This must be a wall !\" The third man touched a very long smooth thing. He guessed this was a spear  .Then the fourth man said, \"I feel cool. There must be a fan up there. Oh, yes! Here it is!\" He touched something big and round that was moving. What did the fifth man find? Well, he started shouting that he was being chased  by a snake.\nEach man was sure he knew what he had touched, but they were wrong. They finally understood the mystery when the big thing attempted  to move, and they felt silly because everything they had touched belonged to an elephant.", "id": "middle7750.txt"}
