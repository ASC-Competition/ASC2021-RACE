There is an old saying \"Friends are God's way of taking care of us.\" But how do you find real friendship and keep it?\nThe American writer Sally Seamans tells young students some smart ways to find friends. Sally says finding friendship is just like planting a tree. You plant the seed   and take care of it to make it grow.\nFirst, you should choose a friend. What good friends should you make? It's not because a person has money or good looks. A good friend should be kind and _ For example, if you have a bad day, a good friend should listen to your complains and do his or her best to help.
