Try laughing for no reason at all. That's how thousands of people start their day at Laughter Clubs around the world.\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995, by Dr Madan Kataria. \"Children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\" says Dr Kataria. \"Everyone's naturally good at laughing -- it's the universal   language.\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 worldwide.\nMany doctors are also interested in the effects of laughter on our health. According to a 5-year study at the UCLS School of Medicine in California, with laughing there is less stress in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\nSo what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to the nearest club in the south of London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class. I had no interest in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid  . Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands   and say \"ho ho ho, ha ha ha\" while looking at each other. Although we couldn't tell the differences between _ laughter and real laughter, they still produced the same healthy effects.\nSurprisingly, it worked! After ten minutes, everybody there was laughing for real and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was shocked by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing.", "id": "middle3192.txt"}
