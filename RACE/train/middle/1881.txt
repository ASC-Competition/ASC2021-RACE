Where is it? How bright is it? What lies above it? These questions are difficult to answer, aren't they?\nIs the sky blue? The sky has no color. We know that there is air around the world. When planes fly, they need air to lift their wings. Planes can't fly very high because the air gets thinner when they go up higher. If we go up about 1,200 kilometers from the earth, we'll find no air there.\nWhen we talk about the sky, we usually mean the atmosphere around the earth. It is like a very thick \"cover\" over the earth and keeps it warm. Without the \"cover\", the earth would be a very cold place and nothing could live on it.\nLooking up above us, you will see the blue sky with white clouds. It is usually light blue, but the sky would be dark blue if you go to the top of the highest mountains. And you will see fewer clouds between you and the sun.\nAnd if you sit in a spaceship high above the earth, there is no air at all. The sky would be so dark that its color would be black.\nSometimes the sky doesn't look blue. When the sun rises and falls, you will see red, orange, and other colors in the sky. These are the most beautiful moments of the day.\nNow you may understand that we see colors because the air scatters   the sunlight. Light travels through the air. Without air, there would be no light and no colors.", "id": "middle1881.txt"}
