If so, please remember, for often, achieving what you expect is not the most important thing. Here is a story to tell you why.\nOne day a little boy decided to dig a hole behind his house after watching a science program. As he was working, a couple of boys stopped by to watch. \"What are you doing?\" asked one of the visitors. \"I want to dig a deep hole all the way through the earth!\" the boy answered excitedly. The older boys began to laugh, telling him that it was impossible to do it. Then they left.\nThe little boy kept on digging and digging. Suddenly, a few small colorful stones caught his eyes. He collected them and put them into a glass jar   patiently. Humming   a song, he went on digging. The jar was full soon. Then he talked to himself calmly and proudly, \"Maybe I can't finish digging all the way through the earth, but look at what I have found in the process   of digging!\"\nThe boy's goal   was too difficult, but it did cause him to go on, in other words, to cause us to keep working!\nNot every goal will be achieved. Not every job will end up with a success. Not every dream will come true. But when you can't achieve your goal, maybe you can say, \"Yes, but look what I've found along the way! There are so many wonderful things that have come into my life because I tried to do something!\" _ It is the unexpected joy on the journey that really has a meaning.", "id": "middle4892.txt"}
