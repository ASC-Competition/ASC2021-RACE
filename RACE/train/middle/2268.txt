Some are just hard to figure out and others don't make any sense at all. Here are four funny English sayings that you can use every day.\nI'm happy as a clam .\nThink of a clam. It doesn't have to do anything. It just sits on a beach or on the bottom of the ocean all day doing nothing. It never has to work. That sounds like happiness, doesn't it? If someone asks, \"How are you today?\" you can answer \"I am happy as a clam\" to let him or her know what a great mood you are in.\nI wouldn't touch that (or him/her) with a ten-foot pole.\nMaybe there is a person who you don't want to be friends with or even talk to. Well, this saying means that you dislike him or her so much that you don't want to touch or go near him or her, even within ten feet!\nYou don't have a leg to stand on.\nThis saying doesn't mean that the person you're talking to has no legs. It means that his or her argument is incorrect. He or she doesn't have a leg to stand on because he or she has no facts to support what he or she is saying. This saying is a good way to tell people that you think they're wrong.\nBreak a leg!\nThis saying actually means the opposite of what it sounds like. If you tell this to a person, you're wishing him or her good luck!The saying comes from a superstition  that whatever you say aloud, the opposite will come true.", "id": "middle2268.txt"}
