My head was full of problems and confusion . I decided to take a walk even though I didn't know where to go. The most special thing happened when I was out for this walk.\nI saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least 70 years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me.\nThen, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, \"Grandfather, may I polish   your shoes?\" That old man took pity on her, smiled and gave her a shoe to polish.\nThe girl told him she needed money to buy her brother a new school uniform.\n\"Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a uniform.\" Then they walked to a market , and he bought her brother a uniform.\nThe girl said \"thanks\" to him and left, leaving the old man smiling.\nHe walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, \"You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!\"  As I walked away, I looked back and I could see him still smiling.\nI was blown away by the kindness I had just seen.  Someone who had so little was so generous! Amazing! My own sadness had completely disappeared, chased way by the light of this kind act.\nI began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation   of what I have by following the example of the old man. He only had a little, but shared it so beautifully with someone who had nothing.", "id": "middle3017.txt"}
