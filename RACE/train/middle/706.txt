When it was about six o'clock, my wife found that we had little bread. So she asked our five-year-old daughter, Kathy, to buy some.\n'Here's a dollar,' my wife said, 'get two loaves of bread, if they have it. If they don't have it, get anything. But hurry!'\nKathy hurried off, and we waited and waited. By a quarter past six, all the friends had arrived. But Kathy had not returned. Finally we saw her dancing around the corner with a bright new hula hoop  whirling  round her middle.\n\"Kathy!\" her mother cried. \"Where did you get that hula hoop, and where is the bread?\"\n\"Well, when I got to the shop, they had sold out all their bread,\" answered Kathy. \"And you said 'If they don't have that, get anything!'\"", "id": "middle706.txt"}
