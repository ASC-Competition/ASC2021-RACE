He held up a glass of water and asked the class, \"How heavy do you think this glass of water is?\"\nThe students' answers ranged from 20 g to 500 g. \"It does not matter on the weight itself. It depends on how long you hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it is OK. If I hold it for an hour, I will have an ache in my right arm. If I hold it for a day, you will have to call an ambulance  . It is exactly the same weight, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes. \"\nIf we carry our burdens   all the time, sooner or later, we will not be able to carry on, the burden becoming increasingly heavier. \"\n\"What you have to do is to put the glass down, rest for a while before holding it up again. \"\nWe have to put down the burden sometimes, so that we can be refreshed and are able to carry on.\nSo before you return home from work tonight, put the burden of work down. Don't carry it back home. You can pick it up tomorrow.\nWhatever burdens you are having now on your shoulders, let it down for a moment if you can.", "id": "middle1087.txt"}
