I take some exercise and then have a light breakfast. Then I drive to my office. It takes me thirty minutes, so I usually get there earlier than others.\nI am very busy. I think every minute counts, so I plan my work very carefully. I keep a diary to help me remember things. I meet and talk with many people. I make lots of telephone calls. I often go out and visit many people. I come back home at seven. I often watch TV at supper time. Then I begin to write down what I know. I like being busy.", "id": "middle95.txt"}
