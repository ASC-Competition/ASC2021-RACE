How are you?\"\nHe studied me from head to toe,and asked,\"Are you a little mommy?\"\n\"Yes,I have a son,\" I answered.\n\"Why are you so little?\"he asked.\n\"It's the way I was born,\" I said.\"Some people are little. Some are tall. I'm just not going to grow any bigger.\"After I answered his other questions,I shook the boy's hand and left.\nMy life as a little person is filled with stories like that. I enjoy talking to children and explaining why I look different from their parents.\nIt takes only one glance( ) to see I'm different. I stand three feet nine inches tall(=\"1.14\" metres).I was born adwarf.In spite of this,I did all the things other kids did when I was growing up.\nI didn't realize how short I was until I started school. Some kids called me names  .Then I knew. I began to hate the first day of school each year.\nBut I learned to smile and face the fact that I was going to be noticed my whole life.What I lacked in height,I made up for in personality.When people are rude,I remind myself,\"Look what else I have-a great family,nice friends.\"", "id": "middle366.txt"}
