He said that something terrible would happen if he did. Santi didn't really believe this. While Len was out of the room, Santi jumped down on the sofa with the remote control in his hand. For a while, he changed from channel to channel, looking for something interesting to watch. Bored, Santi decided to see what Len could have meant.\nWith a quick glance  over his shoulder to make sure Len hadn't come back,he pushed all the buttons at once. Santi saw a bright flash,and he dropped the remote control. \"I've broken it,\"he thought. \"Now I'm in trouble!\" As he looked around for the remote control,he realized he was in more trouble than he'd thought. He was suddenly only the size of a mouse.\n\"Oh,no!\"Santi shouted. He had to find his parents quickly. Carefully, he climbed down the side of the huge sofa and hurried across the floor. In the kitchen, Santi could see that the sliding door  had been left open. \"If the door is open, then the cat might be in here,\" tiny Santi said.\nJust then, Santi and the cat saw each other. Santi ran for the door, the cat closing in quickly behind him. Just as the cat reached out to attack Santi, it slipped  on some water and slid across the kitchen floor. Out of breath, Santi hid behind a flowerpot in the corridor. He could see his mum far away in the garden. \"How will I ever get there?\" he wondered. As he looked out from behind the flowerpot, there was the huge cat looking right at him! Santi rushed for the garden and then..., he woke up. \"It was only a dream!\" he said with a relieved smile. \"Thank goodness!\"", "id": "middle717.txt"}
