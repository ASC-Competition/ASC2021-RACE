But, before 1750, the idea of skating didn't exist . That changed because of a man named Joseph Merlin. Merlin's work was making musical instruments.\nOne day Merlin was invited to a music party. He was very pleased and a little excited. As the day of the party came near, Merlin began to think how to make a grand entrance   at the party. He had an idea. He thought he would get a lot of attention if he could skate into the room.\nMerlin tried different ways to make himself roll. Finally, he decided to put two wheels under each shoe. These were the first roller skates in the world. Merlin was very proud of his invention and dreamed of getting to the party on wheels while playing the violin.\nOn the night of the party Merlin rolled into the room playing his violin. Everyone was surprised to see him. There was just one problem. Merlin had no way to stop his roller skates. He rolled on and on, suddenly, he ran into a huge mirror that was hanging on the wall. Down fell the mirror, breaking into pieces. Nobody forgot Merlin's entrance!", "id": "middle6327.txt"}
