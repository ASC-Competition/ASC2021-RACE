They got on well with each other. But one day, Rose didn't see her school IC card at lunch time. She asked her classmates and looked for it everywhere. But she couldn't find it. Later, one girl said that she saw Kate take a card from Rose's desk. Hearing this, Rose got very angry.\nWhen she met Kate in the afternoon, Rose shouted, \"You have stolen my card!\" Hearing this, Kate began to cry, \"No, no, I didn't steal it! I only took it by mistake.\" But Rose didn't think so and she began to say bad words to Kate.\nJust then a teacher came up and asked what had happened. Kate told the whole story. She said a middle school classmate of hers came to see her in the morning. She was so excited that she took the card on the desk and rushed out. Then they went for lunch happily. \"I used the card, but I had thought it was mine. I didn't know it was Rose's until she looked for it. I was too afraid to explain it to her. So I decided to put the card back with some money secretly. I am sorry, Rose.\" Kate said in a low voice.\n\"It's just a misunderstanding  !\" said the teacher. Tears came into Rose's eyes. Then she said, \"I was very sorry, Kate! I hope we are still good friends.\" Kate smiled when she heard the words. Hand in hand, they walked toward the classroom building.", "id": "middle2853.txt"}
