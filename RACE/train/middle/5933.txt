Two silver coins were shining in a melting  snow bank, so I dug  through the snow looking for more. Of course, I just ended up with really cold hands. I slipped the two coins into my pocket and went home, colder but richer. I began to think about how to spend the money...\nTwo days later, Mary and her little sister were searching the snow banks. \"Finders are keepers\" was my first thought. I didn't want to hand them out even though Susy was already crying. \" I dropped them right here,\" she said between tears. Her hands were cold and red for digging in the snow. Maybe they slid down the street with the melting snow. Let's dig over here.\" Mary's voice sounded confident.\n\"They'll never know\" was my second thought, and I walked past them. \" Phil, have you seen\ntwo sliver coins?\" asked Mary. Susy looked up from digging. _ .\n\"Tell a lie\" was my third thought. \"As a matter of fact,\" I hesitated ,\"I dug two coins out of that snow bank just a few days ago.
