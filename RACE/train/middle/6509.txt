It means breakfast should be the most important meal of your day. Why?\nThe answer is in the word breakfast itself. Breakfast means \"breaking of the fast \". There are about twelve hours between dinner and breakfast, so it's important to eat breakfast to keep in good health.

For most Japanese and Australians, the evening meal is the main meal of the day, too.\nIn Mexico, the main meal for many families is usually at 2:00 pm.
