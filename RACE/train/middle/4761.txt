They visited many places of interest and had a good time here. Before they left for New York, the Clarkes climbed the Great Wall. It was the greatest project over two thousand years ago. They took a lot of photos there and then they had a picnic under a big tree. Suddenly it began to rain and they hurried to the car. And when they returned to the hotel, they couldn't find the bag in which their expensive camera was. They were all sorry for it. They could buy another camera but had no time to go to the Great Wall again. They could not miss the plane!\nThat evening they didn't have supper. Mr. Clarke hoped to make them happy, so he said, \"Well, let me tell you a story. An old man lived in a sixty-storey building. One day he fell down from it when he was cleaning the window. But he didn't hurt himself.\"\n\"It was a miracle!\" called out his children, \"Why?\"\n\"Because he lived on the first floor!\"\nThey all began to laugh while two policemen with a bag came in. They said a Chinese boy found it under a big tree and he asked them to find out who lost it.\n\"It's really a miracle!\" the Clarkes said happily.", "id": "middle4761.txt"}
