But there is a new mobile game that may change your opinion about it, and you might even learn something while you play it-Meet Sortee.\nMeet Sortee is a puzzle game developed by Flow Studio, a UK company. It makes you think deeply about everyday objects and their meanings.\nThe rule of the game is quite simple. Two bins are placed on either side of the screen. Each of the bins has a label   next to it and the label explains what it is for. When an object, such as a car or an apple, appears on the screen, you need to decide which bin it should be sorted into and then send it there by moving your finger.\nThe game seems easy enough at first. But as you move on to more levels, it gets harder. The number of bins increases to three or four and the time given gets shorter. You need to think and move faster. That can be really difficult.\nThere are 400 0bjects in total and more than 100 bins in the game.  The more objects you correctly sort, the more game coins you can get It's a bit like working in a rubbish recycling center,  but it has no bad smell.\nYou can download the free game from Apple's app store  ,  but it only lets you play the first few levels. If you want to open the next 40 levels, you need to pay 6 yuan for the full game.", "id": "middle7782.txt"}
