They are nice children, and Miss Williams like them all, but they often lose  some of the clothes. It's winter, and the weather is very cold. The children's mothers always take them to school with warm coats and hats and gloves . The children come into the classroom in the morning and take off their coats and hats and gloves, and put the gloves in the pockets of their coats.\nLast Tuesday, Miss Williams found two small blue gloves on the floor in the evening, and the next morning, she asked the children, \"Whose gloves are these?\" But no one answered. \"Haven't you got blue gloves, Dick?\" she asked him.\n\"Yes, Miss Williams,\" he answered, \"but those can't be mine.
