It took me hours to get there and I drove round and round looking for a place to park my car.  At last I found a place in a back street.  As I was already half an hour late, I parked my car quickly and hurried off on foot. Making my way rapidly along the street, I could not help thinking that it was much easier to walk than to drive.\nAt noon, I left my friend's office.  It suddenly stuck me that I had no idea where I had parked my car.  Walking down street after street, I examined each car closely and was greatly relaxed to see a small green car just behind an old truck. But how _ I was to discover that though the car was very much like my own, it belonged  to someone else. Quite tired now, I was ready to give up the search when I turned the corner.  I nearly jumped with joy: my car was just in front of me !", "id": "middle4712.txt"}
