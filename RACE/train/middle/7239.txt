Recently there has been a report about a woman from Australia who can remember almost every detail   of all the events in her daily life.\nRebecca Sharrock, 25, is one of just 80 people worldwide who have been identified  as having Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory ( HSAM,). It means she can remember every small event-which most people would forget with in (......)  days-as if it had happened just minutes ago.\n\"I remember my mum putting me in the driver's seat of a car and taking a picture of me when I was 12 days old,\" she said. \"That's my earliest memory. I remember every day since then. I can't tell all the dates exactly because I was too young to understand calendars, but I remember what I did that every day, what the weather was like and so on.\"\nRebecca can also re-experience taste. If she's eating something that she doesn't like, she thinks about Black Forest cake, her favorite food, and the memory will be so strong that she can nearly \"taste\" it.\nHowever,  sometimes her memories prove   to be painful. Because they're not just events that she remembers. \"When I relive   memories, the feelings return, too,\" Rebecca said. \"For example, I remember falling over when I was three at my grandparents' house and hurting my left knee. Talking about it now, I feel painful in my left knee. \"\n\"At night, I have to sleep with the radio/recorder and a soft light on, she added. \"1f it's too dark or quiet, my mind would be filled with all these memories and I can't sleep. \"", "id": "middle7239.txt"}
