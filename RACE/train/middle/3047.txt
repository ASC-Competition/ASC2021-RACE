He began to study in a middle school two years ago. His home is in a small village and it's nearly five kilometers from the school. He has to get up early in the morning. After a quick breakfast, he has to run to school and get there on time. His father hopes to borrow some money to buy a bike for him, but he knows his mother is always ill and his father spends much money on medicine. He doesn't agree with him and keeps running there every day. Now he's very strong and never late for class and his teachers often praise him.\nLast week there was a sports meeting in his school. John ran faster than any other boy and won the boys' 800 meters, 1,500 meters and 3,000 meters. The whole school knew him. He was very happy. He told his grandma about the good news as soon as he got home.\n\"I broke two school records today, Granny.\" called out the boy.\nTo his surprise, the old woman wasn't happy. She thought for a while and said, \"I'm sorry to hear that. We have no money to pay for them, you know!\"", "id": "middle3047.txt"}
