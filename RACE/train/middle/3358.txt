Ann Moore introduced the idea of a baby carrier to American people nearly 50 years ago.\nAnn spent two years in Africa in the early 1960s. She worked as a nurse there. Ann saw babies wrapped in bright cloth tied to their mothers' backs. The babies snuggled   close to their mothers, and the mothers could use their hands to do other things.\nIn 1964, Ann had her own baby. She tried making a carrier like the one African mothers used. The carrier was like a backpack. Everywhere Ann went with her baby in the carrier, people asked, \"Where can I buy one?\" In 1965, Ann and her mother began to sell handmade carriers. Ann received a patent   for the baby carrier in 1969. By that time, the baby carrier had leg holes and straps   that could be made longer or shorter. It could also be worn on the back or front.\nBy 1979, the baby carriers were made in a factory. These baby carriers cost less to make and more than 25,000 were sold every month.\nWhen Ann made her first baby carrier, she just wanted to keep her baby close and still have her hands free to do other things. Now all over the world babies ride in baby carriers, close to their parents, safe and happy.\n,.", "id": "middle3358.txt"}
