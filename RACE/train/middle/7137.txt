If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language.

David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again.

Erin, age 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun\"", "id": "middle7137.txt"}
