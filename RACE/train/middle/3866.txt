One evening there was a big dance at the hospital. Most of the doctors and nurses would be there, but of course somebody had to be left to look after the sick children, and Joan was not of the lucky ones. She liked dancing very much, so when she had to start work that evening while her friends were getting ready to go to the dance, she felt very sorry for herself.\nShe went to each sick child one after another and said good-night, until she came to one little boy, Dick. Dick was only eleven years old, but he had a very serious illness and couldn't move most parts of his body except his hands. Joan knew Dick would never get any better, but the little boy was always happy and always thinking about other people instead of himself.\nDick knew that Joan loved dancing. So when she came to say good-night to him, he greeted her with the words, \"I'm very sorry that you can't go to the dance because of us. But we are going to have a party for you. If you look in my drawer, you'll find a piece of cake that I _ from my supper today. And there is also a dollar there. You can buy something to drink with the cake. And I'll get up and dance with you myself if I was able to.\"\nSuddenly the hospital dance seemed very far away and not important at all to Joan.\n,.", "id": "middle3866.txt"}
