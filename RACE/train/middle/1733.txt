When he got there, he saw a lot of fruit, but much of it was expensive because they couldn't grow much because there was little water. Finally he saw a big basket of some very red and long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop.\nSo he went up and asked, \"How much each kilo?\"and the shop keeper said, \"Two rupees . \"Two rupees in India was nothing. So he bought a whole kilogram of the fruit and started eating it. But after he ate some of it:oh, my god!His eyes watered, his mouth watered and burnt, and his face became red. He jumped up and down, saying, \"Ah!Ah!Ah!\"\nBut he still continued to eat the fruit!Some people who were looking at him shook their heads and said, \"You're crazy, man. Those are chilies !You can't eat so many!People use them as a _ , but only a little bit to put into food for taste. You can't just eat them like that. \"But the silly man said, \"No, I can't stop!I paid money for them, and now I'll eat them up. It's my money!\"\nAnd you think that man was silly, right?We sometimes do a lot of things like that. We spend money, time or effort doing something. And even though it's been a long time, hard experience tells us it won't work, and we know there's no more hope, we still continue just because we've put money, time, effort and love in to it. Just like the man who ate the chilies and felt so bad but couldn't stop because he didn't want to waste the money he'd paid.\nSo even if you've lost something, let it go and move on. That's better than continuing to lose.", "id": "middle1733.txt"}
