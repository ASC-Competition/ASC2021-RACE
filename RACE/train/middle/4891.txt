I was born and raised there and now I visit it from time to time. My family moved to the city, so I only go back to see friends or to camp and fish.\nI grew up in a small town called Antonito Co. It is surrounded by mountains. So camping is a big source of happiness in the valley. There are so many beautiful places to hike.\nThe town itself is very small. It is said that if you blink   when you're going through it, you'll miss it. This has some truth in it considering the size of the town. We have one grocery store  , a tiny post office , and a tiny bank. There are also a few gas stations, bars, some excellent restaurants, a small hospital and of course several schools. However, for clothing and shoes, you have to drive thirty miles to Alamosa to shop there.\nEveryone in the town is nice and we all know each other. The crime rate   is zero unless you count some weekend fights that break out because some people drink too much. The classes in school are small, so you get a lot of attention from the teacher.\nYou're probably wondering why I don't live there. Well, I can't get a job there. A lot of the businesses are family-owned. And they never fire  their employees. So the employees work there usually until they retire . Most people have to go to other places to get a job.", "id": "middle4891.txt"}
