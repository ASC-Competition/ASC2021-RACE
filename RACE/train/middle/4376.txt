Don't listen to people who say that young people today often think only of themselves. It is not true at all. More and more young people in the United States volunteer(,) to spend  their school  holidays  working for others. And they don't do it for money. Here are some of their stories.\nAlice Hamiton, 17\nI'm going to help the Forest Centre build new hiking paths   in the mountains. It sounds terrible. I'll spend the whole summer living in a tent  and breathing the clean mountain air. I'm going to sleep under the stars. It will be nice, and I'll be able to do something good at the same time!\nJason Moore 18\nThis summer, I'm going to volunteer with Special House Program.They build good,  low-cost houses and sell them to families that are not very rich. They'll teach me what to do, so I'll help people and also have a chance to learn how to build houses.\nTrish Anderson, 16\nI'm going to teach kids who have trouble in reading. I'll work for a program called Reading For Life. Every day, I'm going to help kids choose and read books that they like. I want to be a teacher, and I love children and reading, so this is going to be a great experience for me.\n,.", "id": "middle4376.txt"}
