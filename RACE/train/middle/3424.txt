If a friend of yours asks you to have lunch with him, you may say something like this, \" I'm afraid it'll have to be somewhere cheap, as I have little money.\" The other person may say, \"OK, I'll meet you at McDonald' s.\"\nThis means that the two agree to go Dutch, that is, each person pays for himself. He may also say, \"Oh, no, I want to take you to lunch at Smith's.\" or \" I want you to try the Chinese dumplings there. They are great.\" This means the person wants to pay for both of you. If you feel friendly towards the person, you can go with him and you needn't pay for the meal. You may just say, \" Thank you. That would be very nice.\"\nAmerican custom about who pays for dates is much the same as in other parts of the world. In the old days, American women wanted men to pay for all the meals. But, today, a university girl or a woman in business world will usually pay for her own.", "id": "middle3424.txt"}
