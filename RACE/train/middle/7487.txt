Mydaughter was so young when my mother died that she doesn't remember her well. I told her allI could remember, like how wonderful my mother was and how much she meant to me.\nOne day, Sally was sad because her grandmother was in heaven   and she couldn't\nsee her. I explained that though her grandmother was dead, now she was still watching over usand could send us something to let us know she was there. She could be anywhere, even ridinginvisibly   on the back of a butterfly  . Just after I said this, a butterflyflew down right by us, and we laughed happily.\nNow many people would say it was just luck that the butterfly flew down at that time. A funnything, however, has happened since then. Every time I go out in any type of weather I seebutterflies. Very often they fly right by my face to get my attention. I always say hi to Mom,send her my love, and thank God for little miracles.\nEveryone is always looking for some big miracles to come out and save them when they are introuble, but they don't notice the little miracles that happen every day right in front of theireyes. I know what they really are, however. For me little miracles are the best kind. So manylittle miracles happen around me all the time that I know _ are not just luck.\n,.", "id": "middle7487.txt"}
