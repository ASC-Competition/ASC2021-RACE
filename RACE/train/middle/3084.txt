In fact, it is not that difficult to learn new words, but to remember them for a lifetime seems not to be so easy.\nTo make it easier, you can try word associations . Try to find a connection between a new word and things or people you know. For example, if your neighbour is an unselfish person who cares about the needs of other people, think about this person every time you see the word, and very soon you'll start actively using it.\nTry to use the words you learn as often as possible. Perhaps you are not sure which situations they should be used in, or whether you pronounce  them correctly, but practice is the best way to understand that. It is not enough to find out the meaning of a word. You should hammer   it into your mind by using it in actual conversations in everyday life.\nAlso, it may be helpful to know the meaning of the word roots, prefixes   and suffixes  , especially if they have a Greek or Latin origin . Even if you meet a long unfamiliar word, it will be easy to know its meaning if you know the general meaning of its parts.  For example, if you see the word \"philanthropy\", it won't be difficult to _ what it means if you know that \"anthropo\" means \"human\" and \"philo\" means \"loving\". Not only can ancient Greek and Latin be helpful, but a number of modern languages as well. So, if you speak French,  Italian, Spanish or Portuguese, guess the meaning of an unfamiliar English word if it sounds like  a word from another language you know.", "id": "middle3084.txt"}
