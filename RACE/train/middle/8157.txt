People rap to express how they feel about their lives and problems.\nRapping in class.\nWould you like to rap in class? Well, actually hip pop music is played in more than 10,000 schools in the USA. Why? There is a new school program called \"Flocabulary\" in which teachers use texts and hip hop CDs to help teach different school subjects. The words of the songs are just what students are studying. This makes learning easy and fun. Students and teachers are excited about the good results it has had on exam marks. Mr. Lee, a teacher in a high school, said, \"I've used hip hop songs in class, and I have never seen my students so crazy about history! You can't imagine how well they remember what I teach! We even try to write our own songs.\"\nWhose idea was Flocabulary?\nBlake Harrison, a high school student, was the first person to come up with the idea of Flocabulary. The word \"Flocabulary\" comes from the word \"flow\" and \"vocabulary\". \"Flow\" is a rap word for \"style\", or the way a rapper says the words of a song. \"Vocabulary\" means the words you have to learn in a language. How did he get the idea? Well, he realized he could remember the words of a hip hop song very easily. So, why not make lessons into songs? Today together with Alex Rappaport, a song writer, Blake produces hip hop songs for math, science and literature  . They are now used in schools with great success.", "id": "middle8157.txt"}
