Sometimes the cars could hardly move for a long time. The terrible traffic is caused by the poor road and China's ability to cope with   so many cars on the road at the same time.\nWith more Chinese people buying cars every day, the problem seems to only get worse. But a design company called Shenzhen Hashi Future Parking Equipment has a possible solution: the super bus.\nThe super bus would carry up to 1,400 people in its passenger compartment  . It would travel on a rail system that would be elevated   above the roads, so cars could drive under it. The bus will run on electricity and solar power, creating far less pollution than that from the cars it would be replacing  .\nBeijing authorities haven't decided whether to create railways for the super bus throughout the city. But they are willing to give it a test drive. Later 2010, the company will test for the first time and in 2011 and 2012, the company will test the super bus with passengers.\nAccording to the government, Beijing is probably to have five million cars on the road by the end of 2010. So it seems to be necessary to start taking the bus instead soon.", "id": "middle1426.txt"}
