The TV was on, and everything was peaceful. Suddenly the light went on and off for a few times and then went out completely. Then the rain started, and everything went black. We found the flashlight and some candles and went to bed.\nWednesday, Jan. 7, 7:30 a.m.\nMy first thought after waking up was that it was pretty cold in my bedroom. Clearly, the power   didn't come back. After I looked out of the window, I felt even sadder: it was still raining heavily. The room was becoming colder and colder. We had no idea when the power would come back, so my wife started a fire in the fireplace.\nThursday, Jan. 8, 12:30 p.m.\nThe snow started. The poor trees now had to carry the heavy snow. The storm seemed to last   and we had nothing to do but stay at home.\nFriday, Jan. 9, 6:00 p.m.\nStill no power. Even though we lit   a few candles, it was still difficult to do anything in their weak light. I was sitting near several candles, but I had trouble reading.\nSaturday, Jan. 10, 1:00 p.m.\nThe storm stopped this morning, and I drove my car to look for an open store. The trees along the roads were broken. I only bought the most necessary things: bread, some fruit, more drinking water and batteries   for the flashlight. On my way home, the power came back and people were very happy.", "id": "middle7828.txt"}
