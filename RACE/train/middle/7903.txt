I didn't pay attention when Kevin rushed up the stairs with the hurt on his face.\nAbout 20 minutes later, as I was walking upstairs I heard Kevin crying inside the bathroom. I knocked on the door and asked, \"Hey Kevin, do you want to talk?\"\nNo answer.\nI tried again, \"Why don't you come out of there?\"\nAgain, no answer.\nSo, joking around, I grabbed a stack of  cards and a pencil and wrote, \"If you don't want to talk, we can write notes to each other.\"\nAn hour later I was still sitting on the floor outside the bathroom with two stacks of cards in front of me. One was blank and one was cards from Kevin on which he had translated all his _ feelings into words for me. As I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes. It said, \"Nobody in this family cares about me. I'm not the youngest, and I'm not the oldest. Tommy thinks I'm silly and Dad wishes he had the other Kevin as a kid because he's better at basketball. And you're never around to even notice me.\"\nTears came to my eyes as I wrote back to him. \"You know Kevin, I really do love you and I'm sorry I don't always show it. I am here for you and you are loved in this family.\"\nThere was no answer for a while, but then I heard a tearing sound coming from inside the bathroom. Kevin, who had run out of cards wrote on a torn paper cup. \"Thanks.\"\nI wrote back \"For what?\" it returned to me with \"Loving me\" on it.\nSince then, I try my best to never only half-notice my family members any more. Kevin and I have a closer relationship now. And sometimes when one of us notices that the other is upset, we'll smile and say \"Write it on a paper cup.\"", "id": "middle7903.txt"}
