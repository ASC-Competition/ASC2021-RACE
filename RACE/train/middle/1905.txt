I have an 8-year-old daughter. Her name is Ann. Her favorite activity is watching movies. She watches movies once a week . Movie World is in my neighborhood . And it is the biggest movie theater in the city . It has the most comfortable seats and the best sound . She likes watching movies there.\nLast Sunday, I took her to Movie World to watch the movie Epic . Epic is a movie about a father Bomba and his 17-year-old daughter Mary. Bomba was interested in looking for Leaf Men. He said they lived in a forest, but no one believed him. One day , Mary was swept into   the world of the Leaf Men, and she found her father was right.\nAt this early-afternoon showing, the theater was almost full. 60% of the _ were kids aged three to ten and their fathers. I didn't think it was because of the movie itself. In fact, a study showed that dads were 50% more likely than moms to take young kids to the movies in the United States.\n,.", "id": "middle1905.txt"}
