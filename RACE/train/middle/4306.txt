He was a wise king and a brave soldier. When the English army invaded    Scotland, Bruce took up arms and led his people in defence of  his country.\nBattle after battle was fought, Bruce led his little army against the enemy, and six times his men were beaten. His army was scattered, and he was forced to go into hiding----in the woods or in lonely places in the mountains. One rainy day, Bruce lay on the ground in a small house, listening to the sound of the rain on the roof .He was tired and sad, and ready to give up all hope. It seemed to him that it was no use trying to do anything more.\nAs he lay thinking, he saw a spider   over his head, trying to spin a web  . He watched as she worked slowly and with great care. Six times she tried to reach the opposite wall to fix her thread, but six times she failed.\"Poor thing,\" cried Bruce, \"You ,too, know what it is to fail.\"But the spider did not lose hope. With still more care, she tried for the seventh time. Bruce almost forgot his own trouble as he watched her swing herself out upon the thin line. Would she fail again? No, the thread was carried safely from one wall to the other.\"I, too, will try a seventh time,\" cried Bruce. He got up and called his men together. He told them his plans, and sent them out with message of cheer to his discouraged people. Soon there was an army of brave Scotsmen gathered around him. Another battle was fought. This time the Scots won and the English invaders were driven out of Scotland.", "id": "middle4306.txt"}
