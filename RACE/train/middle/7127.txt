We hope that your visit here will be pleasant. Today, I would like to draw your attention to a few of our laws.\nThe first one is about drinking. Now you may not buy alcohol  in this country if you are under 18 years old, nor may your friends buy it for you.\nSecondly, noise. Enjoy yourselves by all means, but please don't make unnecessary noise, especially at night. We ask you to respect other people who may wish to be quiet.\nThirdly, crossing the road. Be careful. The traffic moves on the left side of the road in this country. Use the crossing for walking and don't take any chances when crossing the road.\nMy next point is about rubbish. It is an offence  to drop litter in the street. When you have something to throw away, please put it in your pocket and take it home, or put it into a rubbish bin.\nFinally, smoking. It is against the law to buy cigarettes or tobacco  if you are under 16 years old.\nI'd like to finish by saying that if you need any kind of help, you can turn to the police. The police will be pleased to help you. You can call, or directly go to ask any policeman.", "id": "middle7127.txt"}
