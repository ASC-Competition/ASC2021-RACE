When your children do something right, let them know. When your children do something wrong, tell them how they should do it and why.\nHere are some basic manners for children:\n1. Wait for their turn and don't _ other people when they are speaking. Tell them to wait until someone finishes speaking, and then ask questions.\n2. Always greet the people who come over to your house. You can teach your children to shake hands with grown-ups   who come over, but it's not necessary to shake hands with other children. Your children should always say \"hello\" or \"hi\" when someone comes to your home so that the guest   feels welcome.\n3. Say \"please\" and \"Thank you\" often. And say \"You're welcome\" to answer others' \"Thank you\".\n4. After playing a game, no matter what the result is, be pleased. If your children win, tell them not to show off  , but to be kind. If they lose, tell them not to get mad and tell the other children that they did a good job or speak well of them.\nYours\nDr. Dave", "id": "middle4193.txt"}
