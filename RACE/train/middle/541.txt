There was no noise in the forest. We could only hear the birds singing. And then, a bear--a big brown bear--came into the forest.\nThe bear stopped under a tall tree. He was very hungry. He looked up into the tree. There in the nut tree was his supper--a supper of nice nuts. But the nuts were high up in the tree. The hungry bear could not reach them. But he knew how to get his supper. He climbed up the tree.\nUp and up he climbed. He climbed onto a big branch of the tree. He sat there and then shook  the branch again and again. At last the branch broke. The brown bear fell down with the branch and nuts.\nThe bear sat up and looked around. With his big paws he picked up the nuts and ate them up.", "id": "middle541.txt"}
