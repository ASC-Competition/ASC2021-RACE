The autistic   five-year-old girl tried to speak, and she was often thrown into pain by the world around her. She filled her days with painting, and nothing could quite change this situation. Until, that was, a cat called Thula came along.\nThe pair are now inseparable  . Iris' parents believe the gentle cat is helping their little girl communicate with others, as well as influencing her works of art. In the beginning, they thought it was just _ , but now they believe Iris is expressing her love for Thula through her painting. Mother said, \"When Iris is painting, Thula is told by her to \"sit down\" if she jumps up onto the table. She stays there, watching Iris with great interest, sometimes wanting to play with the brushes, but mostly just patiently watching.\"\nAnd the pair's bond   doesn't end there. Thula is at Iris' side for every part of her life. The pair's closeness is having an effect on Iris' relationships with others, and her parents find it easier to encourage her to talk to others. After researching the advantages of animal therapy for autistic children, the couple had tried introducing Iris to horses, dogs and even other cats with no success ---  but things changed when Thula came to live with the family. During weeks, the cat was helping to comfort the little girl in times of stress.\nMother said, \"It was as if they were old friends from the day they met. Thanks to Thula, new doorways to communication and feelings are opening and Iris is happier than ever before.\"[:Zxxk.Com]", "id": "middle7472.txt"}
