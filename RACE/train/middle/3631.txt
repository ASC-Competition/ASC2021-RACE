However, there was no room in my adult life for a dog. Then, last year, I could not stand the fact that I developed cancer  . I wanted to keep a dog, but I knew my illness made it impossible for me to keep one. In early September, to my surprise, my doctor told me that I could keep a pet as my friend, because my immune system   was strong to keep a pet.\nThe same day I went to an animal market with my friends. When I saw a 9-week-old dog with big brown eyes, nice ears and white _ all over the body, I took it home.I'm happy these days since Oscar came into my life.

Thanks to Oscar, my life has changed a lot.", "id": "middle3631.txt"}
