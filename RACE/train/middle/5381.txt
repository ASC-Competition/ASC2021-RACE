Some of it carries bad things, but the main problem with spam is that it is unpleasant because it fills your mail box with pointless messages.\nMost email programs have built-in filters   that will discover unwanted messages and put them into a junk folder  . You can make the filter learn what you consider to be spam or block certain senders.\nAvoid letting your email address appear on websites--spammers search the Internet for email addresses. Be careful who you give your email address to, and if you need to send out several copies of an email, use blind copy instead to cover the other people's addresses.\nDelete   spam emails without opening them. Signs of possible spam are bad spelling in email headers, strange sender addresses, or emails sent at unusual hours. If you do open a spam mail, never reply to it or click on any pictures it may have.\nIf you receive an unexpected email pretending   to come from your bank, credit card company or other suppliers, be very careful. If the email asks you to reply, don't do it! Instead, call up these places or visit their websites.\nConsider setting up a second email address and keep one address for your personal use and another for your online communication.", "id": "middle5381.txt"}
