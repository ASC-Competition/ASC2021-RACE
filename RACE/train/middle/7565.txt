Science fiction writers have written about flying cars for a long time. But now flying cars will soon fly out of the world of science fiction into our real world. And the dream of the science fiction writers will soon come true.\nThe first-known sky car is the FSC-1. The FSC-1 looks like an expensive sports car. You can drive the FSC-1 on the road like a normal car. If you touch a button, its wings and propeller   fold out and then it can take off, fly and land as an airplane. The owners of the FSC-1 can choose if they want to drive or fly.\nAnother flying car or sky car is the Moller Skycar M400. Although you can't drive it on the roads, it is small and easy to fly and can take off and land like a helicopter  . Urban Aeronautics' X-Hawk is another type of sky car. It is expected to be available for about $3 million.\nJust like any new technology, flying cars have taken a long time to be developed. But some experts think the technology is far from what people imagine when they are sitting in traffic. It still needs to be improved.", "id": "middle7565.txt"}
