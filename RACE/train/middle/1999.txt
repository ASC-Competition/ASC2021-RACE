Texting helps to save money. If you have a few words to greet your families and friends on their birthdays or on some important festivals, sending messages can be cheaper than phone calling. Texting helps to save time. Even if you want to send a message to 100 people, you can do it one second. Texting helps you to \"talk\" to someone when he is too busy to answer the phone. Texting can also help you to \"talk\" to someone secretly if you don't want others to hear what you are talking on the phone. These advantages are so amazing that many people are crazy about it. They hold mobile phones in hands all day long, send dozens of messages each day, and even text while driving or walking.\nHowever, texting has its disadvantages. Junk messages may come into your mobile phone box now and then. When your phone box gets too full, you can't receive any more messages. You may therefore miss some important information.\nWhat's more, if you don't do texting properly, for example texting while driving or walking, it can be dangerous. It can cause injuries and even death. It was reported that about 6,000 people were killed and half a million were injured for this reason each year. In Fort Lee, a small town in New Jersey, USA, three people died because they walked into traffic while texting in 2011. Two researchers at Stony Brook University, New York found that texters are 60% more probably to have an accident than others. When people are texting, they don't notice other people or things around them. To reduce traffic accidents, all drivers of the UN are now not allowed to text while driving. About 32 countries have passed laws _ the use of mobile phones while driving.\nTexting is a wonderful way of communication. However, only when we use it properly, can we fully enjoy the fun it brings.", "id": "middle1999.txt"}
