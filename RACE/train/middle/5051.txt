If you like , you take one ; if you don't , the waiters pass you . If you don't give any messages of stopping , they will go on.\nOne day when I was in Brazil , I went to a restaurant to try the roast . After I took my seat, the waiter gave me a sign with the color \"red\" on the side and \"green\" on the other . I said \"thank you\", then the waiters began to serve me .My plate was already full, but the waiters still kept on serving me more. I thought I had to eat more quickly . But to my surprise, the waiters still kept on serving more. Then a waiter found out the reason. He helped me turn the sign over, with red outside . When I finished , I found the waiter didn't take a look at me . Do you know Why? It's just like the traffic lights in the street . How wonderful !", "id": "middle5051.txt"}
