In 1948, they owned a restaurant in California, they liked working in the restaurant, but they got tired of the customers ordering so many different things to eat.\n\"If we gave customers a smaller menu, we could make some of the food before they came, and they wouldn't have to wait so long for their meals,\" said one of the brothers. The other brother agreed and said, \"And if we made the customers come to the counter, we wouldn't need any waiters or waitresses. We could also use plastic plates so there wouldn't be any washing-up.\"\nThese were such good ideas that McDonald brothers used them, and the customers were very pleased. They got their meals very quickly--in less than a minute--and they paid only 15 cents for hamburgers and 10 cents for fries. The first McDonald's restaurant had no seats for customers to sit on. This meant that people had to take their food away, and that no one had to clean up any tables after them.\nThen a man called Ray Kroc came to the brothers and asked to buy their business. They agreed to sell it to him for$27 million. After that, people paid Ray Kroc to open their own restaurants using the McDonald's name and menu. Before long, there were McDonald's restaurants all over the United States, and nowadays, they are all over the world--even in China and Russia. The most successful McDonald's business is in Hong Kong of China. The Hong Kong McDonald's sells more hamburgers every day than any other McDonald's anywhere else in the world.\nMcDonald's restaurants are so successful because children love going to them. They like the food, and they like the toys and games they can get at McDonald's.", "id": "middle479.txt"}
