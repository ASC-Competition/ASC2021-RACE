Luckily, my wife, two friends and I had the chance last year.\nTo see Cuba, you have to talk to the Cubans. Our friends met us at the airport even at 1:00 a.m. which started our trip on a positive note. After a few days at the hotels, we got to know a local tour guide, Victor.\nThe trip started off on a sunny morning. Our return trip would be along the coastline from Havana, but out trip to Havana would be through the countryside and the small towns. This trip was designed for us to visit the Cuban countryside.\nAt first Victor brought us to Revolutionary Square, where Fidel Castro made his yearly speech praising the ideas of the revolution.\nOur second stop was the Bocoy Rum Factory. We walked through and learned how 5000 bottles of rum  are produced every day. The smell of rum, and the huge barrels were interesting.\nThe final stop was the market in Old Havana. Here my wife and I went away from our friends and we toured through this large shopping center. From store to store we saw so many items that all had a clear Cuban feel to them. We bought a picture and some special local things, and then we took off to meet up with Victor.\nAs a tourist I was able to have a quick look at Cuban life with the help of Cubans. I felt lucky to have the chance. It was an interesting experience in my life.", "id": "middle6847.txt"}
