They are wrinkled  or hairless, or they have an angry look on their face. They seem to say, \"Get away! I hate everybody.\" But to a parent, that hairless, wrinkled, angry-faced baby is the most beautiful and perfect child in the world. When that proud father or mother asks you, \"Well, what do you think...isn't she beautiful?\" What are you going to say? Is this the time for the truth? Of course not!\nYou look at that proud father or mother in the eye and say, \"Yes, she is! She is really a beauty. She's one in a million. She's going to be a movie star! I can tell! She's as beautiful as a picture.\"\nIn English, this is a _ lie. White lies don't hurt people. They are not cruel or angry words. People use them to make a difficult thing a little easier. When people don't want to meet someone, or eat something new that they really don't like at a friend's house, they tell a white lie. They are trying to be kind. They feel that being kind is sometimes more important than telling the truth.", "id": "middle5779.txt"}
