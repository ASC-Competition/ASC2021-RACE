Here is something to help you to fit in .\nFirst, take a day to enjoy your school. You won't fit in at school if you don't know the school. Ask for a school map. Try to get to know every corner of your new school. A good school handhook can be of great help. But to make it easy, ask the people near you where something is--tell people that you are new when you need help.\nBe nice to everyone. Be nice to everyone, the young or the old, because they might just be your next teacher or friend.\nGet to know your teachers and pay attention in class. Teachers always pay attention to  new students, Talk to them and find out more about them. Never test their limits --don't go too far, or you may end up getting into trouble \nYou need to make friends. Talk to different people. Be yourself and don't lie. This is YOUR school now, take a chance  on being who you weren't at your old school. Join a few clubs or sports teams and make more friends in this way.\nBe yourself and be polite. Don't worry too much about what people think of you. Be true, be yourself, and be nice to everyone, no matter how mean (unfriendly) they may seem at first. It's often the \"girl/boy that I didn't like at my new school\" that ends up being my friend after a little while. But then again, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself if it's very clear that you should.\nWork hard to fit in while still being yourself. The first few weeks are always hard, but you'll soon get used to it.", "id": "middle4366.txt"}
