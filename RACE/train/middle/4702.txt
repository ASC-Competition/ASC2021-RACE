When the bell rings, students of Luohu Foreign Languages School in Shenzhen quickly take out their cell-phones. They want to log on   to their microblogs   to check the funny things that have happened in the last hour.    Since last year, the trend   of microblogging has swept the country. Recent surveys show that most students in middle schools have a microblog, and some even update  their blogs over five times per day.\n\"We learn many fresh and interesting things on microblogs and they have become popular topics in class,\" said Liang Jianmin, 14, a student at Harbin No 3 Middle School. \"If you do not know about them, you are out of the loop  .\" It is also a great place for students to _ stress. \"My parents always ask me to study hard, and encourage me before exams, but actually it adds pressure  ,\" said Zhang Yazhe, 15, a student in Luohu Foreign Languages School. \"When I share these feelings on my microblog, I get many replies from friends in the same situation, which makes me feel better.\"  But parents are worried that microblogging could be a waste of time. Some misleading  messages may even cause danger to kids, they said.\nShen Mingde, a professor at the China Education Association, suggests parents not worry too much as long as kids are not crazy about microblogging. Instead, it can become a window for parents to understand their children.\n\"If parents can read their children's microblogs, they'll know their thoughts, thus   leading to better communication and solutions to problems,\" he said. Micro blogging tips for kids\n1. Don't microblog for more than one hour a day.\n2. Never microblog in class.\n3. Try to talk face to face with people instead of just microblogging.\n4. Be critical  . Don't trust all the messages on a microblog.", "id": "middle4702.txt"}
