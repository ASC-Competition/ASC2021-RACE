Yet English words do not stay the same. The language is always changing. We need new words for new inventions and new ideas. Different words come into use, or older words are used in a new way.\nEnglish can change by borrowing words from other languages. Tomato was borrowed from Mexico and pajamas from Indian. The word coffee came from Turkey, and tea came from China. Now new space and science words are being borrowed from other countries, too.\nNew words are also made by adding two words together. Strawberry, popcorn, and grandfather are words made up of two parts.\nSometimes new words are shorter forms of older words. The word photo was made from photograph by cutting off the end of the longer word. Plane was made by cutting off the front part of airplane. Smog was made by using only the first two and last two letters from the words smoke and fog.\nThe names of people and products can become new words. Our sandwich was named after a man named Sandwich. Scotch Tape, Band-aid and Jello were names made up by the companies that first made the products.\n,.", "id": "middle4072.txt"}
