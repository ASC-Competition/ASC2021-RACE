What do you like to do in winter? In summer when is rains, we can't go out and play sports outside. We just stay at home, it's very boring. But in winter if it snows we have a lot of things to do. For example, we can make a snowman with our friends. It's not difficult to make a snowman. We just let a snowball roll on the ground until it's big enough. Next we roll another snowball as the head of the snowman. Then put the small snowman on the big snowball. Last try your best to make your snowman beautiful. You can also have snowball fights with your friends. After the snow a lot of people come to the playground. They throw small snowballs to each other. This is a very exciting game in the cold winter.
