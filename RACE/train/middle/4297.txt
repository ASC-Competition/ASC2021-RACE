When Jack saw it coming toward him, he stopped his own car at the side of the road to make room for it to pass. The American car went slowly past, so close that he could see the driver's face quite clearly.\n\"Where have I seen that face before?\" he thought. \"Wait a minute! I remember now.

Yes, it had a large mouth and small ears, and his eyes were behind dark glasses.\n\"Wanted by the police,\" read by Jack. \"The City Bank will give a lot of money to anyone who helps the police to catch this man.\"\n\"Call the police at once\", he said to himself.
