I traveled on the 8:00 a.m. train from Glasgow to London King's Cross and I was quite angry with the service of your company.\nThe train didn't come on time and it was forty minutes late when it left Glasgow. A man at the station said sorry to us, but he didn't give us any reasons for the delay . We then had further delays on the way and had to wait another thirty minutes. As a result, I missed my plane from London to Frankfurt and had to wait for several hours.\nWhat's more, the service on the train was also very poor. The trip took more than five hours. Unluckily. we could buy nothing but some soft drinks on the train. Worst of all, something was wrong with the air conditioning   and it got hotter and hotter in the train. Before we reached King's Cross, the temperature was over 40degC.\nBecause of your poor service. I feel you should pay me compensation .\nI am looking forward to hearing from you.\nYours faithfully,\nDavid Roberson", "id": "middle4504.txt"}
