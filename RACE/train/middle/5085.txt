She had her corneas   donated to two men who needed them, which helped them see the world clearly again.\nYao was born in a music family on Sept. 26, 1981 in Wuhan. She started to learn the piano at the age of 4, and she sang her first song on the stage when she was 9 years old. Yao did quite well in singing, so she took part in the thirteenth Youth Singing Competition and won the first prize.\nShe became well-known to the public after making a series of songs for the hit TV drama \"The Legend of Zhenhuan\" in 2012, and the mandarin version   of \"Let It Go\" from Disney's \"Frozen\". In July 2013, she competed in The Voice of China II and finally got the second place in Na Ying's team. She had won a lot of music awards before she was famous.\nYao Beina was unfortunate to be diagnosed with breast cancer   and had a successful operation in 2011. Since then, she has fought against the disease for about four years while keeping singing, but sadly she failed. She originally thought of donating all of her organs   to save others' lives, but failed to do it because of her serious illness.\nShe's gone, even though she had never stopped struggling with cancer. Heaven just got another beautiful angel, with her beautiful voice and kindness.", "id": "middle5085.txt"}
