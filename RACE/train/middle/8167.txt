I hear some students are going to buy some presents for your teachers. You want to show your love for your teachers. That is very good, of course. But teachers don't like to get presents from students. So please don't buy any! I think on Teachers' Day, a card from you all is enough . And the best present for our teachers is your good work. \"", "id": "middle8167.txt"}
