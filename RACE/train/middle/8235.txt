The third Saturday in December Mark said he had made his list and had twenty dollars in his pocket.\nI drove him to a nearby supermarket. Mark picked up a hand basket and went in while I waited and watched in the car. It took Mark over 45 minutes to choose his presents. Finally he came to the checkout counter   and reached into his pocket ... Mark stood there holding his basket, tears falling down his face.\nThen a surprising thing happened. A woman came up to Mark and took him in her arms. \"You would help me a lot if you let me pay for you,\" said the woman. \"It would be the most wonderful gift you could give me. I only ask one day you will pass it on. When you grow up, I would like you to find someone you can help. When you help others, I know you will feel as good about it as I do now.\"\nMark took the money, dried his tears and ran back to the checkout counter as fast as he could. That year we all enjoyed our gifts almost as much as Mark enjoyed giving them to us.\nI would like to say \"thank you\" to that very kind woman, and tell her that four years later, Mark went house to house collecting blankets and clothes for the homeless people in the fire. And I want to promise her that Mark will never forget to keep passing\non.", "id": "middle8235.txt"}
