Would you like to go with me?\nPeter: Thank you. But I don't want to be tired. I want to sleep at home. Have a good time!\nPaul: I'm sure I will. But now I don't know what to wear.\nPeter: What about your new trousers?\nPaul:My new trousers are made of wool. I don't think they can make me comfortable.\nPeter: You're right. Wool clothes are not fit for a trip. How about your blue jeans? What are they made of?\nPaul: Cotton. They are good for trips. And shall I wear my leather shoes?\nPeter: No. They will make your feet hot. You know, it is hot these days. And they are also too heavy for a trip. Try your trainers.\nPaul: OK. And trainers go well with my jeans.\nPeter: And why not wear your cap? It looks cool on you.\nPaul: Thank you. I will wear it.", "id": "middle8075.txt"}
