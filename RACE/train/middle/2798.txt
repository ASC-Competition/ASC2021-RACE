A bridge is the best way. In some places, there are no bridges. People use the ferry . A ferry is a boat that takes people and cars across the river.\nBoth ends of a ferry look the same. The ferry never has to turn around. It docks at one side of the river. People and cars get on. At the other side, the ferry docks again. The people and cars get off. Other cars and people get on. And then the ferry goes back across the river.\nIn many places, bridges are now taking the place of ferries. In 1964, the longest bridge in the world was built in New York over Now York Bay . It is called the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. This bridge has two roads, one over the other. Each road is wide enough for six lanes of traffic.", "id": "middle2798.txt"}
