It's a friend who wants to tell you his or her latest health problems. You hate to be impolite and cut your friend off, but what can you do? Stephanie Winston, author of Stephanie Winston's Best Organizing Tips, offers his advice:\nDon't ask questions like \"What's new?\" They give the information that you have time to talk. After \"hello\", get right to the heart of the matter.\nTime your calls wisely. If you make a call right before lunch or dinner, or at the end of the workday, people chat less.\nSet a time limit. Start with, \"Hi, I've only got a few minutes, but I wanted to talk to you about....\" Or, \"Gee, I'd love to talk more, but I only have a couple of minutes before I have to leave.\"\nJump on a pause. Even the most talkative caller has to pause now and then. Quickly say, \"It has been great talking with you.\" Then end the conversation.\nForget niceties. Some people just don't take a hint. Cut your caller off and say, \"I'd like to talk to you longer, but I'm afraid I have no enough time. Good bye.\" Then hang up.\nFind \"a partner in crime\". If nothing else works, ask someone in your home to help you. For example, one woman gives a sign to her husband, who shouts, \"Jane, I think the roast chicken is burning.\"\nAvoid the phone completely. Use an answering machine to screen calls. If you have an important message for a chatterbox, leave the message when he or she isn't in.", "id": "middle2796.txt"}
