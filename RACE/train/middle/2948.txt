Just like children, they use a \" look and learn\" ways when they go about their tasks.\nScientists at Oxford universities designed an experiment to test if the dogs have the ability to copy humans' actions by using a simple wooden box. 10 owners showed their dogs how to open the wooden box .Sometimes they use their heads to push it and sometimes they use their hands.\n10 dogs were divided into two groups---Group1 and Group2. In the first part of the test, Group1 were rewarded with a piece of meat for copying their owner's actions. Group2 were rewarded with food for not copying and using other ways. With each dog the experiment was repeated hundreds of times. Scientists recorded the time to see which group was first to get 85% right. They found that Group1finished the task much sooner than Group2.\nIn the second part of the test, all the dogs were only rewarded for copying the way that their owners used. Group1 reached the 85% mark more quickly than Group2.\nSo the scientists draw a conclusion: \"Like humans, dogs can copy actions that they see. Dogs' imitative behavior is shaped more by their interactions with humans than by evolution .\"\nScientists said,\"A dog's behavior is influenced much like that of a child; they look and learn similar behavior. We hope that owners understand the importance of their actions and use this knowledge to set good examples and therefore have a good effect on the behavior of their pets.\"", "id": "middle2948.txt"}
