Yet they have changed a lot since 1804, when the first train moved at 8 km/hr. Today's high speed trains can go 300 km/hr or faster. Besides their speed, they have many advantages over other transportation types.\nJapan built the world's first high speed railway. In 1964, Japan's \"Shinkansen\" trains started traveling between Osaka and Tokyo at 200 km/hr. Over time, more lines, as well as faster trains, were built.\nKorea, England, and the USA, now have their own high speed systems. Taiwan Province's started running in 2007. Its trains are based on two types of Shinkansen trains. They can carry 989 people and travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung in less than two hours.\nThese systems are expensive to build, but they have many advantages. For example, they are good for the environment. Trains on the London to Paris line create 1/10 the pollution that planes create. High speed trains are also safer and cleaner than cars.\nSuper fast trains can even help a country's economy . They make it easier to travel to faraway places. That helps businesses and land values in those areas. It's no wonder so many countries are building their own high speed railways.", "id": "middle5003.txt"}
