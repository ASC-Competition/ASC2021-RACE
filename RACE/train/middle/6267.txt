They told us that they never forgot those days when they were in the army, during which they lived hard lives but spared no effort to fight against the enemies.\nNow in the year 2015 comes the first great parade  in the 21stcentury. September 3rdis the 70thanniversary  of the victory of the anti-fascist   war. This day is considered as an important moment for China, as well as the world. 49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion.\nIn preparation for the parade, the soldiers worked hard every day. In order to walk well in the three hundred meters distance on the Tian'anmen Square, they had to receive extremely strict training. Each day, they got up early in the morning and started the 10 hours' practice.\nWhen a reporter arrived, it was raining heavily outside, but none of the soldiers stopped training. Nothing can stop their training, and no one can stop their deep love to their motherland.\nThe reporter asked, \"The training is so hard but why does nobody give up?\" \"It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony. I consider it a great honor. I must try my best.\" One of the participants  answered. In fact, everyone takes pride in taking part in this big parade because they want to show the spirit of Chinese army, the power of Chinese army, as well as the determination of keeping the world in peace.\nFrom the soldiers, we learned the power of dreams. If one has a dream, he will get over any difficulties that get in the way to make the dream come true.", "id": "middle6267.txt"}
