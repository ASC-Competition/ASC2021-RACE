While most of the other students hurriedly left to enjoy the pleasant weather or to relax at the student union, Julie remained to ask me questions about the next week's exam. She had clearly already done some serious studying.\nJulie never made it to the exam. The day after our conversation, she was hit by a large truck as she rode a bike through a crossroads. I was sad to hear that Julie lay unconscious   in a hospital across town from our university.\nNurses silently came and went from Julie's room. Her parents stood nearby quietly. Then the doctor entered the room and said to Julie's parents and two brothers, \"Your Julie has only a few hours to live.\" He continued to ask, \"Would you think about donating some of Julie's organs  ?\"\nAt the same time in a neighboring city, a woman called Mary was trying to see better in her small living room. Her eyes followed every movement of her lively two-year-old baby. This mother was storing up memories when she could no longer see her child. Several cities away, a young father called John was reading to his two sons in the hospital. However, he was told to have only weeks to live. His only hope was a kidney transplant  .\nThe two parents looked at each other, the doctor could see tears in their eyes. \"Yes. Julie had once said she wanted to donate her organs in the event of her death. Julie always gave to others while she was alive. She would like to give in death.\"\nWithin twenty-four hours, Mary was told that she would receive one of Julie's eyes, and John was told to start preparing for a kidney transplant. Julie's other organs would give life to other waiting patients.\n\"Julie died right after her twentieth birthday. Nothing could possibly be as heartbreaking as the death of your child,\" says Julie's mother. She continues, \"But Julie's life was a gift to us. Knowing that in her death, she gave the gift of life and sight to others is _ to us. \"", "id": "middle5021.txt"}
