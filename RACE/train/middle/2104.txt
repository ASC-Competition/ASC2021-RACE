But sometimes it does not seem like the same language. In fact, there are some important differences between British English and American English.\nFirst of all, they sound very different. Often, Americans don't say each word separately. They say several words together. Americans may say \"I dunno\" instead of \"I don't know\". Or they may say \"Whaddya say?\" instead of \"What did you say?\" however, the British are more careful in their speech. They usually say all the words and keep them _ .\nWords sometimes have different meanings too. Some American words are never used in England. The same thing is true of some British words in America. For example, the vocabulary for cars and driving is very different. Americans drive trucks, but in England people drive lorries.\nMany expressions are also different in the two countries. In England, if you are going to telephone your friends, you \"phone them up\". In America, you \"give them a call\".\nThere're also some differences in grammar. For example, when Americans ask a question., they say \"Do you have a storybook?\" But the British often say \"Have you a storybook?\"\nAll these differences can be confusing  if you are learning English. But most languages are like this. Languages change over time. When people live in separate places, the languages change in different ways. This is what has happened to English. It can also happen to other languages, such as French. Many people in Canada speak French but their French is very different from the French of France.", "id": "middle2104.txt"}
