Success belongs to those who are willing to go after it and try their best to do what they have to do. Here are some useful practical ways for you if you want to be a success.\nDesire. Desire is the strong wish to achieve a goal. Without desire you have nothing. Before you can run with desire, your goal must be plain, clear, and it must also be exciting.\nShow up. Seventy percent of success in life is showing up. You can't have a best seller, if you have never written a book. You can't get your dream job, if you're afraid to turn in an application. Showing up doesn't guarantee  success, but if you don't show up, you won't succeed.\nFail. Unless you're willing to have a try, fail unhappily, and have another try, success won't happen. To have success you have to do things the right way, but often the only way to do something right is to first fail at it. As Thomas J. Watson said, a simple formula   for success is to double your rate of failure  . So welcome failure, become a student of failure, learn from failure, and soon you will succeed.\nWork Harder. _ Success is not about doing what the common person can't do. It's about doing what the common person is unwilling to do. And on a deeper level, it's about creating habits that the common person is unwilling to create. It's the habit of doing things with excellence that causes success.\nEnjoy the Journey. Success is a journey, not a destination  . Success is not a certain car or a certain house or a certain happy marriage. Success is the enjoyment of the journey. You have to enjoy the journey.\nSomeone once said, \"Unless you change how you are, you will always have what you've got.\" You have to change, you will change, and you will succeed.", "id": "middle5060.txt"}
