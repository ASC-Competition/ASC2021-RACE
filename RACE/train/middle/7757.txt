Every year we have forest fires somewhere. Many scientists believe that the weather is changing.\nThe earth will perhaps be warmed by about 7degC at the South Pole  and the North Pole. The ice will be melt . The sea level  will rise by about 7 meters. As a result, water will cover cities like London, Tokyo and New York. Some ports  and towns along the coasts will disappear under water.\nSome other scientists think that the dust, smoke and pollution from coal, wood and oil fires will block out  the ultraviolet rays . Then the earth will become colder and great sheets of ice will cover Europe and North America.\nWhen chemicals in the air mix with rain, we have acid  rain. Acid rain can bring us great harm. It destroys  forests and kills life in lakes and rivers.\nPeople are beginning to see how serious the problem is. They find it important to work with nature instead of against it. They are trying to save the earth in many different ways. But one of the most important things to do is to make people understand that saving the earth is saving ourselves.\n,.", "id": "middle7757.txt"}
