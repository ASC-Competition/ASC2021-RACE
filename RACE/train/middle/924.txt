Suddenly there was something wrong with the machine while it was flying in the air. The plane began to fall down. The pilot told the people there were only four parachutes  . They all became worried and started to make excuses.\n\"I must go,\" said the pilot, taking one of the parachutes and jumped out. The first person stood up, \"I'm a doctor,\" he said. \"I help people live longer and I save lives.\" He took a parachute and jumped out.\nThe next person said, \"I must have a parachute.
