You can have a lot of fun here, especially on holidays.\nThere are many festivals in Australia. The most important one is obviously Christmas. Each year, the summer holidays at every high school last about two months from the beginning of December to February, which covers the Christmas time. Since it is a long holiday, most overseas students love to fly back to their home countries to spend the time with their families and friends, but a few students still stay in Australia during the holiday to get part-time jobs. It is quite easy to find a part-time job at Christmas. Students often take part in another major social activity. They go to the beach to have fun in the sunshine. The summer in Australia is from December to February, so going to the beach in December is very popular among Australians.\nEaster in March is another important holiday in the year. It actually combines  \"Good Friday\" and \"Easter Monday\". Almost every shop closes on Good Friday. And people usually go to see Easter Show.\nThe Chinese New year is not a public holiday in Australia, so every Chinese student still has to go to school to study and do his or her normal duties.", "id": "middle2306.txt"}
