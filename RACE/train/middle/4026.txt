I want to have a special party to celebrate my 12th birthday. After discussing it with my family, I decided to have a Hello Kitty theme birthday party.\nHello Kitty Birthday Invitations\nAn invitation in the shape of a skirt is a fun way to invite my friends to the party. My sister, Lisa, will help me make the invitations. My mom tells me to send out the invitations 3~5 weeks before the date of the party. My birthday party is on December 21, so I will send out the invitations before November 24.\nHello Kitty Theme Decorations\nThe party will be held in our garden. I plan to put some white and pink balloons around the garden. There will be a vase which is full of pink flowers on each table and a small Hello Kitty on each chair.\nHello Kitty Birthday Party Menu\nMy parents will cook some delicious food. All of them will be named after Hello Kitty's friends, such as Rory and Fifi. I will _ a birthday cake in the shape of a Hello Kitty at Mrs Green'S Cake Store at the beginning of December.\nI hope my friends will enjoy themselves at the special party.", "id": "middle4026.txt"}
