Our class used to be noisy, because some students were talking when a student was answering the teacher's questions. So our head teacher made some class rules.\nIn class, we should observe   the rules. Now, I list some rules in our class:\n1. No talking when Someone is speaking.\n2. No sleeping in class.\n3. No eating in class.\n4. Students can't arrive late for school. Be always on time.\n5. No playing in class.\n6. No laughing when someone makes a mistake.\n7. No smoking or drinking.\n8. Students can't dye   hair. Boys can't let their hair grow too long.\n9. In the schoolyard  , students can't ride bikes.\n10. Students can't fight with each other.\nMaybe some students don't obey some of the rules. They may smoke, fight and dye hair. But most students think the rules are fine and say they will obey the rules. I think because our class has such rules, we will study better and better.", "id": "middle5424.txt"}
