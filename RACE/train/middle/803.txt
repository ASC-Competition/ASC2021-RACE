He was wearing a dark suit and carrying a suitcase. His name was Terry and he and he had lived away from home for twenty years. In fact he was in prison ,\nTerry was feeling totally depressed because everything in his hometown had changed. The park where he used to play was now a car park. The house where he was born had dis appeared and in its place,  ironically , was a bank. Terry wanted to have a cup of coffee in the old small restaurant where he used to go with his friend after school,   but it had become a fast food restaurant. He entered it,   sat down,   and asked for a cup of coffee. Then he felt sadder when he thought of what he had seen.\nWhile paying for the coffee he found an old ticket in his wallet. It was for a pair of shoes he had taken to be repaired the day before the bank robbery 20 years ago. The shoe repairer was an old man then, so Terry was sure that he must be dead.
