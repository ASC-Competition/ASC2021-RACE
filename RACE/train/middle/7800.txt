It seems like an impossible job, But Priscilla Chan wants to make it come true.\nChan, 31, is from the United States. Many people may know her as a wife of Mark Zuckerberg , the founder of Facebook. But Chan herself has done a lot to help people.\nChan and Zuckerberg said in September that they would give out $3 billion , that's about Y=20 billion in the next 10 years to help deal with all of the world's diseases. As a doctor for children, Chan was a big driver in this decision. \"By investing  in science today, we hope to build a future in which all of our children can live long and meaningful lives,\" she said.\nShe cares about not only children's health but also their education. Before becoming a doctor, Chan taught science to the 4th and 5th graders at a school in California for a year. That year she started a project called The Primary School. It provides education for children from kindergarten to the 12th grade.\nChan herself knows how important education is to a child. She has a Chinese father and a Vietnamese mother. Her parents didn't come to the US with much. But they worked hard to make sure Chan and their other two daughters had the best opportunities  possible. Chan went to Harvard University in 2003 and now works as a doctor.\n\"I realized that I was so lucky to be what I was,\" said Chan. \"It drives me to make sure others, no matter what background they have, can have their opportunities, to reach their dreams and their full potential .\"", "id": "middle7800.txt"}
