A French Digital Kitchen has been developed at Newcastle University in the UK. It teaches students how to cook French food and speak French at the same time. For the first time, students can learn a language by the following cooking steps.\nAll grammar and  _  have been carefully chosen to make sure the users can understand French well. After learning for some time, the users can test themselves by doing a short test on the computer.\nThe kitchen project was started by Professor Paul Seedhouse. He became interested in the idea after he visited another kind of talking kitchen. He said, \" The purpose of the French Digital Kitchen is to make learning a language more interesting and more educational.\"\nHow does the kitchen work? There is a computer in the kitchen. With this computer,  the users can first choose a French recipe( ) that they want to follow. Using information in the computer, the kitchen starts to guide the users how to make a French dish. If you follow the instructions on the computer, it moves on to the next. If you go wrong, the program goes back and repeats the recipe or information. At any time, the users can also ask the kitchen to repeat the recipe or any information..\nThe new kitchen can be used in school, universities and even people's homes. The researchers will also be developing the European Digital Kitchen, for the next three years.", "id": "middle4177.txt"}
