There were many cows, horses, and small animals on the farm.\nSuddenly she saw a kangaroo under her window. It was interesting to see that the kangaroo was wearing an old jacket. It stood there and looked hungry. Mrs. Brown gave some bread and waterto it. The kangaroo had them all. Then it became happy and jumped away. Suddenly something dropped on the ground there was $300 and a photo in it. That was a man's photo with his name \"John\" on it. John? She looked more carefully and remembered she had a brother many years ago.
