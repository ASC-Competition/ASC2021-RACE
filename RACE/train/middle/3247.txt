She found Broo while he was busy eating honey.\n\"Mr. Bear,\" the Princess said, \"you are welcome in Nahloo. Here we share with each other. We don't take things from each other.\"\nBroo thought about it for a moment and realized that he had made a mistake. \"Well,\" he said, \"maybe drinking all that milk wasn't the best idea.\"\nThe Princess continued, \"Mr. Bear, you can drink and eat, but you won't feel good because you have never made any contribution to anyone else. I think you'll find that it is better to be full in your heart, not just in your stomach.\" After saying this, the Princess went back to the castle, leaving Broo alone.\nOne day, Broo was going to take lots of cookies from the rabbits, then he remembered what the Princess said to him. So Broo decided not to eat the cookies. The rabbits were surprised and said, \"Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Bear. Now these cookies will taste sweeter because they are given by you, my friend. If you like, come back tomorrow and we can have the cookies together.\"\nBroo was filled with joy and went through the land. He gave back everything he had taken. In return, he received a promise from everyone to share their food with him. Broo was so delighted that he started dancing in the moonlight with the Princess as his partner.", "id": "middle3247.txt"}
