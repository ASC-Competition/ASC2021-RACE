They taught him, encouraged him or cared a lot about him.\nOne was a teacher. She once taught William geography, and William loved geography all his life. So he wrote a letter of thanks to her.\nHe got the teacher's letter later. It began, \"My dear Willie.\" He was very happy. Now over 50, he didn't think someone would call him \"Willie\". Here is that letter.\nMy dear Willie,\nI can't tell you how much your letter meant to me. I am in my eighties, living alone in a small room and cooking my own meals. You will be interested to know that I taught school for 50 years and yours is the first letter of appreciation I ever got. It came on a cold morning and it made me feel very warm.\n...\nWilliam cried when he read the letter. She was one of the people that William hadn't thanked in his past. She helped him to believe in himself. He would never forget her.\nThere are some people we should always remember, because they helped to shape our life. William Stidger found a way to show his appreciation--he wrote them letters.\nWho are some of the people that you need to say thank you to in your past? It may not be too late to say \"Thanks\".", "id": "middle5160.txt"}
