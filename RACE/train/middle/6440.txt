I'm Roy Darby, and this is my show. This is a television show for all the families and I know you're going to enjoy it.\nLet's start with a story I heard the other day about a very proud pig. This pig lived on a farm with a lot of other animals. And of all the animals on the farm, he thought he was the most important. But it was not enough that he himself thought this way. He had to be sure that the other animals thought so, too. So he went up to one of the chickens and asked, \"Who is the most important animal on the farm?\" Straight away, the chicken answered, \"You're, Master.\" Then he asked one of the farm dogs and he got the same reply.\nNext, he asked a cow. When the cow seemed uncertain of the right answer, the pig looked angry and showed his teeth. \"Oh, you are, of course, Master Pig,\" said the cow. \"Of course,\" the pig said. \"There is no doubt about it.\"\nAt last, the pig asked a big horse, \"Who is the most important animal on the farm?\" The horse lifted one foot, rolled the pig over, and placed his foot on the pig's head. \"All right,\" said the pig, \"you don't have to do that just because you don't know the answer.\"", "id": "middle6440.txt"}
