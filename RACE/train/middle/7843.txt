He was born in\n1942. He's a world well-known on space and time. Stephen is researching some very big questions, such as: How did the universe begin? How will it end?\nStephen was a student at Oxford University. He studied math and science. Then, at the\nage of twenty, he became sick. He was so young, but the doctors said to his family, \"He has only two more years to live.\" As a matter of fact, the doctors were wrong---- he didn't die. He can't  walk now but he uses a wheelchair . He can't feed himself and get in or out of bed himself. But he refused to give in to the condition. He talks with the help of a computer. After Oxford, Stephen went to Cambridge University. Three years later, in 1965, he became a doctor of philosophy .\nBecause of his serious health problems, it was difficult for him to draw diagrams \nor to write. So he started to think in pictures. With this new way of thinking, he became one of the most famous scientists in the world. In 1991, he met the Pope  in Rome. They talked about his ideas. Then in 1998, he wrote his first important book, A Brief History of Time. It sold more than 5.5 million copies in 33 different languages. He was once invited to China, he impressed us with his self-confidence, humorous and witty  conversation.", "id": "middle7843.txt"}
