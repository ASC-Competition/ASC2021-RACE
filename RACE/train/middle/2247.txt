Do you know why? Animals like tigers, lions, and bears usually live in forests or mountains. They run, jump, play with their children and catch small animals for food. But now they have to stay in cages ,small rooms in the zoo. They don't have to find food by themselves because the zoo keepers feed them. They do nothing but eat, walk and sleep every day.
