I just couldn't imagine why she had made her parents so angry.\nIt seemed that Katie had been spending money in the lunchroom. Her parents explained that Katie brought a great homemade lunch each day, and there was no reason for her to buy school lunch. They wondered why but failed.So they asked me to help them get to the bottom of this situation.\nThe next day, I asked Katie to my office. \"Why are you buying lunches, Katie? What happened to your homemade lunch?\" I asked. \"I lose it,\" she replied. \"I don't believe you, Katie. Is someone stealing your lunch, Katie?\"  I asked. \"No. I just lose it,\" she said.Well, there was nothing else I could do.\nThe problem was still unsolved the next week when I noticed a boy who was new to the school sitting alone at a lunch table. He always looked sad and scared. I thought I would go and sit with him for a while. As I walked towards him, I noticed the lunch bag on the table. The name on the bag said \"Katie\".\nNow I understood and I talked to Katie. It seemed that the new boy never brought a lunch, and he wouldn't go to the lunch line for a free lunch. He had told Katie his secret and asked her not to tell anyone that his parents wanted him to get a free lunch at school. Katie asked me not to tell her parents, but I drove to her house that evening after I was sure that she was in bed. I had never seen parents so proud of their child.\nKatie still buys lunch every day at school. And every day, as she heads out of the door, her  mom hands her a delicious homemade lunch.", "id": "middle6428.txt"}
