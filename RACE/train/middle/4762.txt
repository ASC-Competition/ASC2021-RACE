Next year she is going to university to study Chinese, but now she's living in Belize. Pauline says, \"I'm working with other people here to save the coral reefs   in the sea near Belize. The reefs here are beautiful, but if the sea water is very polluted, the coral will die. I'm helping to do research on the coral and the fish that live around the reefs. All over the world, coral reefs are dying. We need to do something about the problem before it's too late.\"\n\"I'm staying with a family here and I help do some housework.

I want to travel around\nBelize and Central America.\"", "id": "middle4762.txt"}
