One day, I asked her why she practiced so much. She said, \"I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship . I like basketball and I want to be the best player in college. My dad told me, \"If the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\" She never changed her mind. Whenever she was in junior high school or senior high school. One day, before she graduate from senior high school, I saw her sitting on the grass sadly. I asked her what was wrong. She told me that her coach said she was too short to be a good basketball player, so she should stop dreaming about going to college. She was heartbroken and it made me feel bad, too. Then she smiled and told me her father said to her, \"If you really want to play for the scholarship of a good college, nothing but yourself can stop your dream.\" The next year, she and her team went to a big game she was seen by a coach of a famous college team and was offered a scholarship to the women's basketball team of their college. She was getting the college education that she had dreamed of. \"If the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\" It is true.", "id": "middle1437.txt"}
