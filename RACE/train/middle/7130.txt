When he got there, he saw a lot of fruit. Among them there was a big basket of very red, long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop. \"I'd like a kilogram of this kind of fruit, please,\" he said to the shop keeper. After the keeper gave him the fruit, he began to eat some of it. \"Oh, my God!\" he shouted. His eyes watered, his mouth watered; his eyes were burning, his head was burning; and his face became red. As he coughed, he jumped up and down, saying, \"Ah! Ah! Ah!\"\nBut he still kept eating the fruit! Some people looking at him and said, \"You're crazy, man. Those are chilies !
