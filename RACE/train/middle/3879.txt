This game had gone into overtime   twice. Until the last goal was scored, no one had any idea which team would win.\nDave felt so bad because his team had lost. He liked playing soccer, but he liked winning even more. Now the two teams should have a picnic together. Dave did not want to eat lunch with the other team. The other team would probably brag   by talking about how they won the game.\nDave went to the locker room   to change out of his soccer clothes. There the coach talked to the team about what they had done well. They also talked about how they could improve. Then everybody walked outside towards the picnic table.\nOne of the players from the other team was standing near the picnic table. He handed Dave a paper plate. \"Hi, I'm Miguel,\" he said.\n\"Hi,\" Dave replied, looking down at the ground.\n\"You played great,\" Miguel said. \"I didn't think we were going to win.\"\nDave was surprised. Miguel was not bragging at all.\n\"Thanks,\" Dave said to Miguel. \"You played great, too.\"\nDave felt happy. Dave promised himself that the next time his team won a game, he would not brag to the other team. It was wonderful to win, but it was even more important to be a good winner.", "id": "middle3879.txt"}
