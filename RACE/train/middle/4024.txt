I am really outgoing when I am with my family at home, but I almost never talk at school. I really want to get over it, but I just don't know how. What should I do?\nA shy girl Rachel\nDear Rachel,\nThe following ways may be able to help you out.\nTo begin with, you need to SMILE to others. If you are meeting someone and they look scared and angry, would you talk to them? Probably not. This may be how people feel about you. If you are smiling and if your eyes are saying that you're happy to see others, the conversation will be easier for you and them.\nNext, do some volunteer work at school. Many shy kids don't do these because they always wonder if they can do very well. In fact, when you take part in activities that interest you, you'll find you can really do very well, and you will meet people with the same interests.\nStart today one small step with one welcoming smile or one volunteer work and show the world inside you, and then you'll become a person who has interests and talents and self confidence. I believe that this is the person you want to be. Only you can make it happen.", "id": "middle4024.txt"}
