I live with my brother Peter. Beijing is big and great. There are many beautiful places and much delicious food here. I like Beijing very much.\nPeter and I are in the same grade, but we are in different classes. We live far from the school and it takes us a long time to go to school. We have to get up at 6:20 in the morning, and then at 6:30 we ride bikes to the bus stop. It takes us about 20 minutes. At about 7:00, we take the bus to school. We get to school at about 7:30.\nWe have four classes in the morning and two in the afternoon. I think Chinese is too difficult, but Peter thinks it is easy. He can speak Chinese very well and he often helps me with it.\nHow is everything going with you in the USA? Write to me soon.\nLove,\nKate\n,.", "id": "middle7041.txt"}
