They told the pilot to come back and pick them up in about two weeks. By the end of the two weeks, they had hunted a lot of animals and they wanted to put all of them onto the plane.\nBut the pilot said, \"This plane can only take one lamb. You'll have to leave the others behind.\"\nThen one hunter said, \"But last year, another pilot with the same plane let us take two lambs and some other animals onto the plane.\"\nSo the new pilot thought about it. Finally he said, \"OK, since you did it last year, I think this year we can do it again.\" Then they put all the animals they had hunted onto the plane, and the plane took off. Five minutes later, it crashed.\nThe three men looked around, and one hunter asked the other one, \"Where do you think we are now?\"\nThe other hunter looked around and said, \"I think we're about one mile away from the place where the plane crashed last year.\"", "id": "middle7054.txt"}
