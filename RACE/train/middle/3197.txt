It speaks louder than words.\nAccording to specialists, our bodies send out more messages than we realize. In fact, non-verbal  communication takes up about fifty percent of what we usually mean. And body language is especially important, when we try to communicate across cultures.\nIndeed, what is called body language is so much a part of us that it's actually often unnoticed. And misunderstandings happen as a result of it. For example, different cultures treat the distance between people differently. Northern Europeans usually do not like having bodily contact ,even with friends. And certainly not with strangers. People from the Latin American countries, on the other hand, touch each other quite a lot. So it's possible that in conversation it may look like a Latino is following a Norwegian  all over the room.
