Among them, half wish to study at the undergraduate level.\nUK students have increasing interest in studying or working in a European country through the EU's Erasmus Program, an EU student exchange program started in 1987. Recent Erasmus statistics  show that nearly 15,600 UK students spent up to a year in another European country through the program during 2013-2014 school year, up 115 percent since 2007.\nThe figures reflect that more young people in the UK are realizing the value of receiving international experience. \"The UK needs graduates who have the skills and confidence to compete worldwide, and can compete against foreign talent that may speak more languages and have wider international experience,\" said Rebecca Hughes, director of education at the British Council.\nMost UK students would like to go to the United States, followed by Australia, France, Canada and Germany, the findings show, but 42 percent of those who took the questionnaire were interested in traveling outside of the English-speaking world.\nWhy do UK students want to go abroad? Among those who are interested in overseas study, nearly 50 percent want to have fun traveling and exploring different cultures, while 30 percent want to work for an international company and live overseas. About 15 percent said they wanted to go to the best university and get the best education offered worldwide. What's more, the high cost of UK university studies plays a role in over half of students' interest in overseas study.\nAlso, the study found the biggest schooling check to studying abroad was a lack of foreign language skills--chosen by over half of those who were not interested or had not made a decision about studying overseas. But the top non-schooling check for students was the great cost.", "id": "middle6665.txt"}
