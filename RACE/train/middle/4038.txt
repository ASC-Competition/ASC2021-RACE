It blooms  only in the morning hours.  For the afternoon sun is too hot for it. Every day for nearly two weeks, I see those beautiful flowers.\nThis spring, I started a wildflower garden in our yard,. I can look out of the kitchen window while doing the dishes and see the flowers.\nEvery day I drove past the flowers thinking \"I'll stop on my way home and dig them.\" \"See. I don't want to get my good clothes dirty.\" Whatever the reason, I never stopped to dig them.\nOne day on my way home from work. I was sad to see the pretty blue flowers were gone. I thought to myself. \"You wanted too long. You should have done it when you first saw them blooming this spring.\"\nA week ago we were shocked and sad to learn that my oldest sister-in-law  was badly ill. She is 20 years older than my husband and unfortunately, because of age and distance, we haven't been as close as we all would have been.\nI couldn't help but see the connection between the pretty blue flowers and the relationship between my husband's sister and us. I do believe that God has given us some time left to plant some wonderful memories that will bloom every year for us.\nAnd yes, if I see the blue flowers again. You can bet I'll stop and transplant   them to my wildflower garden.", "id": "middle4038.txt"}
