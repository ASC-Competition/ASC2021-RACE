Some doctors write clearly , but most doctors do not. Chemists  have more chances to read doctors' notes, but sometimes doctors write so badly that even the chemist can't read them.\nOne day a lady wrote to a doctor inviting him to have dinner at her house. The doctor wrote an answer, but he didn't write clearly and the lady couldn't read it.\n\"What shall I do?\" she said to her husband, \"I don't know whether he is coming or not.
