Are you ready if one hits your neighborhood next week? Find out what you need to do now before it is too late. Let's take an earthquake for example.\nDuring an earthquake, get under a strong object like the kitchen table. Don't leave the building during the shaking, or you might be hurt by falling objects from the outside of the building.\nWhen you are in bed during the night and an earthquake happens,simply roll off the bed. There will be a safe void around the bed.\nIf you are watching TV and you cannot easily run away by getting out through the door or window, then lie down and curl up  next to a sofa, or a large chair.\nNever go to the stairs. The stairs are likely part of the building to be broken. Even if the stairs are not destroyed by the earthquake,they may fall down later when people run down.\nTry to get into an open area away from trees,buildings,walls,advertisement boards and power lines if you are outdoors.\nIf you are driving when an earthquake suddenly happens,just stay in your car until the shaking ends.
