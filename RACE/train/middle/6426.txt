Suddenly, he saw a little tortoise  moving slowly on the sand. He started to look at it carefully and began to touch it with his hand. To his surprise, the tortoise stopped moving. It pulled in its head and legs, and closed its shell  tightly. He touched it again but the tortoise didn't move at all. Jack became angry. He used a stick and tried to make it open.\nWhen his father saw this, he stopped him and said, \"No, son, you mustn't do that! You will kill the tortoise. You won't get it open with a stick.\" Jack asked, \"Why?\" \"Just wait and see,\" his father answered. Then he picked up the tortoise and put it in a bag.\nAfter they came back home, the father took the tortoise out of the bag. He put it near the fireplace . After a few minutes, the tortoise began to move a little. Then the tortoise stretched out  its head and legs. At last, the tortoise began to move across the room. How excited Jack was when he saw this!\n\"Son, now you see,\" said his father, \"sometimes, you can't make someone do things he doesn't like. But if you get him warm first, he will do what you want him to do.\"", "id": "middle6426.txt"}
