She wanted very much to try a new way of cooking a fish, and she was very pleased with herself when the dish was ready. The fish was very hot, so she put it near the open window to make it cool. But five minutes later, when she came back for it, she was surprised to see her neighbor's cat, Mike, eating the fish. She was in time to stop the cat before it was too late.
