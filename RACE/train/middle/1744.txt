Sometimes they have problems with their schoolwork, and sometimes with their friends. _ Some people think the worst thing is to do nothing. Laura Mills, a teenager from Washington, agrees. \"Problems and worries are normal in life,\" says Laura. \"But I think talking to someone helps a lot. If we don't talk to someone, we'll certainly feel worse.\"\nLaura once lost her purse, and worried for days. She was afraid to tell her parents shout it. She even walked three miles to school each day because she didn't have any money. She just kept thinking. \"If I tell my parents, they'll be angry!\" But in the end, she talked to her parents and they were really understanding. Her dad said he sometimes made careless mistakes himself. They got her a new purse and asked her to be more careful. \"I will always remember to share my problems in the future!\" Laura says.\nRobert Hunt advises students about common problems. He feels the same way as Laura. \"It is best not to avoid our problems. We should always try to solve   them.\" He thinks that you can first find someone to talk to. This person doesn't need to be an expert   like himself. Students often forget that their parents have more experience than them, and are always there to help them.\nIn English, we say that sharing a problem is like cutting it in half. So you're halfway to solving a problem if you talk to someone about it!", "id": "middle1744.txt"}
