Twelve follows the same rule. It comes from twalif--\"two left\". Why teen is used instead of lif for 13 through 19? There is something sadly lost in history.\n911 for US Emergency   Calls\nEarly phones didn't use phone numbers--the operator had to connect your call by hand--and this led to the need for an emergency code  . But later phone numbers became popular, that changed. In 1967, 911 was chosen as the nationwide emergency call because it was easy to  remember and could be quickly dialed   on the phone.\n26.2 Miles in a Marathon  \nThe story began with an ancient Greek soldier carrying message from a battlefield   in Marathon to Athens. The modern marathon was born as a flagship event in the first Olympic Games, in 1896, with a distance   of about 25 miles (40 km), as long as the distance from Marathon to Athens. But race organizers for the 1908 Olympic Games in London wanted to add something special. The race began at Windsor Castle and ended at White City Stadium, with runners finishing only after passing the royal   box. The distance was 26.2 miles (42.1 km). And since 1924 this distance has been kept in marathon.\n28 Days in February\nBefore using the Gregorian calendar that we use today, one of the first Roman calendars had only 304 days and ten months (March through December), with six months of 30 days and four of 31 days. The second king of Rome improved the old calendar. He added 50 days for January and February. To make the new months longer, he took one day from each of the 30-day months, making 56 days to divide between January and February (or 28 days each). Later January was given one more day to add up to 355 days a year, but February still had 28 days. That's how it became the shortest month and it stayed that way ever since.", "id": "middle5382.txt"}
