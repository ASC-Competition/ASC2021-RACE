Welcome to Henton Hospital Radio. Before our music program begins, I'm going to repeat some of our hospital rules.\nThe hospital can sleep 800 patients. There are 8 beds in each ward .The visiting hours are in the afternoon from 2:30 to 3:30 and in the evening from 7:00 to 8:00. But remember only two visitors at a time. Sorry about that, but you can see what would happen if we didn't have these rules.\nThe other rules are about our time schedule. We start quite early-you might not be used to that. We wake you at 6 o'clock, and breakfast is at 8 o'clock, lunch at noon. There's tea at 3:30 and supper is at 6' o clock.\nYou can see the \"No Smoking\" sign-we don't allow smoking in the wards. I'm sure you understand why. However, if you do need to smoke, there are some smoking-rooms for you.\nYou will find the radio switch  on the wall near your bed, with your own headphones, if you want to listen. It's our own hospital radio wishing you a quick recovery{}.", "id": "middle7870.txt"}
