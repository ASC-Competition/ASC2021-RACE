They sat down and ordered bread and milk. The white waiter just said \"We don't serve blacks\". The young men did not move. They were tired to death of segregation  and of being kicked around. The manager was called. When he saw the angry look in their eyes, he said that he was sorry, but it was not possible to serve them.\nThe next day, more young black people came, and even more came the day after to the restaurant. Then a gang of white youths came in and attacked them. Most of the blacks were beaten up and were black and blue all over. After that the police rushed in, the several people were put in prison---all of them were black, although they had not done anything wrong---just because they were black.\nThe news spread quickly through the black living areas in the city. A large crowd held a meeting round the restaurant the following day, forcing  the restaurant to shut. Young men, black and white, made speeches protesting against segregation and pointing out that black people only wanted to live a life in the same way that whites did. They gave out leaflets and soon the movement spread to other cities. Business became so bad at that particular restaurant that the owners were forced to give and served blacks.\nNowadays, all the blacks are served in all restaurants open to the public in America.", "id": "middle7333.txt"}
