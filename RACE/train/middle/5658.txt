As years went by, I wanted to get a new one, and my father agreed. We went to many stores and looked at many flyers  . At last we bought an HP computer.\nDuring the first week, I noticed that our computer had some problems. I tried to fix it, but failed. Finally I had to phone the HP company. After five hours' hard work, the computer still did not work. My dad didn't have a choice but to return the whole thing.\nA few days later, we decided that I should go on the internet and order some parts to build a new computer by myself.\nIt was not an easy thing for me to deal with it, but in the end I finished. From these setbacks  , I have learned, and now believe if the computer that I bought from the store didn't have problems, then I would not learn how to build a new one.
