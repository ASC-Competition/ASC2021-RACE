Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life.\nAbout 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there.\nOn Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called \"Chocolate or Toys\". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice.\nThis exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining .\nA girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict  and how much she hated her mother.\n\"I want a new mom,\" she cried.\n\"Unluckily, you can't have one,\" the leader replied.\n\"You have to accept the mother that you have.\"\nThis hit me hard. I realized that, for better or worse, my mom was my mom. I couldn't choose another mom, but I could try to make the best of the situation.", "id": "middle4421.txt"}
