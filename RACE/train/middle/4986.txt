He did not give much attention to where he was going. Very soon he knew he lost his way, but he kept on driving hoping he would meet someone or find his way back.\nIt was a long way. For many hours he kept on driving. When it was almost dark he saw a farmer who was working in a field. He stopped and shouted, \"Hello, farmer!\" \"Hello, yourself!\" the farmer answered, still working.\n\"Where does this road go?\"\n\"I have never seen it go anywhere. It always stays where it is.\" said the farmer, without stopping his work.\n\"How far is it to the next town?\" said the stranger, with a little louder voice.\n\"I don't know.

But at least I'm not lost.\"", "id": "middle4986.txt"}
