And don't be afraid to get help from teachers.\"\nApril Madlangbanyan,17\n\"If you have trouble getting along with a specific teacher,pray about it.Ask God to help you see that teacher through HIS EYES,not your own.And talk with that teacher.Good communication can strengthen any relationship-even with a hard-to-get-along-with teacher.\"\nLisa Shaw, 21\n\"Being a good student means being organized.Remember to bring all your supplies, everything-to each class every day.Make sure that you'll never skip class.And when you're in class,really pay attention! Don't let yourself daydream or write notes to friends.Completing your homework on time is also important.\"\nVictoria Walsh.16\n\"When you're having trouble getting along with a certain teacher,stay calm! You may not agree with him or her,but you've got to remember the teacher is the authority  figure.So make sure that you're respectful and open-minded.Ask for a specific time the two of you can talk.Explain yourself and address problem,not the teacher.\"\n----Amanda Baken,18\n\"Being a good student means studying often,not just cramming before a test.Identify your weak areas.For example,maybe you don't have good reading skills or it's hard for you to take notes.Once you identify what your weakness is,ask for help in these specific areas.Be willing to go in early or stay after school to get extra help.Go into the school year knowing that being a good student will require time and effort!\"\nTiffany Irving,20", "id": "middle4844.txt"}
