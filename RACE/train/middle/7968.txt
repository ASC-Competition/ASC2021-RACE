Then we usually go to see a doctor. Doctors know a lot about what makes us ill. They may give us something to take. The medicine often makes us well again.\nBut sometimes the doctor's medicine doesn't work. A sick person does not get well. The pain doesn't go away. There was such man. He was in hospital, but he wasn't well. Then he found a new \"doctor\" inside himself. This \"doctor\" was his own sense of humor . He saw funny films. He read funny books. And he liked to learn something interesting. Laughing took away his pain. Then he was able to sleep and rest. His own happy feeling helped him to feel well again. And he told his story in a book. He said that laughing was his best \"medicine\". His doctor thought so, too.\nAnother man was ill, and he had a terrible pain in his back. The doctors could not stop it from hurting. So the man began to \"picture\" his pain. In his head he \"drew\" a picture of a dog. He imagined  it as a real dog. And it was biting  his back. It was hurting him. Then the man talked softly to the dog. He put his hand on the dog's head. He made friends with the dog. And his pain went away!\nThese stories may surprise you. But more and more people are getting well in this way. So call on the \"doctor\" inside your own head. And stay happy and well!", "id": "middle7968.txt"}
