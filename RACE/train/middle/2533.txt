The seeds are affected by the radiation   and low gravity in space. When they are brought back to the earth, these seeds produce vegetables that are bigger and healthier than normal vegetables. However, some people worry about eating space vegetables. They think that space vegetables might not be good for us and could make us get sick because of the radiation in space. However, people should not be frightened because space vegetables are very healthy.\nHere are some facts that you should know about space vegetables.\nSpace vegetables are grown from seeds that are carefully chosen.
