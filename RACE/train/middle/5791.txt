I'm Jason. On Monday, I usually wake up late and have no time to have breakfast. I can't find my books or my school cap. At last, I find my books and my school cap in the bathroom. I have to wait for a bus and I am nearly late for school.\nThe first lesson on Monday morning is Maths. I like it because I'm good at Maths.\nThe next lesson is French. I like French. It's nice to be able to talk with somebody in another language.\nAt last, it is eleven o'clock -- time for break. After having a break, we have two Latin lessons. There are a lot of boys in our class who don't like Latin. I don't like it, either.\nAt half past twelve, it is time for lunch -- a meat pie, potatoes or cabbage and a glass of juice or milk. Then I go to the playground with my friends, and we play football there.\nAfter lunch, we have a History lesson. The History teacher tells us many interesting things.\nAfter school, my friends and I usually go for a walk. I come home very late, and my mother is very angry.", "id": "middle5791.txt"}
