And the Post Hotel is clean and not expensive. It is opened by a local family. From the hotel you can see the whole village, the forests and the mountains. Temperatures in summer are usually 20degC to 25degC in the daytime, but much cooler by evening.\nEnjoy Thailand\nWhen you visit Bangkok in Thailand, don't miss the early morning river boat trip to the Floating  Market outside the city. There you will find many kinds of fruits and vegetables. And you can pay for them when you sit in your boat. Don't forget your hat: the sun can be strong and it may be as hot as 40degC at noon.\nVisit Hawaii!\nMaybe the most beautiful place in  Hawaii is Kauai. You can visit its long, sandy beaches in the south and west of the island, and mountains and forests in the north, but don't be surprised if it rains in the centre of the island. Daytime temperatures there are usually around 24degC to 26degC by the sea, and only a little cooler by late evening.", "id": "middle1570.txt"}
