Because according to a report by Xinhna News Agency,students waste twice as much food as the national average .\nThe campaign on campus food waste is receiving attention across the country.\n\"The aim of the campaign is not only to encourage students to finish their food. We hope it can also encourage students to choose a more environment-friendly and healthy lifestyle,\" said Tao Siliang, secretary of the Youth League Committee at Shanghai University.\nBut some school food is poorly prepared, so students do not like to finish it all. Some schools have taken notice of this and they are taking measures to improve it.\n\"I'm glad that we've reduced food waste since the 'eat-up' campaign began. But if we call on students to waste less food, we should also improve the service and food standard on campuses.\" said Tao.", "id": "middle1926.txt"}
