Mark is one of them. The difference between Mark and other climbers is that he lost both his legs when climbing. New Zealand's highest mountain, Mount Cook. He was caught in a big ice hole and he had to have his legs cut below the knees after he was saved. But that couldn't make Mark lose heart, who has become the first person with man-made legs to reach the top of Mount Everest.\nFrom the top of the world's highest mountain, Mark called his wife to say he made it. His wife, Anne got the phone when she was sleeping. She couldn't hear him clearly on the phone. She was unable to say when he reached the top but thought it was around mid-day. She also said his \"legs\" didn't work well sometimes, so her husband was carrying a spare leg and repair tools.\nMark used to be a mountain guide before his accident. He said it was not important that no one like him had ever reached the 8850-meter mountain.\n\"I'm not doing this to be the first.
