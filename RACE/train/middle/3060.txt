Many years later, I was still working on the school bus. There are so many good reasons. Firstly, the talk brought me different kinds of information. I also got to hear all the family secrets of the newcomers. I have a toy bear who was a great comforter  for the little ones. The kids got to look after him on the trip to school and he waited patiently for _ to get on for the trip home.\nOur bus would often pass a place where we could see some alpacas   in front of a farm house. Little Michael would cry excitedly from the seat, \"Look, Miss! Look at the camels!\" He used to put his head out of the bus window. When I warned him that a little insect would come into his nose if he wasn't careful, he smartly gave up the habit.\nI remember a little girl got on the bus one morning 5 years ago and sobbed  all the way to school.
