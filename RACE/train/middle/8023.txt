I'm a boy of 8 and I have a funny dentist. His name is Dr. Smileyface. I don't think that's his real name, but that's what he tells all the children who come to see him.\nHe has a cool waiting room. It has video games and a big toy box. Dr. Smileyface always wears funny hats. Sometimes he has his face painted. He asks funny questions like \"Are you married yet?\" and \"Do you eat flowers to make your breath smell so sweet?\" That makes me laugh. One time, he told me this joke, \"What has lots of teeth but never goes to the dentist? A comb!\" When I laughed, he pulled my tooth. It didn't hurt at all! He also teaches me how to take care of my teeth in an interesting way. Before I leave, he always gives me a surprise. Last week he gave me a toy ship and I liked it very much.", "id": "middle8023.txt"}
