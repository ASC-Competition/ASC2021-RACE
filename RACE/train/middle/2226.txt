The World Cup is held every four years.\nTo remember the 2002 FIFA World Cup, children from different countries and more than 60 children from different Japanese schools came together and spent three weeks drawing a big picture called\"Dream   World Cup\"in Japan. The children drew animals, flowers and people playing soccer under bright blue sky. They wished each football team good luck by drawing the flags   of all countries that would take part in the World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The picture was put up in a park near a playground in Yokohama.\nAre you a football fan? The World Cup makes more and more people interested in football. Teenagers like playing and watching football.
