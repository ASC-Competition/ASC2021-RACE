The machine that makes these small bumps usually costs at least $2,000. It is called Braille writer. The American schoolboy, Shubham Banerjee, made a new Braille writer from a Lego tool that lets people create robots. Banerjee has called his new machine the Braigo - a combination   of the words Braille and Lego. It costs just $ 350. It works by changing electronic text into Braille and then printing it using a computer or mobile machine.\nBanerjee designed   his Braigo last year for a school science exhibition. Since then, he has caught the interest of Silicon Valley in the USA. The big technology company Intel spent money on Banerjee's machine last November, but they did not say how much money they put in. Banerjee also got $35, 000 from his father to help him start the project. His father works as a computer engineer   at Intel. He spoke about why he gave so much money to his son, saying:\"We as parents started to be interested more, thinking that he's on to something and this invention has to continue.\" Banerjee told the AP News: \"My dream would probably be having most of the blind people...using my Braigo.\"", "id": "middle5546.txt"}
