As he needed to move from Texas to New York if he got the job, he wanted to talk about the decision with someone before accepting it. But his parents had died. He remembered that his father had suggested he should turn to an old friend of his family if he needed advice.\nThe older man said, \"Go to New York and have the interview. But I want you to go on a train and I want you to get a private compartment . Don't take anything to write with, anything to listen to or anything to read, and don't talk to anybody except when you order the meal. Call me when you get to New York and I will tell you what to do next.\"\nAt first, Paul followed the advice closely. The trip took two days. As he had brought along nothing to do, he quickly became bored. He realized he was being forced into quite time - he could do nothing but think. About three hours outside New York City he broke the rules, asked for a pencil and paper and kept writing down the thoughts until the train arrived in New York.\nPaul called the family friend from the train station.\n\"Thank you, Uncle I know what you wanted. You wanted me to think. And now I know what to do.\"\"I guessed you could understand my idea, Paul,\" came the reply, \"Good luck.\"\nNow, years later, Paul runs a company in New York. And he always spends a couple of days being alone with no phone, no television and no people to think quietly.", "id": "middle7935.txt"}
