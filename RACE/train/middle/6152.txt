No,I am not.Watch it for yourself! Ads on fashion TV screens,radio programs,magazines,newspapers,and the streets.Whether they have realized it or not, women are surrounded by a sea of fashion. They are taught to think that without beautiful clothes they will grow old and lose their charm. so who dares to neglect  dressing up at the cost of their appearance and youth?\nBut I do not agree with the opinion that women have to show their beauty through their appearances. The richness of their minds proves to be more beautiful and attractive than their appearances. a woman who has experienced many troubles and may be called \"aunt\" or\"granny\" can still keep up her beauty if she has such excellent qualities as knowledge,ability,a kind heart,great courage, caring for others, etc.\nIn addition, old and young, beautiful and ugly are relative concepts .People who keep a young mind will never feel old.Interested in new things and eager to learn more,they keep up with the time. plainly-dressed women may have a type of beauty that is pure and real. Reading and learning is the best way to keep one youthful.Good books are rich soil which can feed the flower of one's heart and appearances.", "id": "middle6152.txt"}
