One morning he was standing in one of the big railway stations and waiting for travelers to ask him to help them with their luggage, when he saw a small man running toward the trains with a big bag in his hand.\nThe porter watched the man for a few seconds, and the man saw the porter.\nAt once the small man ran up the porter and said, \"Can I catch the 10:35 train to London, porter?\" He was breathing very fast, and he seemed worried.\nThe old porter looked at him for a moment and then said with a smile, \"Well, sir, I'd like to help you, but I can't answer your question because I don't know how fast you can run along rails. You see,\" he explained, \"the 10:35 train to London left five minutes ago.\"", "id": "middle2096.txt"}
