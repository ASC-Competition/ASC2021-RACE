He was so pleased with his mushrooms that he decided to share them. When their breakfast arrived the next day, each officer found some mushrooms on his plate.\n\"Try the dog with a piece first.\" Suggested one cautious officer who was afraid that the \" mushrooms\" might be poisonous.\nThe dog seemed to enjoy its mushrooms, and the officers then began to eat their meal, saying that the mushrooms tasted wonderful.\nAn hour later, however, there was great confusion when the gardener rushed in to announce that the dog was dead. Immediately, the officers jumped into their cars and rushed to the nearest hospital. Stomach pumps were used and the officers had a very unpleasant time getting rid of the remains of the mushrooms.\nWhen they returned to the mess, they sat down and started to discuss the symptoms of the mushroom poisoning.
