What did you write?\"\nThe man said, \"I only wrote the truth.I said what you said, but in a different way.\"\nWhat he had written was, \"Today is a beautiful day, but I can' t see it.\"\nDo you think the first sign and the second sign were saying the same thing?\nOf course both signs told people the boy was blind.But the first sign simply told people to help by putting some money in the hat.The second sign told people that they were able to enjoy the beautiful day, but the boy could not enjoy it because he was blind.\nThe first sign simply said the boy was blind, while the second sig told people they were so lucky that they were not blind.\nThere are at least two lessons we can learn from this simple story.\nThe first is:Treasure   what you have.Someone else has less.Try your best to help those who need your help.\nThe second is:Be creative.Think differently.There is always a better way.", "id": "middle8132.txt"}
