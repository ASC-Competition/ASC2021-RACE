I find out that the older he grows, the less we talk. I feel very worried and I really need help.\nMy first problem is about his hobbies, he seems to spend too much time on computer games. As soon as he gets home, he always turns on the computer, closes the door and locks others out. I am getting worried about him, especially when his English teacher told me he always fails(,) in the English exam.\nSecondly, it seems that he is crazy  about the new technology. However, to be honest, I don't have enough money and I can't _ all the things he wants.\nRecently, I have found that he seems to be always alone. I have never seen him talking to his friends on the phone or going out with anyone on weekends. That is the last problem I have.\nDo all the boys behave this way? What should I do to help him?\nA helpless mother", "id": "middle7632.txt"}
