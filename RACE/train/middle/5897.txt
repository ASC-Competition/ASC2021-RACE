Here are the directions   to the Sports Center.\nFrom our house, go right ahead on Main Avenue. Walk past the police station and the City Fountain. Then cross the bridge. At the other side of the river, turn right. The Sports Center is on your left. You can't miss it. The basketball game starts at 1:00 p.m. so don't be late. By the way, let's have some ice-cream after you finish playing. We can meet at Choco's Ice-Cream Shop. It's right around the corner from the Sports Center. Your game should be over at 3:00 p.m. so I'll meet you there 10 minutes later.\nHave fun!\nMom", "id": "middle5897.txt"}
