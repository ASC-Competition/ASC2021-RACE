And I have a brother called Mike.\nOne day, my brother called me and asked me for some advice. He was trying to decide between two job offers:\nJob 1 - The first job was your typical 40 hour a week \"office\" job.\nJob 2 - The second job was more of a career in the insurance industry , where he would start at the bottom, and after many years and many long hours eventually rise to the top (if he was good).\nThe second job did not pay as well as the first job (at the beginning), but the pay-off of the second job (in the future) was much greater than the first job. So which job should my brother take? Well the answer is...it depends.\nJust like the Cat was trying to tell Alice, which road you take depends a great deal on where you want to end up.\nBegin with the End in Mind\nI asked my brother what was his life's purpose. He said his purpose was to \"teach,\" but he wanted to make a lot of money first. I told my brother to forget about the money, and I advised him to focus on his purpose. I then asked him which job best supported his end result of \"teaching.\" He said the first job best supported his goal because he would only have to work 40 hours a week, which would give him spare time to teach. He continued on to say, \"but if I take job number two, I can work hard and make more money, then I can retire early and \"teach\" later in life.\" I again advised him to \"focus\" on his purpose, not money. Things don't end wrong, they begin wrong!\nYou Can't Ride Two Horses Well\nIt would be very difficult to have a successful teaching career while you're working 70-80 hours a week in the insurance business; no one can ride two horses well. As they say, you can do anything, but not everything. I advised him to get started today by choosing the job that best supported that decision.\nTomorrow Never Comes\nMy brother was thinking that he could always start teaching later in life, but the reality is, tomorrow never comes. Unless you decide right now to follow your feelings, they will probably never be completed. You only live once, don't go to the end of your life with one regret.\nThe Money Will Come\nMy brother seemed to be overly concerned with making money. I told him not to be anxious about making money. You will always have greater money when you're doing what you love.\nIn a word, whenever you're at a cross-road, be sure to make the decision that best supports the goal of your life. If you do, then you will be well on your way.", "id": "middle8.txt"}
