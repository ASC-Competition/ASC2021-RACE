Though she is very successful, she says that she finds it harder every year in balance   her business with her family life. She sometimes feels that her two children know more about their baby---sitter than they do about her.\nMolly employs   around eighty people in her factory and warehouse, and ten others in her two new fashion stores, but her newest employee is the most important one for her. After years of worrying about her business more than her family, she has decided to make Sally Pamonte new general manager in her company. Molly will still _ decision- making, and she's going to stay in touch with the people who work for her, but Sally is going to look after day-to-day running of the business so that Molly can spend more time with the kids.\nThe new arrangement   is going to start on Monday, and both of them are already excited about it. Sally says, \"I'm very nervous, actually, but I'm sure Molly will help me a lot in the early days, even though I hope she feels she can trust me not to make too many mistakes.\"\nMolly, on the other hand, seems quite relaxed about the whole thing. \"I know that Sally's going to be a very nice manager.\" she says, \"She's only been here a couple of days and she's already shown me how to work out a few problems we were having. The best thing though is that I feel a hundred times happier than I've been in years. I mean, I honestly can't remember the last time I felt as relaxed as this, and my kids are really excited about my being at home more. To be honest, I wish I had made this decision years ago.\"", "id": "middle5130.txt"}
