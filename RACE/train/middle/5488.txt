Nearly 50% of students say they are worried about robbery  on the way to and from school. Now in main big cities in China some schools have taught an unusual lesson: self-protection. Students like this lesson because there are no exams or boring classes. And they can learn how to save lives and know how to stop danger before it really happens.\nChen Haoyu, a teacher at BeijingNo.25 Middle School, gibes young students advice on how to deal with danger.\nIf you are in a traffic accident: If a car hits you, you should remember the car number. If it is a bike, try to call your parents before you let the rider go. This is because you don`t know how seriously you are hurt.\nIf it is raining hard and there is lightning:Don`t stay in high places and stay away from trees.\nWhen there is a fire :Get away as fast as you can .Put wet things on your body and try to find an exit. Do not take the lift.\nIf someone is drowning: If you can`t swim ,don`t get into the water. Cry out for help.\nRemember that danger is never as far away as you think. Take care of yourself at all times!\n,,", "id": "middle5488.txt"}
