Every day the old man went to the mountain and collected firewood, while the old woman went to the river and did the washing.\nOne day, she was doing the washing when a big peach   came floating   down the river towards her. As it was a big and juicy-looking fruit, she thought that her husband would be glad to eat it, so she took it home. When the old man came back for lunch and saw the nice peach, he was really happy. The old woman cut the big peach open with a knife! What a surprise! A lovely little boy was in the peach. The old man and woman had no children, so they were really grateful the gods   sent them a boy in this peach. Since he was born in a peach they decided to call him Momotaro which means \"peach-boy\". The old woman cooked a meal for the little boy who ate as much as he could. The more he ate, the more he grew. Soon he became a tall and strong boy.\nDay after day, all Momotaro did was sleep and eat. In the village the other boys went to the mountain and picked firewood while Monotaro was the only one doing nothing. This worried the old man and the old woman. The boys then invited him, \"Momotaro, would you come with us? We're going to collect fire wood.\" But he answered, \"I don't have a basket, so I can't go with you\", and went back to sleep. On hearing this, the old woman got angry with Momotaro for being so lazy, so the next day he went to collect firewood with the other boys.", "id": "middle3276.txt"}
