Here, three of the studetns tell us what they plan to do after the big exam.\nLi Junzhe, 15, Huaihua, Hunan Province    My friends and I will travel to Beijing right after the exam. We planned to go by ourselves but were turned down by our parents. They said we were too young to travel alone. They said they would go with us. I'm okay with it because I've already traveled by myself.\nZhu Hangian, 15, Dexing, Jiangxi Province   What am I going to do this summer? Of course I'll go to see the Great Wall! But before that, I will watch movies. Because of the big exam, I haven't seen any movies for a long time. I will watch whatever is in the cinema! As for the Great Wall, I can't wait to see the beautiful views.\nDong Xu, 14, Dalian, Liaoning Province  I will, no doubt, play computer games for days after the big exam.
