Since then, they've been springing up around the country. Today, Chinese food is one of the top choices for hungry Englishmen.\nBut since coming to China, I've found some differences. Much of the Chinese food in Britain is influenced by western tastes. For example, dishes are not hot and had fewer kinds. It's difficult to find the hot food of Yunnan food in Britain. The most popular Chinese dishes in Britain are chou mein, egg-fried rice and spring rolls. Also, meat dishes are always sweet and sour.\nThe Chinese food in Britain not only gives a different taste.
