At 8: 00 I have math. It is not fun. The teacher says it is useful, but I think it is difficult. Then at 9: 00 I have science. It is difficult but interesting. At 10: 00 I have history. After that I have P. E. at 11: 00. It's easy and fun. Lunch is from 12: 00 to 1: 00, and after that we have Chinese. It is my favourite subject. Our Chinese teacher, Mr. Wang, is great fun. My classes finish at 1: 50, but after that I have an art lesson for two hours. It is really relaxing!\nHow about you? When are your classes? What is your favourite subject?\nYour friend,\nYu Mei", "id": "middle3768.txt"}
