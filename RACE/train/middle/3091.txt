You might even need to leave your home right away. So you are supposed to plan for the bad situations before the disaster comes. Here are some suggestions:\nFirst, have a family meeting. Plan a way to get your family members together if they can't find each other after the disaster. Choose two places for everyone to go to if it isn't safe to return home. The first should be near your house. You can go there in an emergency  like a fire. The second meeting place should be outside your neighborhood.\nNext, choose a person outside your area who can help your family get in touch with each other. After a disaster, it is often easier to communicate over a long-distance call than a local one. The person can pass messages between your family members.\nThen, get a family disaster _ ready. It should include things your family needs. It can help you survive   at least for three days like bread, water, medicine and things like that. Put them in a bag so you can carry it if you leave in a hurry. When doing it, remember that different people have different needs.  Include special things necessary for elderly or young members of your family.\nFinally, practice your emergency plan, and update   it as necessary.\nYou may not be able to stop disasters, but with a little planning you can be helped.", "id": "middle3091.txt"}
