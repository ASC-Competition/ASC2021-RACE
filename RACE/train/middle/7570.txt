So, they can tell you if something is moving but they don't necessarily know if it's a human being or, ah, if it's your kids --they don't know the difference, so they will warn you all the time. \"\nWhen family members enter a home,  the new camera \"recognizes\" ( )  them and sends information to the owner's smartphone.
