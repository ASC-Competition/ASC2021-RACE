He gave me almost everything I wanted. Whenever I quarreled with my mother, I would turn to my father for comfort. He was everything to me.\nTime flies like a bird. As I got older, I became silent and found it hard to start a conversation with my father. The gap  between us began to grow. He had done so much for me but I always took it for granted .\nLast time our school gave us two days off, and daddy gave me a ride home on his motorbike. I was tired and fell asleep on his back. Later my mother said he was very happy because it had been a long time since we got close last. Suddenly I felt a little shamed. I realized that I had paid no attention to him a lot during the last few years.\nThe next day I stayed in bed and when daddy tried to wake me up to have breakfast, I pretended  that I couldn't hear him. At last he brought a bowl of noodles to my bed, and said, \"Come on, dear, have your breakfast and then continue your dream.\" I got so angry with him for troubling my sleep that I shouted, \" _ .\"\nAs I said this, I sat up quickly, and the bowl of noodles broke on the floor. Hearing the noise, mum came in and shouted at me, \"What do you think your father is? Who else treats you as well as he does?\"\nI was shocked and didn't know what to say. Finally I rushed with tears all over my face. I went to the pool where I used to go fishing with daddy. A few minutes later, I heard the sound of daddy's motorbike. He was looking for me worriedly, but he didn't notice me as I was sitting behind a tall brush.\nI didn't return home until 10 a.m.. The moment my parents saw me, they rushed to me. Mum hugged me tightly and daddy looked at me with worry in his eyes. \"Are you hungry, dear?\" he said at last. Before I could say anything, he had gone off on his motorbike to buy food for me.", "id": "middle454.txt"}
