I'd like to invite you to come and join us. I remember you told me that you liked travelling. We'll visit many places of interest. Such as the Great Wall, the Palace Museum and the Summer Palace. If it doesn't rain, we'' also go camping at the foot of the Great Wall. We'll stay at the Beijing Holidday Village. During these days, we'll have parties. At the parties, the students will sing, dance and play games together. Would you please write back to let me know if you come? We need to buy the train tickets ahead of time .\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.\nYours,\nLin Yun", "id": "middle5765.txt"}
