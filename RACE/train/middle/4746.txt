For 8 years I have learned English in the way everybody else did--by going to English classes. It was useless. I did everything that the teachers told me to do. But I didn't get any results. I mean, I was always one of the best students in class. However, it took me a long time to read English texts. I made lots of mistakes when writing, and my pronunciation was bad, and I could only speak English very slowly. After my eight years of studying hard, these were the results.\nIn 2003, I went to the best high school in Wroclaw. It was a special school with a lot of English classes. I owe  a lot to the people I met there, both students and teachers. My first two years in high school were very important for my English. My English teacher, Mr Janusz Laskosz, gave me a lot of good advice, especially on pronunciation and vocabulary. My talented friends, Wojtek and Michael Ryszard, who are my partners now, were both fantastic English learners. What's more, every time I heard them speak, they seemed to have a bigger vocabulary . I wanted to be as good as them, so I studied harder. And my English improved. Wojtek and Michael also introduced me to SuperMemo, which has been very important in my life. And, of course, I could discuss the English language with them, which was a great thing.", "id": "middle4746.txt"}
