One was a beautiful living room door, and the other was just a normal bathroom door.\nThere were some naughty children in the house, and they always kicked  the door. The living room door was always very angry about it and hated the children. The bathroom door didn't care too much when the children kicked him. Instead, he tried to comfort the living room door. He said, \"Don't worry. It's normal. They're children, and they'll grow up soon. Before long, things will be better.\"\nOne day, the living door finally lost his temper . A child kicked him, and he broke at once. The owner of the house got very angry and told the children to be careful next time. This made the living door happy. However, the owner didn't repair him; he threw him into a landfill  instead. At the same time, the bathroom door took the place of the living room door. And the children treated him with greater care.\nThe living room door realized his mistake. He shouldn't treat young children like that. He should learn to forgive  others. The happiness from revenge  will never last for long.", "id": "middle7536.txt"}
