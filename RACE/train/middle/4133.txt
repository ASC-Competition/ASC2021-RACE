Their father is a taxi driver and he is busy all the time. He goes out early in the morning, but comes back when his children are sleeping in bed. He makes a lot of money but he doesn't talk with them about their study. The two children study in the same class. Jenny works hard at her lessons, but her brother likes nothing but playing. He is not good at writing compositions  .\nOne day Mrs. Cook told her class to write a composition \"My Mother\". After supper Jenny wrote one in her exercise book and then went to help her mother to do some housework. But Henry went to play football. When night fell, he came back to watch TV until the TV play was over. And he took off his clothes and went to bed, he remembered the composition and had to go to the sitting room again. But he didn't know how to write it. He thought hard and at last he found a way. He found Jenny's schoolbag and brought out her exercise book and copied   her composition.\nTwo days later Mrs. Cook asked Henry, \"Can you tell me why your composition is the same as Jenny's?\" \"Yes, I can, madam,\" answered Henry. \"We have the same mother. \"", "id": "middle4133.txt"}
