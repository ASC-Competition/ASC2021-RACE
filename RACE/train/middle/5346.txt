They are Fly, a dog, and Huahua, a cat.\nFly is brown and grey. He is naughty . He sometimes steals  food in the kitchen.Once, when there was nobody at home, Fly pulled   a piece of meat off the table. But he was not careful enough. The plate also fell to the floor. When I got home, I saw the broken plate all over the floor, so I became very angry. Fly was so afraid that he went back to his bed at once.\nHuahua is a white and yellow cat. She is not beautiful but she is very lovely. Every night at weekends, Huahua sleeps on my bed. When she sleeps, she always snores. It is very funny.\nHuahua is also naughty. Whenever she does something bad and my grandma tries to catch her, she runs away quickly and hides quietly under the bed.\nFly and Huahua love to play games with me and I like them very much.", "id": "middle5346.txt"}
