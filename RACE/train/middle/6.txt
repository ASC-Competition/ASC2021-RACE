They were friends. One mouse lived in the country; the other mouse lived in the city. After many years the Country mouse saw the City mouse; he said, \"Do come and see me at my house in the country.\" So the City mouse went. The City mouse said, \"This food is not good, and your house is not good. Why do you live in a hole in the field? You should come and live in the city. You would live in a nice house made of stone. You would have nice food to eat. You must come and see me at my house in the city.\"\nThe Country mouse went to the house of the City mouse. It was a very good house. Nice food was set ready for them to eat. But just as they began to eat they heard a great noise. The City mouse cried, \"Run! Run! The cat is coming!\" They ran away quickly and hid.\nAfter some time they came out. When they came out, the Country mouse said, \"I do not like living in the city. I like living in my hole in the field. For it is nicer to be poor and happy, than to be rich and afraid.\"", "id": "middle6.txt"}
