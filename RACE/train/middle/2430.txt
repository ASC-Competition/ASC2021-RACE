They want to answer the question. The general asks the first man to speak. The man is younger than the other three, and he's not strong. He says, \"My gun  is the strongest. It can kill anyone.\"  \"Thank you. Next, please.\" The second man is very strong. He says, \"I don't think so. Soldiers use guns. So the soldier is the strongest.\" The third man says, \"Soldiers use guns, but our general gives orders. So I think our general is the strongest.\" The fourth man is the oldest. He says, \"Love is the strongest. For love, people don't use guns.\" The general says nothing. He takes out a medal and gives it to him.", "id": "middle2430.txt"}
