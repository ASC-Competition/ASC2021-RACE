Here is a 5R rule for us:\n1.  Reduce\nIf you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste\n2.  Reuse\nYou should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters.\n3.  Recycle\nBottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted   and the melted things are made for new coke cans.\n4.  Recover\nWhen you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples. You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food.\n5.  Repair\nIf one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away. If you want to change for better ones, It is better for you to sell the old things or give them to other people who can use them after doing some repair. It is true that North America is a \"throw-away\" society . But the time has come to change our way of life so that we can protect our environment. Every one of us should try our best.", "id": "middle258.txt"}
