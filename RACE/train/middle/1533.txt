But do you know there are people called \"ABC\"? You may like eating bananas. But do you know there are people called \"banana persons\"? If you don't know, I will tell you. They are Chinese people like you and me, but they aren't in China.Why do people call them like that?\n\"ABC\" means American-born Chinese. An \"ABC\" is a Chinese,\nbut was born in the United States. Sometimes, people also call them\n\"banana persons\". A banana is yellow outside and white inside. So when\na person is a banana, he or she is white (American) inside and yellow (Chinese)\noutside.\nThey are born in America and they live in America for a long time. Even\ntheir nationality  is American. So they think like Americans and do things\nlike Americans. But they still have Chinese blood . Their parents, grandparents\nor even great-grandparents were from China.They all have black eyes and black hair.\nSo they look like us Chinese people. For example, we all know the famous scientist\nC.N.Yang. He is an \"ABC\" and he is a \"banana person\". We like him, although \nhis nationality isn't Chinese.", "id": "middle1533.txt"}
