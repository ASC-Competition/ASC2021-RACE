The girls were talking about what they were going to wear.\n\"I'm going to wear a black dress, so everybody will notice me,\" said Emily. \"How about you, Linda?\"\n\"I'm not sure. Maybe jeans, an old shirt, and a hat. People will notice me more than you!\" Linda said.\n\"What are we going to do about the boys?\" asked Jane. \"Do you remember the last school party, last year? They just stood there, and we girls had to dance by ourselves!\"\n\"I hear that some of the boys learned how to dance this summer. Maybe it'll be better\nthis time,\" said Mary.\nThe party was held on Friday evening. Groups of students arrived. The music began. The girls stood in a line on one side, and the boys on another side. Mr. Green, their teacher, tried to get them together, but failed. After a while, Tim said, \"I don't want to stand here the whole time. The party is only for two hours. It'll be over soon.\" He started to dance. All the others watched him. Then David asked Emily if she wanted to dance. Then Jack and Linda. Then, all began to dance. Soon there were more dancers than watchers.", "id": "middle757.txt"}
