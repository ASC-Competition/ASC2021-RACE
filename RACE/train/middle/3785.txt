But in May this year, at Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Center. Many visitors were attracted by a 3D printer.\nThe machine looks similar to an ordinary printer and can print a \"statue\" in about 90 minutes after scanning anything, including a person.\nThe printer prints layer by layer. For example, if we want to print a 30-cm-tall statue, the computer will calculate* the layers and print 460 layers in total*. It can also print people and clothes. You can stand for scanning for just about three minutes, and a statue will be finished about two hours. The cost for a statue of a man is about 1000yuan. The printer, which costs about 500,000yuan, is from the USA.\n\"We want to introduce this technology to people, and find more chances here.\" said an engineer, \"There is a company in USA that offers 3D printing services to people. Many people come to design their own thing. It is very cool. We hope that the printer will encourage more Chinese people to be more creative.\"", "id": "middle3785.txt"}
