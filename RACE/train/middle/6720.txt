I decided to take my son Brain there for a week, hoping to educate  him.\nBefore getting out, I told Brain this trip would be tiring and hard. For the first two days, he said almost nothing. Then on the third day, when we were climbing over high rocky mountains , he turned to me and smiled, \"Really hard.\"\nAfter that, a five-year-old girl, wearing a too large dress and broken shoes, followed Brain around. Later he said, \"I wish I could speak French.\" I was surprised that this was from a boy who always hated French classes.\nHowever, the moment that really reached my heart _ in a village in the mountains. I was interviewing  a woman villager for an article. By working hard, she learned to read and write and became one of the leaders of the village.\nLearning her story, Brain was greatly touched. His eyes were wet and there was love and respect  on his face. He finally understood the importance of my work. When leaving for home, Brain even offered to stay in as a volunteer. This trip was very meaningful.", "id": "middle6720.txt"}
