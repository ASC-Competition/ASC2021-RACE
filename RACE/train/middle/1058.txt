However, with the fast development of mobile phones, it has lost its place in people's everyday life. In order to save their loved red phone boxes, people have come up with many ideas, for example, to turn them into toilets or art houses.\nIn a village in Somerset, a place in South West England, villagers have found a new way to save their red phone box. They turned it into a mini library to deal with the shortage of libraries in their area. The idea was given by a local villager, Janet Fisher, who lives opposite the phone box. Villagers got together to set up the book box. Over 100 books and a lot of movies and music CDs are available at this mini library. The books are of different kinds, including from cooking books to the classics and children's books. People can put the books that they have read inside the phone box, and take away the books that they'd like to read. The books are always changing. There is a regular check on the books to keep the phone box collection fresh.\nAnyone is free to come to read books there. The phone box library is open every day around the clock and is lit (the past form of \"light\") at night.  \" It's very pleasing that the red phone box has been saved. More importantly, it can continue providing a service for us,\" said one of the villagers.", "id": "middle1058.txt"}
