Our car was full of flowers inside! On the way home we had to stop at traffic lights, and there my wife saw the bookshelf.\nIt stood outside a furniture  shop.\" Buy it,\" she said at once.\"We'll carry it home on the roof-rack . I've always wanted one like that.\" What should I do?Ten minutes later I was twenty dollars poorer,and the bookshelf was tied onto the roof-rack. It was tall and narrow, quite heavy too.As it was getting darker, I drove slowly.Other drivers seemed more polite than usual that evening. The police evenstopped teaffic to let us through. Carrying furniture was a good idea.\nAfter some time my wife said,\"There's a long line of cars behind. Why don't they overtake \" Just at that time a police car did overtake. The two officers inside looked at us seriously when they went past.But then, with a kind smile they asked us to follow their car through the busy traffic. The police car stopped at our village church .One of the officers came to me.\n\"Right, sir!\"he said,\"Do you need any more help now?\" I didn't quite understand. \"Thanks, officer,\" I said. \"You've been very kind. I live just down the road.\"\nHe was looking at our things, first at the flowers, then at the bookshelf. \"Well, well,\" he said and laughed. \"It's a bookshelf you've got there! We thought it was... er ..., something else.\" My wife began to laugh. Suddenly i understood why the police drove here. I smiled at the officer. \"Yes, it's a bookshelf, but thanks again.\" I drove home as fast as i could.", "id": "middle3960.txt"}
