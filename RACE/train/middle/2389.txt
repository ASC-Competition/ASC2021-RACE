It looks like a hot and bright plate. But it is a ball. It is much bigger and hotter than any fire. And it is much brighter than all the lights in the world.\nThe sun is a star but it looks much bigger and brighter than any other star. Many stars are much bigger than the sun. The sun is much nearer to us, so it looks much bigger.\nAt night we can see the moon and many stars. The moon is a round ball. It is much smaller than the stars. The stars are much farther away from us; so thy look much smaller than the moon. The moon has no light of its own. When the sun shines on it, it looks bright. When the moon is full.
