I am 15 years old. I am pretty healthy. I like doing all kinds of sports, such as football, basketball, running and swimming. Every morning, I get up early and do exercise. I play basketball on Wednesdays and Saturdays with my friends every week. I do my homework every day. I like watching TV, but I can't watch it every day on school nights. I only watch it on Saturday evening. I am neither fat nor thin. My eating habits are very good. I try to eat a little meat and lots of vegetables and fruit. And I never eat junk food.\nDo you know me? I'm Zhao Hui, a 14-year-old student. I am a little fat. I like eating meat. I eat meat three or four times a week. I especially like eating junk food. I want to eat it every day, but my parents don't allow me to eat it every day. I only eat it once or twice a week. I don't like exercise at all. Sometimes, I swim with my friends because I like it. I know exercise is good for my health. From now on, I have to exercise every day.", "id": "middle4380.txt"}
