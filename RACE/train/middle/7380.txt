One night, his elder son had a stomachache  . Thinking it was only some common intestinal  disorders, neither Jack nor his wife took it seriously. But the boy died suddenly that night.\nKnowing the death could have been avoided if he had only realized the seriousness of the situation, Jack always felt guilty. His wife left him a short time later, leaving him alone with his six-year-old younger son. The hurt and pain of the two situations were more than that Jack could stand, so he turned to alcohol   for help. Later, Jack began to lose everything he had --- his land, house, etc. Finally Jack died alone in a small bar. Hearing of Jack's death, I thought, \"What a totally wasted life! What a complete failure!\"\nAs time went by, I knew Jack's younger son who grew into an adult, Ernie. He is one of the kindest and most loving men I have ever known. I saw the love between Ernie and his children, thinking that kindness and caring had to come from somewhere. One day, I asked him what his father had done so that he became such a special person. Ernie said quietly, \"As a child until I left home at 18, Jack came into my room every night, gave me a kiss and said, 'love you, son'.\"", "id": "middle7380.txt"}
