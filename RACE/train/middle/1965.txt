My mum always found ways to make leftovers  taste good. I went to YiLan to learn about some of their special food. As I was there, I learned about the food and the history of the area. I learned that they don't waste food, either, and they use leftovers!\nMany years ago, there was not enough food for everyone. People learned to cook and eat almost everything. They had to think of ways to make special dishes. One of these dishes is kao zha.It  made  with leftovers like\nmeat, soup, oil and fat. That might not sound very good, but it does taste good.\nToday, kao zha is a special dish at big banquets  .  Another famous dish is called zao bing.\nIt's made with fruit, meat and other things. I really liked it! But I didn't want to eat too much.  It has a\nlot of fat in it. I smelled something burning and I saw smoke, so I found another special food of the YiLan area  duck  meat. The duck meat is put in a big oven   to cook it. Smoke keeps the meat fresh.   I don't\nusually eat meat, but this duck meat was delicious! It tasted sweet. YiLan is a great place with delicious food. I hope I can come back again!", "id": "middle1965.txt"}
