Some families go to fast food restaurants. But in the past people went to diners. Do you want to know the story of the first American diner?\nIn 1872, a man named Walter Scott had the first \"diner\". It was not really a diner. It was only a simple food cart . People on the street walked up to the cart to buy food. The cart served late-night workers who wanted a cup of coffee and a late night meal. The meal was a sandwich or boiled eggs. In 1887, Samuel Messer Jones built the first big enough diner to allow customers to come inside. However, they had no chairs to sit down. Three years later, people built diners with counters and stools and people sat down while they were eating.\nBefore long, many diners stayed open around the clock. In other words, people were able to eat in a diner at any time. Diners changed in other ways, too. The earliest menu which only included sandwiches and coffee became bigger. Soup and dishes were added to the menu, and a breakfast menu appeared, too. In addition, diners were no longer carts on wheels.\nDiners today are usually buildings with large windows, shining counters and stools, tables and chairs, where people can eat all three meals.", "id": "middle6564.txt"}
