Firstly, Jay bought a plane ticket and took a trip to Columbus, Ohio, USA, thinking that he would start by working his way across the USA from East to West.\nOn his first day he was inside a church taking photos when he noticed a golden telephone on the wall with a sign that read \"$10,000 per call\".\nJay was _ so he asked a priest   what the telephone was used for.\nThe priest told him that it was a direct   line to heaven  and that for $10,000 you could talk to God. Jay thanked the priest and went along his way.\nNext stop was in Des Moines, and there at a very large church, he saw the same looking golden telephone with the same sign under it. A nearby nun told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for $10,000 he could talk to God.\nJay decided to travel to Australia to see if they had a similar phone. He arrived at Western Australia, and again, in the church he entered, there was the same looking golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read \"40 cents per call.\"\nSomewhat surprised, Jay asked the priest about the sign. 'Father Brian, I travelled all over the world and I saw this same golden telephone in many churches. I know it is a direct line to Heaven, but in all of them price was $10,000 per call. Why is it so cheap here?'\nFather Brian smiled and answered, 'My son, you're in Australia now - this is Heaven, so it's only a local call.'", "id": "middle2500.txt"}
