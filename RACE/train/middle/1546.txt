Choose ideas from the list or come up with a few of your own.\n* Plant flowers, grass or trees.\n*Whenever you visit a park or beach, take away what you bring there----keep rubbish in a bag until you can put it in a dustbin  .\n*Turn off the lights, TV sets when you leave the room. This saves  a lot of electricity.\n*Turn off the tap  when you brush your teeth. You can save some water by not letting it run. Also, use a glass cup instead of a paper cup because this saves paper.\n*Keep the doors and windows closed in winter to keep warm air in.\n*Give your old books and magazines to a library instead of throwing them away.\n*Give your old clothes to poor children you know instead of throwing them away.\n*Use both sides of paper.\n*Stop pouring  dirty water into the rivers or the lakes nearby  .\n*Encourage all your friends to do the same things you do to help protect the earth.\nYou don't have to wait until Earth Day to do these things. Make every day Earth Day.\nIf everyone makes a contribution  to protecting the environment, the world will become much more beautiful.", "id": "middle1546.txt"}
