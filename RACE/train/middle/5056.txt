She liked this home and planned to stay there for the rest of her life.\nOne day, the spider caught a little bug in her web. Just as the spider was about to eat him, the bug said: \"If you let me go, I will tell you something important that can save your life.\"\nThe spider thought for a little while and listened. \"You'd better get out of this cornfield,\" the little bug said. \"The harvest is coming!\"\n\"I think you are just telling me a story,\" the spider said with a smile.\n\"Oh no, it is true,\" the little bug said. \"All the stalks   will be knocked down, and the corn will be gathered up. You will be killed by the giant machines if you stay here.\"\n\"I don't believe you,\" the spider said as she ate the little bug for lunch.\nA few days later, the spider was laughing about the story the little bug had told her. She thought to herself: \"A harvest! What a silly idea. I have lived here all of my life, and nothing has ever disturbed   me.\"\nThe next day was a beautiful sunny day. The sky above was clear, and there was no wind at all. That afternoon, as the spider was about to take a nap  , she noticed some thick dusty clouds moving towards her. She could hear the noise of a great engine  , and she said to herself: \"I wonder what that could be?\"", "id": "middle5056.txt"}
