China's online community has gone crazy about the 1996-born girl, not because of her performance in the semifinal or her achievement, but because of her cheerful answer to her performance during an interview by CCTV.\nFinishing the 100 meter backstroke with 58.95 seconds, Fu, who thought it was 59 seconds, was quite surprised with the result. This was the first moment when she impressed Chinese audience with her surprising look and body language in front of the camera. The second time that the young swimmer amazed the audience was her honest and direct answer to a question raised by the reporter.\" We know that your body condition was not that good in the past year and it's not easy to have such a result. Do you think you are now as good as before?\" asked the reporter.\" It is my best score ever. I have worked for three months on the recovery. Only the ghost knows what I have come through,\" said Fu, \"It was so painstaking that sometimes I felt like I was  going to die.\"\nIn the interview, Fu used a phrase\" Hong Huang Zhi Li\"to describe the great efforts she has made in preparing for the competition, which soon became a popular word on the internet.", "id": "middle7797.txt"}
