You can do more of it in less time if you learn to read rapidly. Perhaps you have been told about some habits which keep a person from reading fast and have been strongly asked to break those which you might have.\nDo you still have any of these bad habits? Check yourself by answering \"yes\" or \"no\" to these questions.\n(1)Do you move your lips  when reading silently?\n(2)Do you point to words with your finger as you read?\n(3)Do you move your head from side to side as you read?\n(4)Do you read one word at a time?\nIf you answer \"yes\" to any of these questions, start at once to break the habit.If you move your lips, hold your fingers over them,or hold a piece of paper between your lips while you are reading. Then if your lips move, you will know it and can stop them.\nIf you point to words, hold the two sides of your book, one side with your left hand, the other side with your right hand. Then you won't have a free finger to use in pointing while reading. If you move your head, place your chin in one hand and hold your head still .\nIf you read no more than one or two three words at a time, you need to work very hard in learning to take in  more words at each glance  as your eyes travel across the lines of words.\nEven if you do rather fast now, you can learn to read even faster.As you probably have been\ntold, the fast reading is to take in whole groups of words as each glance. Read in thought groups and force your eyes along the lines of words as fast as you can make them go. Anyone who practices doing these things will be able to read faster", "id": "middle5799.txt"}
