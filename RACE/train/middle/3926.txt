Here is a story that tells about this common and natural human feeling.\nThe busiest woman in Labrador during one bitter cold Christmas not very long ago, was an Australian nurse named Kate Austen. But Nurse Austen was not too busy to write with a long, friendly letter for every gift of food or clothing received for poor villagers in the north of Australian. Among the gifts was a box of knittings   for children, knitted and sent by a woman in Toronto.\nNurse Austen, was busy, and not feeling too well that winter. She could have written just ordinary routine notes of acknowledgement. But that was not her way. She sat down and wrote the woman in Toronto a real letter telling all about the village, and the names of the children who were wearing the knitted gloves and caps, and what they said when they got them, and how they looked when they wore them. She wanted the woman who had knitted and sent all those lovely knittings \"to see how much happiness and warmth she had created.\" Not long after, she received the following answer from Canada.\nDear Miss Austen,\nYour letter made me happy. I did not expect such a full return, I am eighty years old, and I am blind. There is little I can do expect knit, and that is why I knit so many caps and sweaters scarves. For sixty years I have been making up missionary packages of such clothing or food or medicine or book as I could collect. But never before in all that time have I had a personal letter picturing the village and telling me who is wearing the clothing and what they said. I did not suppose that ever in my lifetime I should receive a letter like that. My God bless you.\nSincerely yours,                                                                  Laura N. Russell\n,.", "id": "middle3926.txt"}
