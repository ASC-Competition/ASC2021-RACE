She hated cabbage. She only sat there in silence with tears in her eyes.\n\"Shelly, my dear, why don't you eat a little? If not, your mum will shout at us.\"\nShelly didn't feel happy. \"OK, dad. I will eat, just a little.\" Then Shelly said, \"Dad, if I eat it all, will you give me what I want?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nSlowly she began to eat. It took her almost half an hour to finish all the food in the bowl. Then she came up to me and said, \"Dad, I want to have my hair cut off!\"\n\"Shelly, why don't you ask for something else? If we see your head like that, we'll feel very sad,\" I said.\n\"But Dad, you promised! Now you're going back on your words. \"\nI had to keep my promise. Shelly had all her hair cut off. She smiled.\nOn Monday morning, I took Shelly to school. Just when I arrived, a boy got out of a car and shouted, \"Shelly, please wait for me!\"\nGuess what? The boy had no hair, either.\n\"Sir, your daughter is great!\" a man got out of the car and said, \"This boy is my son, Harish. He has cancer. He lost his hair when he got ill. Shelly cut hers off so Harish felt less different. She is a special girl.\"\nI stood for a while, \"My little daughter, you teach me how selfless real love is!\"", "id": "middle3098.txt"}
