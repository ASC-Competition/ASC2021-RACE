Please help us!\"\nGuo Chuanjie, a famous scientist, received a letter from a Beijing primary school student. The student said that many Chinese kids have to take extra classes on weekends in order to enter key middle schools. The kid hoped more people would hear his voice with Guo's help.\nGuo is a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC, ). Last month the CPPCC members met in Beijing. They are from all walks of life - scientists, businesspeople, doctors, artists and athletes. They give proposals   on the country's important issues  to make our country better. For the Beijing student's letter, Guo read it in front of Yuan Guiren, China's Minister of Education  , during a CPPCC meeting.\nAccording to Xinhua, there were 5,762 proposals in all. Many of the proposals were about problems like housing prices, heavy traffic and food safety, which were related to people's daily lives. Some proposals were about teenagers. For example, singer Han Hong suggested that the government should deal with people who traffic  children.\nAs usual, proposals will be given to relative departments   after the meetings. For example, Guo's proposal was handed to the Ministry of Education. The departments will consider the proposals carefully and see if they can be carried out in the future.", "id": "middle2967.txt"}
