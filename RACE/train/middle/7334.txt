One afternoon I am coming home from a friend's house. It is just after four o'clock. I get quickly into the lift and press Button  12.\nThe lift starts to go up, but very slowly. And then, half way up, it suddenly  stops between two floors. I couldn't understand it. I press an all the buttons from 1 to 14. I call for help very loudly. But nobody answers.\nThen suddenly the lights go out, and I am alone in the dark. I start to cry and beat the walls of the lift. I cry and cry until I have no voice left. Then, I feel hopeless, and press all the buttons with my open hands. And all at the same time, there is a bell far away. It rings and rings. It is the fire alarm . I think the whole building is on fire. I say to the God quietly, \"Just get me out of here. I'll never be bad again.\"\nJust then, I realize the lift is moving very slowly. On the ground floor it stops, and the door opens. A man is standing there. \"How long have you been there? It is good that you press the alarm bell. But haven't you learned to read at your school? \" He points at a small piece of paper on the wall beside the lift. It says: \"Attention  : This lift will be stopped for repairs between 4 pm and 5 pm on Thursday, March 13.\"", "id": "middle7334.txt"}
