But as I chose add read, and chose add read again, it seemed that not a single card said what I really wanted to you.\nYou'll soon be 84 years old, Dad,and you and I will have had 56 Father's Days together. I didn't think that you were too old. But the sad thing happened last week. I watched as you turned at the corner in your car. I didn't realize at once that it was you because _ who was driving looked so elderly.\nFifty years ago this spring, we planted carrots together in a garden in Charles City, Iowa. This week, we'll plant carrots together again, perhaps for the last time but I hope not. I don't understand why planting carrots with you is so important to me. Well, I don't quite know how to tell you this, dad ... I don't like carrots.... but I like planting them with you.\nI guess what am trying to say, Dad, is what every son and daughter wants to say to their dad today. Praising a father on Father's Day is about more than a dad who brings home, money or shares a dinner. It's more about a dad deeply loving children who know everything and won't listen to anyone. It's about sharing. It's about loving someone more than words can say, and I wish that it would never end.\nLover,\nJenny", "id": "middle7092.txt"}
