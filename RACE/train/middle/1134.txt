He saw an extremely grand palace half way and the owner of the palace asked him to stay and live in the palace.\nThe man said, \"I have been working hard during my life and now I just want to eat and sleep without any work.\"\nThe owner of the palace said, \"If so, there is nowhere else better than here for you. There is plenty of seafood and delicacies   in my palace, and you can eat whatever you like without anyone stopping you. And nothing needs to be done by you.\" Then, the man settled down   in the palace.\nAt the beginning, the man felt very happy at the cycle of eating and sleeping. But gradually, he felt a bit lonely and void. So he went to the palace owner and said, \"It is very bored to live by just eating and sleeping every day. Now I show no interest in this kind of life any more. Could you help me find a job?\"\nThe owner replied, \"Sorry, there is no job here at all.\"\nAfter another several months, the man could not go on with the life and went to the palace owner again, \"I really can not stand this kind of life any more. If you do not offer me a job, I would prefer to go to hell instead of living here.\"\nThe owner of the palace smiled contemptuously  , \"Do you think it is heaven here? It is actually hell!\"\n,.
