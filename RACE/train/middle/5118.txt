Words have the power to cheer us up or let us down. It doesn't matter if the words come from someone else or ourselves -- the positive and negative   influences are just as lasting.\nWe all talk to ourselves sometimes. We're usually too shy to admit  it, though. In fact, we really shouldn't be because more and more scientists believe talking to ourselves out loud is a healthy habit.\nThis \"self-talk\" helps us make ourselves active, remember things, solve problems, and calm ourselves down. It is said that as much as 77% of self-talk is likely to be negative. So in order to stay positive, we should only speak words of encouragement to ourselves. _ . The next time you finish a project, do well in a test, or finally clean your room, join me in saying \"Good job!\"\nOften, words come out of our mouths without us thinking about the influence they will have. But we should realize that our words cause certain influence in others. For example, when returning an item to a store, we might use warm, friendly language during the exchange. And the salesperson will probably answer in a similar manner. Otherwise you may get into trouble.\nWords have power because of their lasting influences. Many of us feel sorry for something we once said. And we remember unkind words said to us! Before speaking, we should always ask ourselves: Is it true? Is it loving? Is it needed? If what we want to say doesn't pass this test, then it's better left unsaid.\nWords have power: both positive and negative. Those around us receive encouragement when we speak positively. We can offer hope, build self-confidence and encourage others to do their best. Negative words destroy all those things. Will we use our words to hurt or to cure? The choice is ours.", "id": "middle5118.txt"}
