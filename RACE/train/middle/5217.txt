A man goes shopping because he needs something. All men simply walk into a shop and ask for what they want  If the shop has it, the salesman quickly finds it, and the business of trying it on continues at once. All being well, the deal can be and often is completed in less than five minutes.\nFor a man, small problems may begin when the shop does not have what he wants. Then, the salesman tries to sell the customer something else. \"I know this jacket is not the style you want, sir, but would you like to try it for size? It happens to be the color you mentioned.\" Few men have patience with this treatment, and the usual reply is, \"This is the right color and maybe the right size, but I should be wasting my time and yours by trying it on.\"\nHowever, a woman does so in the opposite way. Her shopping is not often based on(... ) need, and she is only \"having a look around\". She is always open to persuasion, really she believes in what the saleswoman tells her. She will try on any number of things. Most women have an excellent sense of value when they buy clothes. They are always on the lookout for the unexpected sale. Faced with a roomful of dresses, a woman may easily spend an hour going from one room to another, often going back over again, before choosing the dresses she wants to try on. It is always tiring, but obviously  enjoyable. Most dress shops provide chairs for the waiting husbands.\n,.", "id": "middle5217.txt"}
