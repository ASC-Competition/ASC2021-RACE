Just like the Internet was 10 years ago, blogging is popular with an underground culture, that is doing it for love and passion .\nBlogging is a way of collecting links  to webpages and sharing thoughts and ideas with people online. Blogs are basically online diaries which are created for sharing information and ideas.\nDominic, a fifth-grade student, writes: \"The blogs give us a chance to communicate between ourselves and encourage us to write more. When we publish on our blog, people across the whole world can reply by using the 'comments' link. In this way, they can ask questions or simply tell us what they like. We can then know if people like what we write and this will tell us where we can improve. By reading these comments, we can discover our weaknesses and our strengths. Blogging is a chance to exchange our opinions with the rest of the world rather than just people in our immediate environment.\"\nBlogging is sweeping the Internet. A recent report states that at least three million Americans have created blogs, with similar numbers being seen worldwide.\nTwo years ago, Andrew Sullivan decided to set up a Web page himself and used \"Blogger. com\" to publish some daily thoughts to a few hundred readers. He worked hard at the blog for months for no reward. But the result is that he is now reaching almost a quarter of a million readers a month and making a lot of money.\nThis, at least, is the idea: a publishing revolution  is coming. \"Blogger.com\"  could be  to words what Napster was to music--except this time, it'll really work.", "id": "middle5804.txt"}
