I'm writing to you in my school. It's a middle school. Our school is very nice. There are about 2000 students and 150 teachers in our school. There are three grades and in each grade there are ten classes. I'm in Class Two, Grade Seven. I go to school from Monday to Friday. There are five classes in the morning and two in the afternoon. We play games every afternoon after class. I like playing soccer very much. I often play it with my classmates.\nI have three good friends. One of them is Li Lei. He is a Chinese boy. He often helps me with my Chinese. I help him study English. The others are twins. They are Lucy and Lily. They come from England. We often sing and dance together. We are very happy!\nPlease write soon.\nYours,\nBen", "id": "middle6772.txt"}
