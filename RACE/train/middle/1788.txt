My 12-year-old daughter is in tears.\"I have so take a test tomorrow. I don't understand any of it,\" she cries out. After shouting and shutting her door, she calms down enough to go through her notes. The following dry I ask her how the test went and the just says \"OK,I got a nine\".\n\"Wow. well done!\" I say, before she finishes with \"But I never get a ten!\"\nAccording to James, this _ with getting top marks has been a bad development, which encourages people to think of education in terms of work and money. To test this, I asked my daughter why she was so worried about her tests. She looked at me as if I was thick. \"Well, if I don't get good grades, I won't be able to afford nice things like a car and stuff.\"\nI was quite surprised, because I don't consider myself a pushy parent. But James suggests and it leaves students feeling failures even if they are very bright. He points to the Danish system of education as a better model. Creating happy citizens who have good social skills is seen as more important than high achievements at school or the needs of business.\nFor me, I cannot remember the last time I had to work out the area of a circle, recite a Shakespeare poem or grammar rules, yet I have lived a happy life. What I really needed to learn at school was how to make polite conversations, or how to avoid getting into debt or how to develop good personality.\nThis is in fact similar to what Oliver James really has in mind. And he is looking for schools where students are encouraged to find and follow their own interests, something more like Tongjon. Tongjon has been developed in some Korean private schools. It is quite different from the more rigid system of learning things by heart that is used in Korea, and indeed in many other school systems around the world.\nAs the Russian poet Pushkin said,\" Inspiration is needed in geometry just as much as in poetry \",and inspiration does not come from endlessly revising for tests or getting worried about them .", "id": "middle1788.txt"}
