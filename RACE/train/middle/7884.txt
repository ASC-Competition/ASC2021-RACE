Like a planet, a comet has no light of its own. It shines from the sunlight it reflects  . Like the earth a comet goes around the sun, but on a much longer path than the earth travels.\nIf a comet isn't a star, what is it then?\nSome scientists think that a large part of a comet is water frozen   into pieces of ice and mixed with iron and rock dust and perhaps a few big pieces of rock. When sunshine melts   the ice in the comet, great clouds of gas go trailing after it. These clouds, together with the dust, form a long tail.\nMany people have seen a comet. However, no one knows how many comets there are. There may be millions of comets, but only a few come close enough for us to see.\nAn Englishman named Edmund Halley, who lived from 1656 to 1742, found out a lot about the paths that comets take through the sky. Some comets move out of our sight and never come back. Others keep coming back at regular times. A big comet that keeps coming back was named after Halley comet, because the last time it came close to the sun and the earth was in the year 1986. Then people all over the world were outside at night to look at it. You will probably be able to see Halley's comet when it comes near the earth again.\n,A, B, C, D,.", "id": "middle7884.txt"}
