The lion woke up. He was very angry and caught the mouse. \"I will eat you!\" the lion said angrily.\nThe mouse cried out,\"If you do not kill me, I would be happy to give you a reward .\"The lion laughed at the idea. He did not think a little mouse could help such a big strong animal like himself. But he still let the mouse go.\nAfter a few days, it happened. The lion was caught by hunters' net. He tried his best to leave, after half a day, but he still couldn't get out of the net. He was very sad, he thought he was dying. At that time the lion felt something nibbling(,) on the ropes. It was the mouse. Just before dark, the work was done. There was a hole in the net. The lion got free through the hole. He was very happy and thanked the mouse, \"My friend, you have saved me. I will never _ the power of small animals like you.\"\nFrom then on, the lion and the mouse became friends.", "id": "middle6532.txt"}
