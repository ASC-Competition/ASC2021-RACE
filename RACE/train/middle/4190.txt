She didn't listen to popular music or watch many movies, and she wasn't interested in nice clothes. When she got together with her friends, they wanted to listen to rock and pop music. When Tina asked  if  they would  like  to  try classical    music, they all looked at her strangely.\"Classical music  is  for old people, \" one of  her friends said. Tina was worried that something was wrong with her. She decided to talk to her father. As she entered his study  , her father could feel something was wrong.\n\"Dad, am I strange?\" she asked her father.\"Of course not, \" he answered. \"Why do you ask that?\" \"Because I don't like the same things as my classmates do. They want to listen to Mariah Carey's music. I like Yo Yo Ma's.\" \"I can understand, Tina,  it's all  right _ You don't have to copy   what other people do. Everybody has different tastes.
