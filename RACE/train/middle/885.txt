She worked very hard at her lessons. She was too busy to have a rest. At last, she became ill, and couldn't go to sleep. Every night, when she went to bed, she closed her eyes and tried to sleep. But the more she tried, the more she stayed _ .\nAfter a while she went to see a doctor, \"I just can't go to sleep at night. What should I do?\" \"I have a suggestion  ,\" said the doctor, \"Try counting numbers. By the time you reach one thousand, you will be asleep. I'm sure of it.\"\nThe next day the student returned to the doctor's office. \"Well,\" said the doctor, \"How are you today? Did you try my suggestion?\" The student still looked tired. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I tried counting one, two, three...up to one thousand. But when I reached five hundred and sixty-nine, I began to feel sleepy. I had to get up and drink some coffee so that   I could go on counting up to one thousand. But then I still couldn't fall asleep.\"\n,.", "id": "middle885.txt"}
