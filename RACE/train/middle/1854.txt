When they want something, they say\"Yes\", and when they don't, they say \"No\".If they want something different from what is given, they ask for it.  Here's an example : I arrive at someone's house and he or she gives me wine, but I don't want wine. Maybe I don't like it or maybe I just don't want it. I will say \"No thanks\". If everyone around me is drinking something, I would ask  for something else,\"No thanks. But I'll take a bit of tea if you have some.\" It's a polite way to ask something you really want. If I really want wine, I just say \"Yes, thank you\". Unless they happen know the Chinese customs(;), _ will not ask you again and again after you to eat or drink something.\n,,.
