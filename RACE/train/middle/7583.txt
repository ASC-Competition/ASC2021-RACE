Your stomach hurts and you have a headache. Some people might feel their hearts beating quickly while they are waiting for the test paper. A student with really strong test _ may even feel like he or she might be sick or throw up .\nSound familiar? You'll find that just about all people--adults and others--have some anxiety before a test. According to studies, proper anxiety can be helpful, keeping you sharp and focused and even helping you get good grades. But when you have so much anxiety or feel so sick that you can't do well in your studies or tests, that's bad for your studies or your body health.\nOf course, if you don't study for the test, you might be worried.

When you are preparing for a test and you get a handle on your test, you will be able to let your knowledge work well and get good grades.\nFor example, last Wednesday was the day of a big test at school.
