The third group took classes in drams . And the last group did no special activities at all.\nAt the end of the school year, the 132 children took an IQ test again. In all four groups, the average score went up. However, the piano players'IQs went up 7.0 points on average. The average increase for the other three groups was only 4.3 points.\nThe researchers say that the difference is small and it may not result in better grades for the piano players.
