He had left a message the night before, telling me that my show was to be cancelled. I called him several times, but each time his secretary told me that he was in a meeting and that he would call me later. So I waited and waited, but there was still no call. Three hours passing by, I became more and more impatient. I was certain that my agent didn't care about my work, and he didn't care about me. That thought beat me. I started to shout at the phone, \"Let me wait, will you? Who do you think you are?\"\nAt that time I didn't realize my wife was looking on. Without showing her surprise, she rushed in, took away the phone and pulled the lines out of the phone, and shouted at the phone, \"Yeah! Who do you think you are? Bad telephone! Bad telephone!\" And she swept it into the wastebasket.\nI stood watching her, speechless. What on earth...?\nShe stepped to the doorway and shouted at the rest of the house, \"Now hear this! All objects in this room - if you do anything to upset my husband, out you go!\"\nThen she turned to me, kissed me, and said quietly, \"Dear, you just have to learn how to take control.\" With that, she left the room.\nAfter watching a crazy woman rushing in and out, shouting at everything in sight, I noticed that something in my feelings had changed. I was laughing. How could I have trouble with that phone?\nHer unusual actions helped me realize I had been driven crazy by small things. Twenty minutes later my agent did call. I was able to listen to him and talk to him quietly.", "id": "middle7341.txt"}
