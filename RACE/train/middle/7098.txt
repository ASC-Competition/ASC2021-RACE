Vegetables that had been cooked crisply became very tender and soft. Fish that had been fried became soup. Her old shredded   potato turned into diced potato... Feeling strange, dad and I asked Mom the reason for the change. But all she said was, \"Just trying a different taste\". Then she was silent.\nBut it wasn't just her cooking way. Mom also change other habits. After dinner, instead of watching films on TV as usual, she would put on her newly-bought sports clothes and asked Dad to go out for a walk. After they came back home, mom would lose herself in magazines or newspapers about healthcare. Mom almost never gets sick. Why was she suddenly interested in medicine?\nI couldn't understand her \"abnormal\" behavior. Then one day I came across her micro blog . \"While visiting my parents during the Spring Festival, I suddenly realized that they are in their 70s now,\" my mom had written. \"They move slowly and it is hard for them to do the housework. I should visit them more often...\n\"Some cooking should be changed to keep them healthy. They like fish soup, diced potato, tender and soft vegetables...\n\"I must also keep fit by doing physical exercise. If my parents are too weak to move around, I can be strong enough to take care of them. When I am old, my son can also pay less attention to taking care of me...\"\nWhen I read this, I felt very sorry. I used to complain that Mom didn't understand me and couldn't give me everything I wanted. I always thought there was a wide gap  between us. But now I completely understand her. How great she is! She always thinks of others before herself. Everything she does is to help the people she loves live better lives. How unselfish her love is!", "id": "middle7098.txt"}
