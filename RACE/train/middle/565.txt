And everywhere he goes, he sends himself a postcard. He always chooses a postcard with beautiful scenery  . Usually he writes just a short message to himself. However, he wrote an interesting story on his latest one, from the Malians Island.\nMr. McCorpuodale lives in London. On one of the walls in his room, you can see a large map of the world. There are hundreds of little red pins   stuck in it. \"These pins mean a lot to me.\" says Mr. McCorpuodale, \"I follow the rule. I'm allowed to stick one in only if I've been in a place for more than 24 hours.\"\nNaturally, Mr. McCorpuodale has his favorite places. New Zealand, he describes as \"a wonderful country\". About China, he says, \"This is the country in the world which is completely different. There is no European influence.\"\nWherever he goes, Mr. McCorpuodale takes with him a photo of his wife, a candle, a shirt with a secret pocket and a pen.\nSo why does he do it? For the postcards or the travels? Mr. McCorpuodale laughs, \"Neither. Only for the meaningful life.\"", "id": "middle565.txt"}
