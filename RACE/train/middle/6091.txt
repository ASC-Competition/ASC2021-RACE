Each one is searching for the one great idea that could make his web company click in a big way.And they are trying all kinds of tricks to attract people towards their websites.While some websites offer sounds,cartoons and amazing photos on screen to make their sites almost a movie-like experience for the viewers,others provide free downloads and competitions.\nA company in California,US,has decided to offer online smells to people who visit its website.\nThat is,if a pizza image comes on screen,your nose will catch the smell of bread and cheese!All you need to do is to connect a device called\"iSmell\"with your computer.This smart little device contains some chemicals that can create different kinds of smells.\nThe company has invented software that changes the chemical composition of different smells into digital signals .An onscreen image,which is programmed with the proper digital signal,will start the\"iSmell\" device.The device will use the software to change' the digital signal again and let go of the correct smell.This device reads the digital smell code from the website and creates the proper smell from its store of chemicals.This smell is then made to blow softly in the direction of the user with the support of a small fan.\nIn order to let go of the correct smell,the company has created a\"Scent Registry\",which contains a digital index of thousands of smells.The company plans to allow website developers to integrate the proper smells in digital code to their games and images.The company is also hoping that Hollywood filmmakers will use the smell technology in their movies.Imagine audiences getting the smell of rocket fuel as a spacecraft takes off on the cinema screen!Of course,filmmakers will have to be careful not to shoot in dirty neighborhoods,which have a lot of rubbish lying arounD.", "id": "middle6091.txt"}
