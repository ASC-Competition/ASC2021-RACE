She found a boy sleeping in his seat. He was Teddy. Also Thompson noticed the boy didn't play well with the other children. It got to the point \"F\" at the top of his papers. Mrs. Thompson reviewed each child's past records. However, when she reviewed Teddy's file , she was in a surprise.\nTeddy's first grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is a bright child. He does his work neatly and has good manners...\"\nHis second grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is an excellent student, but he is troubled because his mother has an illness and life at home is difficult.\"\nHis third grade teacher wrote, \"His mother's death had been hard on him. He tries his best, but his father doesn't show much interest in his study...\"\nTeddy's fourth grade teacher wrote, \"Teddy is _ and doesn't talk with other's. Also he doesn't show much interest in school. He doesn't have many friends and he sometimes sleeps in class.\"\nBy now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents wrapped in beautiful and bright paper, except for Teddy's. He sent a rhinestone bracelet  with some stones missing. But Mrs. Thompson told him with a smile, \"I like it very much.\" After school Teddy said, \"Mrs. Thompson, today you smell just like my Mother used to be.\" Mrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class. Teddy became one of her \"teacher's pets.\"\n,.", "id": "middle3916.txt"}
