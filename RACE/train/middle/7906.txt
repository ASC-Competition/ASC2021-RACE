A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience take an active part in his play: they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand anything, they say so. The teacher can't learn his part by heart, but must invent it as he goes along.\nI have known many teachers who are fine actors in class but are unable to take part in a stage-play because they can't keep strictly to what another has written.", "id": "middle7906.txt"}
