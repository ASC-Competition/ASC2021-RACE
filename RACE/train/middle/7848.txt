Even a carrot dies when pulled out of the ground. It is a matter of the protection of the planet\nbecause our meat eating habits might be stressing (......) our ecological (\n) system.\nIt's no longer --might||, we are destroying our planet.\nMost of the meat that we eat comes from livestock, which is about 23 billion in population and causes the waste of our natural resources. Every second of every day one football field size rainforest is destroyed, and much of it is used to farm and raise livestock.\nRaising the animals also requires huge quantities   of water, mostly to grow\nthe grains   fed to them. It takes over 2,000 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef, which can be used for a seven-minute shower every day for a minimums   of four months. Take your pick: four months without a shower or a hamburger.\nMeat has to be cut, cleaned and processed. One doesn't just buy a cow and start eating it. According to David Pimentel from Cornell University, it takes 20 times more energy to produce beef than tofu, and both have the same good sources of protein ( ).\nThe waste from the animals is one of the main causes of water and air pollution. The animal waste cannot be used in the fields because it can spread diseases to humans. In 1995, 25 million gallons of animal waste flowed into the New River in North Carolina, killing 10 million fish and destroying 364,000 acres of coastal ( ) wetlands.\nAnimal farming also produces larger quantities of greenhouse   gases, such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). If your next Christmas is unusually hot or especially cold, blame the steak you ate the night before.\nI am not saying that everybody needs to stop eating meat right this minute. I don't think we can produce enough corns, fruits, and vegetables. I am just saying we need to\ncut our meat consumption  , 70 grams per day is okay if we want normal weather,\nclean air and drinking water.", "id": "middle7848.txt"}
