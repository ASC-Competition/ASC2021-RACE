Stop and think about what to say and do, then make a good choice.\n*Walk away the place that makes you angry and go somewhere else until you've thought about what you can do.\n*Use your words to tell your feelings. You should never hurt someone with your hands, feet or by what you say.\n*Say what you say in a strong voice, not a loud shouting voice.\n*Doing a chore that you really hate is a pretty good idea.
