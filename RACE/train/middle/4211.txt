Write and tell me more about yourself.\nQ: I'm always at the bottom of the class. What do you advise me to do? Molly.\nA: I advise you to concentrate  on improving your grades in one subject to start with. If you can do this, you should move a little way up from the bottom. Next, try to improve your grades in another subject, and so on. If you concentrate on one subject at a time, by the end of the year you should be quite a long way up from the bottom in all your classes. The Wise Owl.", "id": "middle4211.txt"}
