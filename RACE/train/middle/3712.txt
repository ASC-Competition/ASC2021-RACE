As he was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped. He found that these huge elephants were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains , no cages. It was clear that the elephants could, at any time, break away from their ropes but for some reason, they did not.\nHe saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and didn't try to get away. \"Well,\" the trainer said, \"when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it's enough to hold them. As they grow up, they still believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can hold them, so they never try to break free.\"\nHow could it be? These animals could at any time break free from their ropes. But because they always stuck right where they were, they believed they couldn't.\nJust like the elephants, how many of us go through life believing that we cannot do something, just because we failed at it once before? We should never give up the struggle  in life.", "id": "middle3712.txt"}
