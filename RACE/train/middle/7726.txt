A study of 2,000 teenagers in the US showed that eating breakfast daily is helpful to young people.\nAccording to the study, teenagers who eat breakfast weigh around 5 pounds less than teenagers who do not. Although they take in more calories in the morning, they are more active during the day because they have more energy. This means they burn more calories than non-breakfast eaters. _ \nThe study also showed that eating breakfast keeps teenagers feeling full for longer, so they will not eat too many snacks later in the day. This is good news as most popular snacks, like sweets and potato chips, are usually unhealthy and full of calories.\nAnother big advantage of eating breakfast is that it helps teenagers do better at school. This is because it gives them more energy to keep their attention in class.\nWhat's more, a study in the UK showed that adults who eat breakfast daily put on less weight and also perform better at work.\nWhatever your age is, take time to have breakfast every day.", "id": "middle7726.txt"}
