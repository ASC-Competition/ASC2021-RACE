But sometimes it's not bad to make mistakes, and here is why.\nAt first , mistakes are a clear sign that you are trying new things. It's always good to new things, because when you are trying new things your are growing. If you never try new things , how can you improve ? How can you create? The simple answer is, \" You can't .\" Look around you, everything you see is the result of someone trying new things.\nAnother good thing about mistakes is this : when your are making mistakes, you are learning. Consider this: Edison failed 10,000 times before he invented the light bulb. When he was asked how he felt to fail that many times, but rather had learned 10,000 things that didn't work.\nFinally , when you make a mistake, you are that much closer to success. Why? Because you have said what you should say, and you have done what you should do. Every time you make a mistake, you are closer to success. But it doesn't mean that you can make mistakes without thinking. Instead, when you try new things you have to think them over, so that you can keep away from some unnecessary mistakes.\nWe shouldn't spend all our time and money on the only one way , but use them correctly. Because our time and money are limited.  \nThere is an old saying, \" If you are not making mistakes, you are not trying hard enough.\" So go bravely and make mistakes. And learn. And grow. And succeed.\n,,. (5,2,10)", "id": "middle1841.txt"}
