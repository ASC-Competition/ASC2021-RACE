Do you like swimming? Yes? Well, how can you learn to swim? I think the best way is to go into the water and learn. I'm afraid you'll never learn to swim just by reading books about swimming or looking at others swimming. It's the same with the English study. We must practice, practice and practice.\nListening and speaking are very important for beginners. The children in English-speaking countries first listen to others. Then they try to imitate  and speak. We can listen to English programs on radio. You may just understand a few words. It doesn't matter. Just be relaxed, try to catch every word.\nSomebody may be a good listener. But he is terrified to speak. He's afraid of making mistakes. You know we sometimes make mistakes when we speak Chinese. Don't be afraid. We must be brave. If you really want to learn English well, you must try to speak with everyone so long as he knows English. Whether you know him or not is not important. When there's nobody to talk with, you can talk to yourself in English. It's interesting and also a good way to practice your spoken English. Remember, the more you speak, the fewer mistakes you'll make.\nReading and writing are more important for senior school students. First we must choose the books we're interested in. A lot of reading will improve your language sense . This is the most important.\nKeep writing English diaries. We can also write English articles. You may even post them to English magazines. Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is the mother of success.\nEasier said than done. Well, let's do more practice from now on. I'm sure you'll learn English better in this way.", "id": "middle2165.txt"}
