Around twenty percent of children suffer from stomachaches that doctors cannot find a reason for.\nThis new research is especially good for kids with active imaginations. Researchers found that the more creative the child is, the better he or she is at imagining the pain away.\nThe researchers used a relaxing CD with children. A voice guided them through different fantasy  situations. One of these was pretending to be floating on a cloud. Thirty children took part in the tests. Half of them used the \"guided imagery\" method, and the other half received normal medicines. Researchers found 73.3 percent of the CD users reported a reduction in pain. This compared to only 26.7 percent of kids who got normal treatment.\nStudy leader Dr Miranda Tilburg was very excited about her findings. She believed that it was a very cheap and easy way to stop children's stomachaches. She said it would not work as well with adults.", "id": "middle1990.txt"}
