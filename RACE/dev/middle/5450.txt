We had bought many things. I was feeling really tired as I was carrying our shopping bag. I decided to throw something away. I was walking towards a dustbin  when I noticed a poor man walking out of the restaurant in front of us. He walked to the nearby dustbin and started looking through it.\nI suddenly felt very sorry because I was going to throw away a new drink just because it was too heavy. I walked up to him and gave the drink and some bread to him, which surprised him. The man looked at me in surprise and took what I gave him. A big smile appeared on his face. I felt I couldn`t be happier with myself. But then he said.\"Wow, this is my son's lucky day!\"\nWith that, he thanked me happily and started off on his bike. I even heard him singing as he rode away. I got a warm feeling inside. I now understand what it means by the saying \"Giving in getting.\"\nThough it was only a little action, I got and learned more in those two minutes than I did in the rest of the month. Everyone in the world needs help. Everyone can give help and everyone can be helped.\nThe look of the man`s happiness appears in my mind whenever I have the chance to do something nice.", "id": "middle5450.txt"}
