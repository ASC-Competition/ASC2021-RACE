So they can't learn it well. But English is very easy for me. I'm good at it. I'm very glad to tell you something about how I study English.\nFirst, I think an interest in English is very important. When I was in Grade One, we had a new subject - English. It was fresh for me . I was interested in it, so I worked hard at it. Soon we had an English exam and I got a very good mark. How happy I was! After that, I learned English harder and harder. Our English teacher often teaches us English songs, the songs sound nice. I often think how interesting English is!\nSecond, I think English is a foreign language. I should learn it well in the following ways: Listen to the teacher carefully, speak bravely, read aloud and have a good vocabulary . Then practice again and again, never be tired. And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever I have a question, I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand!\nBesides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. From these I know English is not only interesting, but also useful. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well.\nAnd I also do some exercises from our class magazines, and I often write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine.\nNow I have learned English for more than two years. I always keep the first position in our school. From these words, I hope every student can learn English well.", "id": "middle849.txt"}
