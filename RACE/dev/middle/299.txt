So it is very quiet.\nOur house is in the middle of Gulangyu. Behind our house there is a big old tree. My grandfather tells me that the tree is very,very old. There are many birds in the tree. We call it a \"bird tree\". Our house is near the sea. The sea is big and blue. There are a lot of fish in the sea. After school,I go there and catch  fish with my friends. It is very interesting.
