Then place a long stemmed white carnation  in the coloured glass of water. Each day. Watch as the white carnation changes into the same colour as the food colouring. Children can see that plants drink water and where the water goes, and this is a favourite Earth Day activity for kids.\nLeaf collection\nThis Earth Day project is fun and easy to do. First, take a walk in the field and children can collect lots of leaves. When collection is complete, kids can place the leaves in between two pages of white paper and then put them together to make a leaf book.\nFeed the birds\nHere you will find an exciting Earth Day activity that helps animals, especially birds. Find or purchase a large pinecone . Cover the pinecone with butter and bread. Hang the homemade bird feeder on a tree near a window and watch the birds come to have their dinner.\nClean the park\nThere are many organized events in towns and cities for clean-up activities on Earth Day. But if one is not offered in your town or city, you can do some clean-up just by yourself in the local park. A huge clean-up is not necessary; a little help goes a long way and the idea is to show kids that keeping public areas clean is everyone's business.", "id": "middle8073.txt"}
