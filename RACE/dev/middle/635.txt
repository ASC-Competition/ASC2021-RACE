I study at a school in the UK. School days usually begin at 9 a.m. in the UK. So I usually go to school at 8.45 a.m. School is over  at 3.30 p.m. So I have enough time to go to clubs.\nI'm good at all my lessons. But my favorite lesson is Cooking. All my teachers are very friendly and helpful. I never go home for lunch, I have lunch at school with my classmates. After lunch, we often go to the school field. Sometimes we play ball games, sometimes we just sit under the trees, reading or chatting. Sometimes we also go to the Computer Center to listen to music or send e-mails  to our friends.\nI like my school and have a wonderful time at school every day.", "id": "middle635.txt"}
