As a boy, he was told he was hopeless at science and finished bottom of his class. Now, aged 79, the very same Gurdon shared the 2012 Nobe Prize in Medicine with Japanese stem cell  researcher Shinya Yamanaka.\nLike so many scientists, Gurdon shows us where the power of curiosity and perseverance  can lead.\nAt the age of 15 in 1948, Gurdon ranked last out of the 250 boys at his high school in biology and every other science subject. Gurdon's high school science teacher even said that his dream of becoming a scientist was\"quite ridiculous\".\nIn spite of his teacher s criticisms,Gurdon followed his curiosity and kept working hard. He went to the lab early and left later than anyone else. He experienced thousands of failures.\n\"My own belief is that we will, in the end, understand everything about how cells actually work,\" Gurdon said.\nIn 1962, Gurdon took a cell from an adult frog and moved its genetic information into an egg cell. The egg cell then grew into a clone  of the adult frog. This technique later helped to create Dolly the sheep in 1996, the first cloned mammal in the world.\nIn 2006,Gurdon's work was developed by Yamanaka to show that a sample of a person's skin can be used to create stem cells. Using this technique, doctors can repair a patient's heart after a heart attack.\nLuck favors the prepared mind Gurdon told the Nobel Prize Organization. \"Ninety percent of the time things don't work,but when they do,you have to seize the chance.\"", "id": "middle6275.txt"}
