They are wrinkled or hairless, or they have an angry look on their faces. They seem to say, \"Get away! I hate everybody.\" But to a parent, that hairless, wrinkled, angry-faced baby is the most beautiful and perfect child in the world. When that proud father or mother asks you, \"Well, what do you think of my baby? Isn't she beautiful?\" what are you going to say? Is the time for the true? Of course not!\nYou look that proud father in the eye and say, \"Yes, she is! She's really a beauty. She's one in a million. She's going to be a movie star! I can tell! She's as beautiful as a picture.\"\nIn English, this is a white lie. White lies don't hurt people. They are not cruel or angry words. People use them to make a difficult thing a little easier. When people don't want to meet someone, or eat something new that they really don't like at a friend's house, they tell a white lie. They are trying to be kind. They don't want to hurt someone. It's important to be honest, but many people feel that being kind is sometimes more important.", "id": "middle6939.txt"}
