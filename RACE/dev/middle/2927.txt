She was also cut off  on her career   road.\nThough the accident brought her bright career to a stop, she didn't give up. In the painful months that followed, Sudha met a doctor who developed a man-made leg for her. So strongly, she wanted to go back to dancing.  Sudha believed in herself and she thought she could realize her dream.\nAfter every public recital  , she  would ask her dad about her performance. \"You\nstill have a long way to go\" was the answer she used to get in return. In January 1984, Sudha made a historic comeback by giving a public recital in Bombay. She performed in such a great manner that it moved everyone to tears. That evening when she asked her dad the usual question, he didn't say anything. He just touched her feet as a praise. Sudha's comeback was so moving that a film producer decided to make the story into a hit film.\nWhen someone asked Sudha how she had managed to dance again, she said quite simply, \"YOU DON'T NEED FEET TO DANCE.\"  Nothing is impossible in this world. If you have the will to win, you can achieve anything.", "id": "middle2927.txt"}
