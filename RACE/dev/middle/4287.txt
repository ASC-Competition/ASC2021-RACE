I'm from New York. I'm living in a small town in the UK now. The name of the town is Ketton. It's very far from the centre of the city. There is only one main road in this town. You can see a shop ,a restaurant and a beer bar along the road. There is a church in the centre of the town. Most of the people here go to the church on Sunday morning. There is a lake and a forest  to the east of the town. People often go for picnics there.\nMy house is not very big. It has two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom and a glass room. I grow some flowers in the glass room, too. I often read books and drink tea there. I really like this room because I can enjoy the beautiful sunshine in it. I often talk with my friends there too.\nI teach English in a local school. My life is quiet and happy. I love it.", "id": "middle4287.txt"}
