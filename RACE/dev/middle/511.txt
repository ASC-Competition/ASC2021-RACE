Now, the 3-D version of the movie will come to Chinese theaters on April 10.\nAs anyone who has seen the movie knows, the Titanic struck an iceberg  and sank on its first _ in 1912, killing 1,517 people. A century after the accident, scientists have found something new to blame  for the sinking: the moon. Donald Olson, a Texas State University physicist, led a team of astronomers  to examine the moon's role, according to Reuters.\nNormally, icebergs stay in place and cannot move until they melt enough or a high tide  frees them. A single iceberg can become stuck many times on its journey southward. The process can take several years.\nAccording to Olson, a hundred years ago the moon made its closest approach to the Earth in more than 1,400 years. This caused the moon to have a much stronger pull on the Earth's oceans than usual, which created a super-high tide. The tide pushed icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Canada's provinces, Newfoundland and Labrador, into the Titanic's way.\n\"Of course, the final cause of the accident was that the ship struck an iceberg,\" Olson told Reuters. \"It went full speed into a region with icebergs, but thelunar connection  may explain how an unusually large number of icebergs got into the path of the Titanic.\"\nThe research team will publish their research in the April issue of Sky & Telescope magazine.\n,,.", "id": "middle511.txt"}
