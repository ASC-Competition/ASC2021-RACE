If she won't do that,you should talk to her parents or to a teacher.\nDear Simon,\nYou feel ashamed because you should have helped the woman.You are right.Your friends were cruel to that woman.We all want our friend to like us.But we don't have to follow our friends all the time.You're a good boy.You should be strong enough to make up your own mind next time.", "id": "middle3626.txt"}
