Now, however, there is proof that dolphins may be even cleverer than these big apes.\nAlthough a dolphin lives in the sea, it is not a fish. It is a mammal. It is in many ways, therefore, like a human being .\nDolphins have a simple language. They are able to talk to one another. It may be possible for man to learn how to talk to dolphins. But this will not be easy because dolphins can not hear the kind of sounds man can make. If man wants to talk to dolphins, therefore, he will have to make a third language which both he and the dolphins can understand.\nDolphins are also very friendly towards man. They often follow ships. There are many stories of dolphins guiding ships through difficult and dangerous waters.", "id": "middle3372.txt"}
