He was sitting in class, but had no idea what the other students were talking about. He had done his homework, paid attention to lectures, and taken notes, but nothing was familiar. \"Everyone is so much cleverer than I am,\" he thought. It was a strange feeling, as he was always a good student in high school.\nHe felt even more puzzled a few days later. He got lost on his way to his favorite cinema. What's worse, he began having trouble finding the right words when speaking. He asked, \"What's for dinner, Mom?\" after he had just eaten.
