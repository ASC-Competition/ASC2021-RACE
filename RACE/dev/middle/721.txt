Yale, Princeton, Columbia and Dartmouth were opened soon after Harvard.\nIn the early years, these schools were nearly the same. Only young men went to college. All the students studied the same subjects, and everyone learned Latin and Greek. Little was known about science. And few people knew that one kind of school could teach everything that was known about the world. When the students graduated, most of them became ministers or teachers.\nIn 1782, Harvard started a medical school for young men who wanted to become doctors. Later, lawyers could study in Harvard's law school. In 1825, besides Latin and Greek, Harvard began to teach modern languages, such as French and German. Soon it began to teach American history.\nAs knowledge increased, Harvard and other colleges began to teach many new subjects. Students were allowed to choose the subjects that interested them.\nToday, there are many different kinds of colleges and universities. Most of them are made up of smaller schools that deal with special fields of learning. There's so much to learn that one kind of school can't offer all.", "id": "middle721.txt"}
