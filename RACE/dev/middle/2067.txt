School education is very important and useful ,but no one can learn everything from school. A teacher ,no matter how much he knows ,cannot teach his student everything .His work is to show his students how to learn .He teaches them how to read and how to think . So much more is to be learned outside school by students themselves.\nIt's always more important to know how to learn by oneself than to learn some facts or formulas  by heart. It's quite easy to learn some facts in history or a formula in maths, but it's very difficult to use them. Edison and Einstein didn't get everything from school, but they were all successful. They invented so many things. The reason for their success is that they knew how to study .They read many books outside school .They worked hard all their lives, wasting not a single moment. The most important thing is that they know how to use their brains .", "id": "middle2067.txt"}
