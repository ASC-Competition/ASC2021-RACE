Internet users can find hundreds of them. These books are from around the world. And they are free to readers. The United States has started a project called the International Children's Digital Library. It is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Library of Congress and the institute of Museum and Library Services.\nThe goal of the project is to offer more than 10,000 children's electronic books in at least 100 languages. Some of the books show the similarities and differences in ways of life around the world. They will enable children to have a better understanding of other people's cultures. People working for this project have tried to design easy ways to search the collection and read the books. A picture of each page appears on the computer. Users can also print the pages on paper if they want to.\nThe project is for two main groups of users. The first group is children between the ages of three and thirteen, along with their teachers and parents. The second group is researchers of children's literature . The books can help children understand more about the world.", "id": "middle205.txt"}
