He has written 3 books so far. Dou Kou was born in Jiangsu Province in 1994. When he was 7 months old, his parents started working in over 30 different cities, such as Xi'an and Shenzhen. This kind of life gave him things to think and write about.\nWhen Dou Kou was 9 months old, he could speak and at the age of one he could say five to six hundred words. At 3, he could look up words in the dictionary. At 4, his father taught him to learn something. His parents like reading very much. So does he. At the age of 5, he began writing fairy tales.\nHis fairy tales are all from his life. One day, he found many mice in the house. They not only ate their food but also hurt his mother's hand. So he thought, \"If we give mice the stomachs (  ) of cows, they'll eat grass and it'll be helpful to people. \" This was his first fairy tale \"Change Stomachs for Mice\". At 6, he wrote a novel about his own life in different cities with his parents.\nNow, he studies well in a middle school. He has written his third book, the novel called \"Eyes of Childhood\". He says, \"I am not different from other children. I just wrote several books,", "id": "middle1163.txt"}
