Many students do not like to worry about money, and they would rather not think about it. But, it doesn't matter whether a student's parents pay for everything, or whether the students work part-time to help pay for his or her education. All students can get into money trouble if they're not careful.\nThe cost of a college education can be quite expensive. In English-speaking countries, the average cost per student per year is well over US$10,000. Students must also pay for books, paper, pens, and etc. These can cost $500 to $1,000 per year. Students who live in university housing pay thousand more per year for room and board . Add money for clothes, travel, and other personal expenses, and the cost of one year at a university can be $20, 000 to $30,000 or more.\nStudents need to spend their money carefully. At most universities, advisors can give students advice on how to budget  their money. They suggest this: at the start of a school term, write down your income; for example, money you will get from your family or a part-time job. Then, list all of your expenses. Put your expenses into two groups: those that change (food, phone, books, travel), and those that will stay the same (tuition, room and board). Add together all of your expenses. Are they more than your income? Do you have enough money, or do you need more?\nLearning not to spend more money than you have is not always easy. But for many, it is easier than borrowing money from family or friends.", "id": "middle5210.txt"}
