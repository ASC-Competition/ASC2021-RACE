Those statistics  have now given some users of the \"Moments\"  function on WeChat the idea of turning their \"friends\" into customers.\nThe \"Moments\" function on WeChat is closed system that allows you to send photos and messages only to your friends. It ensures more privacy  and it helps you avoid receiving spam  from sellers. But some users were quick to see the business opportunities of \"Moments\" and have turned it into a mini-marketplace. They are recommending   products to their friends and offering to either sell the products directly or act as a middleman  for the purchases.\nOne woman told the Shanxi Evening News that she makes money as a middleman, or purchasing agent. She added a few sellers of fake  handbags to her friends list and posts pictures of the handbags. When a friend is interested in buying a bag, they pay her the money and she has the sellers send the goods. \"There are zero costs for storage and logistics ,\" she says, \"and I make money simply from the price difference.\" It's a nice business model, but the woman didn't seem to know that she was doing something against the law by selling fakes to her friends.\nAnother woman was connected with even more dishonest business. She sold facial masks  that had \"magical\" effects to make women's skin beautiful. Unluckily, the masks caused the faces of some of her \"friends\" to break out in red spots and pimples , and when they asked for _ , the woman magically disappeared.\nSocial media is easier to stay connected with friends and to share your experiences with them. And it's OK to \"recommend\" something or try to make money from your friends. Turning your friends into customers is a sure way to lose those friends.", "id": "middle6118.txt"}
