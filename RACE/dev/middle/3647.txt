I think I have a good habit. I take an active part in sports. After school, I often play ball games with my classmates. I don't like indoor activities. I'm hardly ill, and I haven't caught colds for years. I get up at the same time every morning and go to bed at the same time every night. I always sleep for nine hours each night, and I always feel refreshed   in the morning.\nMy cousin, however, has a very bad living habit. She never does exercise.
