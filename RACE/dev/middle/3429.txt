She visited Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and her family's native place   Romania where 5,000 fans came to see her at the airport. Alexandra said, \"When it all started, I was moved. It was very exciting and I loved the traveling, but I got very tired. And I missed home.\"\nAlexandra is a good student. Her studies always come first. She only starts painting after she's done her homework. She works on two or three paintings at a time. The paintings sell for thousands and Alexandra's parents have given up their jobs to work for their daughter. Life for the Nechita family is very different from what it was like a few years ago.\nAlexandra's father Niki left Romania for political reasons in 1985. At first he tried his best to learn English and had different kinds of low-paid jobs. In 1987, he brought his wife and Alexandra, who was then 18 months old, to America. The family was very poor. Alexandra began to draw at the age of three.\nShe was drawing for four or five hours a day. Soon people offered to buy her paintings and she had her first art show at the age of eight.

Her mother said, \"We started without anything, but thanks to Alexandra, we have everything we ever dreamed of.\"", "id": "middle3429.txt"}
