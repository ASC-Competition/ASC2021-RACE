We have no little brother or big sister . Our family consists of our mom , our dad and us . We are growing up in a world greatly different from our parents' . Yet we will be the future leader of China. We will someday have to work together and carry China into the beautiful future . So , we must learn to love each other like brothers and sisters !\nIt' s hard to think about how different life would be if we had a brother or a sister . We never have to share anything at home ! of course , we might have cousins, but we don' t have to live with them ! Our parents try to give us the best , and the best doesn't need sharing between two or three children . Do we ever ask ourselves if we are spoiled ?\nSomeone thinks that we are spoiled because we don't know the value of money, because we don' t know how hard our parents work but mainly because we many children don' t know how to love ! We don' t want others to regard us as spoiled , do we ? Well, why not start now to help our parents at home or share a game with one of our friends? In a word, We must learn to love each other !", "id": "middle2750.txt"}
