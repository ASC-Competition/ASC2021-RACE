He lived in the country, and came to work by train. He liked walking from the station to his office if it was not raining, because it gave him some exercises. One morning he was walking along the street when a stranger  stopped him and said to him, \" You may not remember me, sir, but seven years ago  I came to London without any money in my pocket . I stopped you in this street and asked you to lend  me some money, and you lent me five pounds , because you said that you were happy to take a chance so as to give a man a start on the road to success.\" Mr. Grey thought for a few moments and then said, \" Yes, I remember you. Go on  with your story.\" \" Well,\" answered the stranger,\" are you still willing to take a chance?\"", "id": "middle4237.txt"}
