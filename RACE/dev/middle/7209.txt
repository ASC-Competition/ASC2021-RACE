The neck of four-footed animals is usually long, to have them reach their food without difficulty, but the elephant has a short neck, to make him more easily support the weight of his huge head and heavy teeth. His long trunk lets him get his food easily.\nThe trunk of an elephant is to him what the neck is to other animals. It is also a nose to him, for at the end of it there is a empty place like a cup, and in the bottom of the cup are two holes, and the animal smells and breathes through them. It is an arm and a hand too, so that it has been said that the elephant carries his nose in his hand, and it might also have been said that he breathes by hi s hand.\nAt the end of the trunk, there is a strange part, about five inches long, which forms a finger. With this finger the animal can pick up the smallest piece of money from the ground, and he has been taught to make marks like letters with a pen.\nThe trunk of a full-grown elephant is about eight feet long. The elephant has such great strength that he can knock down a man with it.", "id": "middle7209.txt"}
