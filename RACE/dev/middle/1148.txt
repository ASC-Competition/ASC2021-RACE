People can build panel cookers quickly. They do not cost much. In Kenya, for example, panel cookers cost just two dollars.\nThe third kind of sun-cooker is a parabolic cooker. It has rounded walls that concentrate sunlight into the bottom of the cooker. Food cooks quickly in parabolic cookers. However, these cookers are hard to make. They must be moved again and again to follow the sun. Parabolic cookers can also cause burns and eye injuries if they are not used correctly.\nYou can make sun-cookers from boxes or heavy paper.
