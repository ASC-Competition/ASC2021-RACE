This camp is run by the Fresh Air Fund . Since 1877, the fund has helped poor children from New York City spend summers in the country. Each year, over one thousand children, age 6--18,take part in the program. Some stay at the camp; others live with host families. The fund pays all money.\nThe camp is for 8 to 15-year-olds. At camp, children can learn about the stars, see deer and cows and other animals, and go hiking, fishing, and of course swimming. The children learn responsibility  by helping out with chores like making beds and waiting on tables. They also learn a lot from teachers, who are often college students from around the United States and from other countries.\nHost families from thirteen states and Canada offer to have children spend the summer with them. Many of these families have their own children. The visiting children become part of the family. They go with the family on picnics, to the pool or beach, and on trips. The children are from 6 to 12 years old when they make their first visit, and most are invited back. Some of the children and families become friends for life.", "id": "middle6749.txt"}
