She was not sure what gave her the idea, but she wanted to look like a movie star. \"I have a lot of pictures from my childhood of me wearing sunglasses,\" she says. \"I used to wear them to watch TV.\"\nEarly movie actors started wearing sunglasses, not because they looked good, but because their eyes hurt. The lights used on movie sets were really bright and could cause a painful problem known as \"Klieg eyes\". It was named after the Klieg brothers who invented the lights. Actors wore sunglasses to give their eyes a rest. But when movie stars began wearing their sunglasses in public, they quickly became a must.\nFrom then on, actors started wearing sunglasses in their movies as well as on the street. Audrey Hepburn wore ultra-cool Ray-Ban sunglasses in the 1961 movie, Breakfast at Tiffany's. As a result, Ray-Ban sunglasses started to appear more and more in the movies. In 1979, Ray-Ban \"Wayfarers\" were worn by Jake and Elwood in The Blue Brothers. Tom Cruise wore Ray-Ban \"Aviator\" sunglasses in the 1986 hit, Top Gun. Then in 1997, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones made Ray-Ban \"Predator\" sunglasses famous in Men in Black.", "id": "middle8111.txt"}
