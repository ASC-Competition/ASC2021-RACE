During the graduation party, one of her classmates gave a simple speech that I will remember. She talked about the \"givers\" of this world. She said, \"You are a success if you make another person smile. If you are a friend to someone who needs a little help, you get an 'A'!\"\nAfter the party, when all the students were outside the hall trying to find their parents and friends, a man and his wife came to me and asked if I was Becky's mom. I said yes and the man handed me a gift and told me how much they would like thank Becky for her kindness to their daughter, Jessica, during the school sports meeting the week before.\nJessica's left leg was hurt and she was not able to finish the up-hill race. Becky was worried about her and kept going back to check on her. Jessica's dad told me that Becky had shown more kindness for her daughter than even the coach, and that he and his wife would never forget her kindness. Of course, by this time I had tears in my eyes, I was so proud of her.\nI asked her, \"So, does Becky get an 'A'?\"\nHe just smiled and said, \"She gets an 'A'!\"", "id": "middle4394.txt"}
