He lived in the house on the side of a hill. There was a railroad track below the house and Andy often watched the train as it passed by.\nOne day, as Andy was crossing the track, he saw that there was something wrong with it. One of the rails seemed to be out of its place. Just then he heard a noise. Dear, dear! The train was coming! It would soon be there! He must try to stop it in some way.\nAndy did not think of any danger to himself, but he ran and stood in the middle of the track, not far from the place where the rail was broken, and then he held out his arms and waited.\nOn and on came the train. The engineer saw the boy on the track and whistled for him to get out of the way. But Andy stood still and did not move.\nThe engineer had to stop the train. He was very angry as he cried out to the boy and asked him why he stood on track.\nBut when Andy pointed to the broken rail ,the man understood everything. Andy saved the train and the lives of all the people on it.", "id": "middle2887.txt"}
