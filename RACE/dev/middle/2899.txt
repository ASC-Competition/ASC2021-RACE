Not a problem! Throw on some running shoes and comfortable clothes and go for a run.\nOne of the coolest things about the sport of running is that you don't need expensive equipment . All you need is a good pair of running shoes and a safe environment. But just because you don't need much equipment don't be fooled into thinking the sport of running is easy. No one wakes up and decides to run a marathon without training.\nRunning makes your heart, lungs, and muscles stronger. It makes you know more about your body. Running also gives you energy by increasing your oxygen  intake, so you don't get sick easily. It can even help you keep your mind on school work because exercise helps you to think more clearly.\nHow do you take part in the sport if you don't know much about it? Most schools offer cross-country and track programs, but there are also running clubs open to all ages. A simple Internet search can help you find some in your area. The programs show you how running can offer competition or just be for fun. They also teach runners to set realistic goals and take care of their bodies.\nRunners have great respect for each other because they know how difficult the sport can be. If you go to a race, you'll see people cheering for all the runners, from the first place finisher to the last place finisher. Running isn't always about how fast you are or how far you're going. It's about getting out there and doing it. Taking part is more important than competition, and effort is recognized over gift.\nIf you're looking for more than just a sport, running may be the perfect choice for you.", "id": "middle2899.txt"}
