As an adult you know what to do during a disaster, but what about the children? Some adults think it would probably never happen to them, so they don't teach their children what to do. Before it's too late, here are ways to help you prepare your child for a disaster:\nEducate: It is always good to let your child know about possible disasters. This doesn't mean children have to live in fear. When teaching them about disasters, keep the conversation positive by telling them there is a solution to the disaster. Keep the conversations short, allow for questions and answer honestly.\nPrepare: Always be prepared, that is the best advice for children. For example, when preparing for bad weather, get the tools you need, like candles, radios, food, water and medicine. Teach your child what is needed in certain disasters so that they know what is available for them, if ever needed.\nPlan: You should always have a plan for you and your child for any dangerous situation. Write out a simple list that they can read. The plan could start with \"listen to an adult's advice and/or call 119\".\nPractice: Once you have got the correct safety tools and worked out the right plan, practice every few months. Practicing what to do during a disaster with your child will help them if the time comes.\nDisasters can't be avoided but they can be lessened once you are prepared and ready for one.", "id": "middle7234.txt"}
