You may feel lonely at break or lunchtime. You want to have new friends, but how do you make them? Maybe it seems like everybody else already has their friends. But remember, there's always room for more friends.\nStart by looking around your classroom ----think about which kids you'd like to play with at break. Look for chances to say hi to them,smile,and be friendly .Offer to share something or express your appreciation  to them. Invite someone to play with you or say\" Do you want to sit here?\" in the lunchroom. When you're at break,walk over to kids you want to play with ,act friendly, and say \"Hi,can I play,too?\"or just join in.\nIf you have trouble doing _ or if you're feeling shy, ask your teacher to help you make new friends. Teachers are usually pretty good at matching up friends. The best way to make friends is to be a friend. Be kind, be friendly,share,say nice things, offer to help----and pretty soon, you'll have one, or two, or even more new friends.\nYou might still miss that special best friend.
