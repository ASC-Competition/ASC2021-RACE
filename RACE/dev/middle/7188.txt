There, my team and I are trying to learn more about the American black duck,a kind of water bird.And now we are using an exciting piece of equipment called a \"night vision scope\".By using it,we can see the ducks in the dark.\nWe're worried about black ducks mainly because their numbers are falling _ And we don't know whether there's enough food on the east coast for these birds.There's lots of information about their daytime activities,but nothing about what they do at night,because we don't have the equipment.
