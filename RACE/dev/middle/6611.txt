If you have, here's the device for you: the virtual  fitting room.\nThe technology, designed by Russian company AR Door, was first tried out in May. When a customer walks into a \"fitting\" room, they'll stand in front of a big screen that looks like a mirror. A camera in the mirror, using Microsoft Kinect, monitors a customer's movement and projects a 3-D image of the clothes onto you while you stand before a screen.\nThe room also uses augmented reality technology. \"Augmented reality allows the customers to choose an item of clothing without having to try it on physically,\" the company told the Daily Mail. A customer can spin around to see all angles  of the clothes, and can control the program by pushing virtual buttons.\nAR Door is not the only company to be developing technology to help people with the way they look. Japanese company Shiseido recently presented its Magic Mirror, a virtual make-up mirror that allows people to get a full makeover in seconds.\nHowever, the technology is not perfect. The clothes still seem to hang on the surface of the body, rather than look like the customer is actually wearing them. And people shopping for clothes are probably still better off actually trying them on.\nIn the end, you won't know how something really looks and feels.", "id": "middle6611.txt"}
