Doctors say the average IQ of a person is about 100.\nShe learned to read at the age of 2. She reads at a fifth grade level and has taught herself Spanish on her parents' iPad!\nNow, she is a member of the Mensa Club, which only accepts people with an IQ within the top two per cent of people in the world!\nAlexis' father, Ian Martin, said he first realized Alexis was special when she was 12 months old. She could recite   bedtime stories. \"We'd be driving around in the car and she would recite her bedtime stories from the night before. She didn't just recite them, and she recited them exactly.\"\nAlexis' father would try to trick her and say that her story went a different way, but she always corrected him.\nMost 12-month-old children take their first steps on their own and most 18-month-olds can only name a small number of objects and body parts, and follow simple two-step questions.\nEven though Alexis is a genius  , her parents are faced with lots of challenges like how to teach her to make friends of her own age.\n\"Will she go into kindergarten early? We are kind of hesitant   because we do want her to get to that social world,\" Ian said.", "id": "middle4669.txt"}
