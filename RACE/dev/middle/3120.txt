My family had decided to go back to the countryside in New Hampshire, US, again. But I found it boring. What made the holiday even worse was that I had to sleep in the same bed as my brother. But I was wrong. This trip was the best holiday I have ever had. During the holiday, I met a very special friend.\nWhile I was walking in the countryside, I saw a man carrying a small brown bag. Wearing white clothes, the man looked like a ghost. As he looked at me, I felt frightened. I wanted to run away when the man spoke to me. \"Hello. Beautiful day, isn't it?\" he said. The man talked a lot. I wasn't listening very carefully because I was looking at his little bag. I wanted to see what was inside it!\nHe saw me looking at the bag and he asked me if I would like to see. Out came a lively, beautiful puppy. The brown puppy was small and only about two months old. The man then asked me, \"Would you like to keep this puppy?\" I had always wanted a puppy and now I had the chance. I thanked him, took the puppy and ran home. For the rest of that summer, I played with him all the time. And after the trip, I took him home. The puppy is now loved by all my family. He is a friend to both my brother and me, a warm little ball of happiness in our lives.\nI've always wanted to thank the man because he changed my life. His gift has given me years of pleasure. And I never have boring family holidays anymore.", "id": "middle3120.txt"}
