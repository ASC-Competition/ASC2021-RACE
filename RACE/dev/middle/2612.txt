The two climbers were climbing an ice-covered wall of the mountain when they suddenly lost their footing and fell about 560 feet to a narrow snow-covered ledge  below. \"We were lucky that ledge was there,\" said the climbers, \"Otherwise, we would have fallen over 2,000 feet.\" If the ledge had not been there, the two climbers almost certainly have met their death. \"It's a wonder,\" the climbers said, \"that we landed on the ledge, and the snow was loose enough to cushion  our fall. We're thankful that we survived.\"\nWhen a reporter asked them if they planned to give up mountain climbing after their narrow escape , the two climbers replied, \"Not at all. We'll be going back up there just as soon as we get out of the hospital.\"", "id": "middle2612.txt"}
