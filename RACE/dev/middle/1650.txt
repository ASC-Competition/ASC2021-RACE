The parts for the bodies and engines were hand-made and the cars were built from these. One at a time. This took a long time, and the cars cost a lot of money. Then a quicker and cheaper way of making cars was found. Instead of making all the parts at their own works, some car factories asked other factories to make some of them. All the parts were then fitted together in the car factories.\nModern car-making factoriess are so large that each one is really a lot of factories close together. Each workshop makes some parts. The pieces of a car body are joined together by welders  . All the bits and pieces that make up each car are collected and put ready for the assembly line  , where they are fitted together.", "id": "middle1650.txt"}
