Love can, too.\nA pair of 16-year-old American twins, Jack and Jake Moran, stared a program called \"Warm Hearts, Warm Hands\" last month. Their aim was to collect new and used gloves with fellow students at Richards High School.\n\"We started this program a few weeks ago after we saw something on the news about a student who got frostbite riding his bike to school,\" Jack said. \"I just kind of realized that there are so many kids who don't have or wear gloves. The school has started the collection competition among classes, and the class that collects the  most gloves gets a pizza party.\nThe twin brothers talked to other students about their program.
