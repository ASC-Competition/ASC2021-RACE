Very. Every year her classmates voted  her the favorite student. The friends she had were much more than those of anyone else.\nOne day Mini was caught yakkety-yakking  and ordered to stay back as punishment . Staying back meant doing something \"useful\", like helping in the library after school.\nNow Mini's school had a rule. Once a month, if you had something else to do the day you were punished, you could ask a friend to stand in for you.\nUnluckily, her aunt was visiting Mini that day. That afternoon was the only chance Mini had of seeing her for another five years.\nMini needed someone to stand in for her. She asked Betty, her \"best\" friend. \"Oh, no, Mini, I can't,\" Betty said. \"I must help my brother do his homework.\"\n\"Tony, will you stay back for me?\" Mini asked another friend. \"I wish you'd told me earlier.
