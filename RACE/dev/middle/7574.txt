Her parents didn't want to give up their jobs in Guangdong. Also they couldn't afford the cost of sending her to a school in the city where they work.\nThese are just two of the 29 kids interviewed last summer in a village in Sichuan Province.\nIn the poor village, 582 adults have left to look for work, leaving 156 children without parents. Among these kids, 88 percent of them live with their grandparents, five percent live with their uncles or aunts and seven percent have to live on their own.\nTo our surprise, 80 percent of the children say they love going to school, even though some children have to walk along the mountain roads for two hours to get to school However, for these children, studying is not their main thing. Doing housework and taking care of younger sisters or brothers take up most of their time. Though they have to work hard at home, over 65 percent of the kids interviewed prefer that their parents can work outside. They understand how important money is for their families.", "id": "middle7574.txt"}
