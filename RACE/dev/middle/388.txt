Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones since 1851, when William Kay and his sons Andrew and Thomas set up a workshop in Mauchline, Ayrshire, in southwest Scotland. Kays is still owned by the relatives of the founder, and today it is the only curling stone maker left in Scotland.\nUsed in a highly competitive sport, the curling stones are made to exact standards. First, stones are _ and then into round \"cheeses\". Finally, the cheeses are shaped and polished into curling stones in a series of steps.\nEach stone must weigh 44 pounds. Each must have a maximum diameter   of 36 inches. Polishing is done by hand on a wheel using water, diamond-talcum power, and felt. Finishing the stone's \"running edge\" is done entirely by hand with a special kind of paper and a digital measure and magnifying glass  . Lastly, a handle  is fitted into holes on the top of the stone. Stones are computer-matched into pairs. Sixteen stones----8 pairs----are needed for a game, and since curling game field usually have 6 lanes, each game field needs 96 matched stones!\nKays is a small company, employing less than ten skilled workers. Master craftsman and co-owner James Wyllie is skilled at all phases of curling stone making and is also an enthusiastic curler, as well as active member of Mauchline's Burns Club, which meets regularly to honor well-known Mauchline residents.", "id": "middle388.txt"}
