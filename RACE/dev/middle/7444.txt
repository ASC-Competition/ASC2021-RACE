He had seen some red-tail hawks, red foxes, wood turtles and other animals. He also found special native flowers.\nSuddenly it was announced that the \"empty\" land would be improved by a lot of houses on it. The plants would be removed, the animals would run away and most would probably die. Then the wet soil would be covered with extra grounds.\nWhen he heard about the news, he was not happy. He was very worried that the land ans water would be polluted.\nAndrew wrote down clearly all the research he had down about the area, and how the houses would affect the local environment. He sent letters to members of local government and television reporters. He also called on his neighbors to _ the building of the houses.\nAlthough he was only 12 years old, he had the courage and wisdom of a person much older. Andrew' s teachers described him as gentle, shy and active. His classmates also admired how much he knew about local animals and plants,and the environment.Each day after school, Andrew went door-to-door, to ask the people to sign, who did not want the houses to be built. In only one month, he got the signatures of 250 people.\nIn the end, the land remained a safe place for birds, animals and plants that belonged there.\nAndrew won many prizes for his brave and great work to stop the houses being built,and thus help save the environment.", "id": "middle7444.txt"}
