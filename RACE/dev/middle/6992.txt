He didn't move and just sat with his head down staring at  his hands. I sat down beside him. He didn't realize it and the longer I sat, the more I wondered if he was okay. Finally, not really wanting to disturb him but wanting to check on him, I asked him if he was okay. He raised his head and looked at me and smiled. \"Yes, I'm fine. Thank you for asking,\" he said in a clear strong voice. I said, didn't mean to disturb  you, Dad, but you were just sitting there staring at your hands and I wanted to make sure you were alright.\" \"Have you ever looked at your hands?\" he asked. \"I mean really looked at your hands?\" I slowly opened my hands and stared down at them. I turned them over again and again.\nDad smiled and said, \"Stop and think for a moment about the hands you have. How have they served  you well throughout your years? Though these hands are thin and weak, they have been the tools I have used all my life.\"\n\"That's right! They caught my fall when as a baby I crashed upon the floor. They put food in my mouth and clothes on my back. When I was a little girl, my mother taught me to fold them to pray. They tied my shoes and pulled on my boots. They dried the tears of my children. They wiped my tears when my son went off  to war,\" I said.\nAfter that day, I never looked at my hands the same again.", "id": "middle6992.txt"}
