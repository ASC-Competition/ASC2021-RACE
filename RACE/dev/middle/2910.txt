After the big exam, most of you will go on to study in a senior school. What are you expecting from senior high school? Let's hear some teen readers talk about it.\nZhou Zhijie, 15, from Shanghai:\nI have heard that although Senior 3 is a hard year, Senior 1 and Senior 2 are less _ . I hope there'll be time then to enjoy sports. There will be plenty to see. Especially, the World Cup in Brazil is coming. We can watch football matches. I'm sure I'll really enjoy it.\nJin Xi, 16, from Harbin, Heilongjiang:\nI really enjoy science. I visit many science exhibitions. I am interested in UFOs, too. I'm crazy about making model planes, although I'm not very good at it because I don't really have enough scientific knowledge. I'll be learning more science in senior high school. In a word, sometime in the future I'm going to build an excellent model plane!\nWang Yaling, 15, from Xiamen, Fujian:\nI hope I can be taller in senior high school. I'm only 155cm. Many people grow faster in senior and I hope I will, too. I want to be 162cm. But I'm not sure about that, since most girls in my family don't grow taller than 160cm. I hope I'm different.\nZhang Fang, 15, from Hebi, Henan:\nI expect that I'll make more friends in senior high school. I study in a middle school in the country. Most of my classmates live nearby. In senior high school, I'll meet different people from different areas. I hope I can learn new things from them.\n,.", "id": "middle2910.txt"}
