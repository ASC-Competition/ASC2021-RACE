Isn't it fun? To eat grass, a Swiss farmer Dieter Mueller's cow climbed up a roof to look for fresh grass.\nMueller said the cow was walking on a road behind the house. Then she thought the grass may be greener on the other side of it, but it didn't walk around, it decided to climb over the house. In fact the grass was not greener on the other side.\nMueller said this is a _ cow. She always does her way. And never follow his words. So it is quite difficult for her to get her down! Mueller tried to let her get down and even put a ladder up to the roof, but it doesn't work. She stayed up there as long as she liked. She just had to do things in her own sweet time.\nAt last she was tired to stay on the farmhouse roof and found the way to get down herself.\nThat's really good news.", "id": "middle5069.txt"}
