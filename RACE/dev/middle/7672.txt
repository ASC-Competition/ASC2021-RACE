Karen is only a few months older than me. I think she is very beautiful. She has long hair and blue eyes. I love Karen so much, because she is such a nice friend. I can share my secrets with her and I am never afraid that she will tell my secrets to others. But I am not such a good friend. I sometimes get angry easily.\nOne day, when we were in Grade 4, Karen was going to another friend's home and asked me to go along with her. But I didn't want to go to that friend's home that day. I also didn't want her to go. Instead, I wanted to go boating with her. However, Karen said she must go to that friend's home. She said she didn't want to break her words. I became angry and ran away.\nLater that day, I received a call from Karen's mother. She told me that Karen had a car accident that day and was in hospital. I immediately ran to the hospital to see if she was OK.\nLuckily, Karen wasn't seriously hurt. That day, I was afraid that I would lose Karen forever. At that time, I knew how important she was in my life. I decided never to be angry with her again.", "id": "middle7672.txt"}
