Archaeologists  confirm that the tomb found in Xihu township of Yangzhou belongs to Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty. Do you know Emperor Yang Guang? He is considered as one of the worst tyrants  who brought the Sui Dynasty to an end in Chinese history. But in fact, he started the construction of the Grand Canal  to connect the North and the South, making Yangzhou a transportation hub  city.\nAs we know, Emperor Yang loved Yangzhou very much. Throughout his life, he paid three visits to Yangzhou. On his first tour to Yangzhou, he stayed here for eight months. And the second time, he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle in Yangzhou. He watched the song and dance shows all day and stayed in Yangzhou for nearly a year. The third time, he enjoyed himself drinking wine without planning to go back to the capital. It lasted for almost one and a half years. In the year AD 618, Emperor Yang was killed by his followers in one of his palaces in Yangzhou, and the Sui Dynasty ended.\nEveryone complains that the Sui Dynasty ended because of the Grand Canal. However, it is still an important way for people to travel. In the year AD 605, Emperor Yang ordered the canal to be dug. Digging such a long canal proved to be very difficult. 3.6 million people worked on it and in less than a year many of them lost their lives. When the construction was completed, the journey from the north to the south became more direct. It is the longest canal in the world. It runs from Beijing to Hangzhou, covering a distance of nearly 1,800 kilometres and joining five rivers including the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Even today, the Grand Canal still plays an important role in travel. Every day, ships go up and down the canal, carrying things between the north and the south.", "id": "middle6682.txt"}
