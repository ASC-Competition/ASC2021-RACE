If you decided to do your homework right after school, you may get something to eat before getting to work. Always do your homework before you get too tired. Don't wait until very late in everything, or your work will seem much harder than it really is.\nIf you have more than an hour's work, give yourself a break after an hour. On the other hand, don't _ so much, or you can't finish anything, you should be able to work at least a half at a time without stopping.\nDon't put it off until the last minute. If you put off doing your homework, you will have it on your mind, and you will not enjoy your free time so much. If you put it off until the end of the week or until right before a test, you will have too much work to do. A little bit each night, enough to keep up with what is happening each day in school, will make you not afraid of the test and get good grades.\nDo your homework at the same time every evening. This will help you make it a habit. It will make it easier to do, and it will make your free time more enjoyable, as well.", "id": "middle6637.txt"}
