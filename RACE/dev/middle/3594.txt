Our planet is covered with atmosphere  . Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and reaches the Earth. The Sun heats up the Earth's surface. When the heat rises into the air, it is stopped by some special gases  in the atmosphere like CO2, the heat returns to the Earth and keeps _ warm.\nPower stations and cars release   so many greenhouse gases every day. So we can help stop global  warming by using less electric things such as turning off lights when we leave a room, asking our parents to turn down the heating in our house to save energy. We can also stop global warming by finding other ways of transportation. For example, ride a bicycle or walk instead of going by car. Another way to help stop global warming is to plant and care for trees. Because trees take in CO2, they are our best friends when fighting against global warming.\nThe problem of global warming cannot be solved in a day. It may take a long time to find clean energy, such as wind energy. It may take a long time to plant the trees again we are cutting down. But every little thing each person can do to save energy and our forests will help. Think about our planet. Think about ways we can help make the Earth a safe and comfortable place for the future.", "id": "middle3594.txt"}
