Follow this short lesson about self confidence.\nHenry Ward Beecher was a well-known American churchman, social reformer  and speaker in the middle of the 19th century. When he was a young boy in school, he learned a lesson which he never forgot.\nOnce he was called up to recite  in front of the class. When he recited only a few lines, the teacher interrupted with a forceful \"No!\" He started over and again the teacher shouted, \"No!\" Ashamed, Henry sat down.\nThe next boy rose to recite and had just begun when the teacher shouted, \"No!\" This student, however, kept on reciting until he completed it. As he sat down, the teacher replied, \"Very good!\"\nHenry was angry. \"I recited just as he did,\" he complained to the teacher.\nBut the teacher replied, \"It is not enough to know your lesson, you must be sure. When you allowed me to stop you, it meant that you were uncertain, if the world says, No! it is your business to say Yes! and prove it.\"\nThe world will say, \"No!\" in a thousand ways.\n\"No! You can't do that.\"\n\"No! You are wrong.\"\n\"No! You are too young.\"\n\"No! You don't have the education.\"\n\"No! You don't have the ability.\"\n\"No! You don't have the money.\"\n\"No! You can't work it out.\"\nAnd each \"No!\" you hear has the possibility to weaken your confidence bit by bit until you give up all together.\nWhen the world says, \"No!\" to you, you should be strong-minded to say, \"Yes!\" and prove it.", "id": "middle6928.txt"}
