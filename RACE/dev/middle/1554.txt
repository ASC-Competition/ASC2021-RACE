He loved a beautiful sports car for many months, and knew his father could well afford it for him. He told his father all that he wanted.\nAs the graduation day was coming near, Peter had got nothing from his father. On the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his study. He told his son how proud he was to have such a good son, and told how much he loved him. Then he gave his son a beautiful gift box. He opened the box, finding a lovely book, a Bible , with the young man's name in it. Angrily he raised his voice to his father and said, \"With all your money you give me a Bible?\" He then ran out of the house, leaving the Bible.\nMany years later, Peter was very successful in business. He had a beautiful house and a wonderful family. Realizing his father was old, he thought he should go to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Unfortunately, he was told that his father had died.\nWhen he reached his father's house, he began to take care of his father's papers. And then he found the Bible, just as he had left it years ago. With tears, he opened it and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, from the back of the Bible dropped a car key. That was the key to the sports car he wanted so much. Sudden sadness and regret  filled his heart.\nSometimes we don't realize the good luck that we already have because we don't know the gift box is packed in a different way. The gift box may be the door to happiness. It is just waiting for us to open.", "id": "middle1554.txt"}
