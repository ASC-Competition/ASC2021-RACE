Why do some of the things around us look red, some green, others blue?\nColors are really made by deflected   light. We see color because most of the things reflect light. In the same way, if something is green, it reflects most of the green light. If something reflects all light, it is white. If it doesn't reflect any light, it is black.\nSome of the light is reflected and some is taken in   and turned into   heat  .The darker the color is, the less light is reflected, the more light is taken in. So dark-colored clothes are warmer in the sun than light-colored clothes.", "id": "middle13.txt"}
