But now, a European country is trying to change that by building schools that have no classrooms, no subject lessons and best of all, no grades.\nThe idea behind the special school is that children are creative. And researchers also think that kids' learning and ideas are as important as those of the CEO of Google, so why not give them a similar environment? Kids may be successful in such an environment.\nTo make kids more creative, the schools are built with special learning areas instead of traditional classrooms. And even the lessons are taught in a special way, with mobile phones and computers.\nThere is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" kind of education. The school believes that everything is a learning experience, whether it is about a serious science project or making a movie inside the school's recording studio.\nOne of the special schools opened in August, 2011. It has five learning areas. The Cave is a secluded place where students fix their attention on individual   projects without being bothered  . The Lab is a place where students can do all kinds of experiments and test their ideas. Kids can work in groups in the same projects in The Camp Fire. The Show Off is where kids can show their inventions. And if the kids need a rest, they can visit The Watering Hole, which has all kinds of fun activities.\nSounds great? And the coolest thing is that the school is free! I hope more schools like this will appear in the world!", "id": "middle2356.txt"}
