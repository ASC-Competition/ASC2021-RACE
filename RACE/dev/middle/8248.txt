One afternoon I was coming home from a friend's house. It was just after four o'clock. I got quickly into the lift and pressed Button12.\nThe lift started to go up, but very slowly . And then, half way up, it suddenly stopped between two floors. I couldn't understand it. I pressed all the buttons from 1to 14. I called for help very loudly. But nobody answered.\nThen suddenly the light went out, and I was alone in the dark. I started to cry and beat the walls of the lift. I cried and cried until I had no voice left. Then, I felt hopeless, and pressed all the buttons with my open hands. And all at the same time, there was a bell far away . It rang and rang. It was the fire alarm . I thought the whole building was on fire. I said to god quietly, \"Just get me out of here. I'll never be bad again.\"\nJust then, I realized the lift was moving very slowly . On the ground floor it stopped, and the doors opened. A man was standing there. \"How long have you been there? It is good that you pressed the alarm bell. But haven't you learned to read at your school?\" He pointed at a small piece of paper on the wall beside the lift. It said: \"Attention: This lift will be stopped for repairs between 4pm and 5pm on Thursday March 13.\"", "id": "middle8248.txt"}
