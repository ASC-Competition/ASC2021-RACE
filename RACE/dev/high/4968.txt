Jennifer Funkhouser, academic adviser for the Department of Rangeland Ecology and Management, directs this four-week summer program designed to increase understanding of research and its career potential.\nSeveral considerations go into selecting students, including grades, school involvement and interest in science and agriculture. And many students come from poorer school districts, Funkhouser says, \"This is their chance to learn techniques and do experiments they never would have a chance to do in high school.\"\nWarner Ervin of Houston is interested in animal science and learned how to tell male from female mosquitoes .His adviser, Craig Coates, studies the genes of mosquitoes that allow them to fight against malaria and yellow fever. Coates thought this experience would be fun and helpful to the high school students.\nThe agricultural research at A&M differs from stereotypes. It's \"molecular science _ ,\" Funkhouser says. The program broadened students' knowledge. Victor Garcia of Rio Grande City hopes to become a biology teacher and says he learned a lot about chemistry from the program.\nAt the end of the program, the students presented papers on their research. They're also paid $600 for their work-another way this program differs from others, which often charge a fee.\nFourteen students got paid to learn that science is fun, that agriculture is a lot more than milking and plowing and that research can open many doors.", "id": "high4968.txt"}
