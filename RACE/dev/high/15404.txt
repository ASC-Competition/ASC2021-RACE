Scientists have shown a new threat from this lifestyle that they call  \"muscular inactivity  \".\nSitting still for long periods of time leads to the buildup of substances   in the blood that are harmful to health. And exercise alone won't drive them away.\nMillions of people spend their days between car,office desk and the sofa in front of the TV. While the bad influences are well rocognized,it has been thought that they can be changed by regular trips to the gym or swimming pool.\nNow researchers say that is not enough. In addition to regular exercise,office workers need to keep moving while they work,by making regular trips to the printer,coffee machine or to chat with workmates.\nElin EkblomBak,an expert on health,says research shows long periods of sitting and lack    of \"whole body muscular movement\"  are strongly linked to obesity,heart disease and cancer,and a higher risk of death,regardless of   whether they take enough exercise.\n\"Everyone knows about the health benefits of regular exercise.

It is not difficult but sometimes you get lost in your work and you forget about it.\"\nHowever,more studies are needed to confirm the ill effects of sitting for too long and ways of fighting them. But at present they conclude that  \"keep moving\"  should be added to the advice to \"keep exercising.\"", "id": "high15404.txt"}
