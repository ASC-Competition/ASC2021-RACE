Zip is a sheep dog. But when Tom tries to say \" Sheep\", it comes out \"keep\". And in a way Tom is right. Zip is always bringing things home for us to keep! I'll tell you about some of them. Zip's first present was a shoe. It was made of green silk. We didn't know how Zip found the shoe. But after a moment, Mary, my big sister, told me the shoe had a strange smell. I nodded  and held my nose. \"What do you think it is?\" \"It smells like something for cleaning. I think someone tried to clean a spot   off the shoe. Then he put it at the door to dry.\" Along came Zip. And good-bye shoe!\" I said. \"We should take it back.\" \"We can't\".said my sister. \"Maybe little Tom is right,\" Mary said. \"Maybe Zip is a _ dog!\"", "id": "high14600.txt"}
