Most countries, including the United States, have used a measure called the gross national product  or GNP. It includes all goods and services produced by citizens of the country anywhere in the world.\nRecently the American Commerce Department has started using a new method to measure production. It is known as the gross domestic product or GDP. It counts only goods and services that have been produced within the nation's borders. Money earned by foreign companies operating in the United States is included in the GDP, but money earned by American companies operating in other countries is not.\nEconomic experts generally approve of the change. They say that the gross domestic product provides a truer measure of the economy. They also note that most other industrial countries use this method. Therefore it will be easier to study the economies of different countries. Some officials also hope the new system will help them make better economic policy decisions. It will provide them with a clearer understanding of economic activity in the U.S. . The new measure is less likely to be affected by sudden changes in foreign oil prices or in the value of the American dollar in other countries.\nEconomic experts believe that the change from GNP to GDP will immediately reduce the value of American production by at least 40,000 million dollars a year. But that is really a very small change in the American economy - less than 1% . The Commerce Department reports the unofficial gross domestic product once every three months. The government also continues to report GNP as it has four times a year since 1941.", "id": "high6064.txt"}
