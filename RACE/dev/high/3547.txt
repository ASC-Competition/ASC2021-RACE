They are absolute opportunists (especially when it comes to rewards). They defend their territory . And in general, they don't like cats. Perhaps that explains a new survey showing that millionaires are far more dog-friendly than the rest of Americans.\nAccording to a study by Spectrem Group, 58% of millionaire pet owners have a dog. Only 37% own a cat. Only 3% keep fish, 2% birds and 2% have a horse. Similarly, 39% of U. S. households own a dog, compared to 33% of households owning a cat, released by the Humane Society.\nJennifer Cona, a trust and estates attorney  and partner with Genser Subow Genser & Cona in New York, does a lot of work on pet trusts. She said of all the pet trusts she's worked on, 90% are for dogs and only 10% are for cats.\nShe said dogs provide one thing especially important for the wealthy: unconditional love.\n\"You don't get that from a cat,\" she said, \"Dogs are like children for some families, except that they don't mess up in college or run off with money. Sometimes it's easy to see why dogs are the favorite children.\"\nMillionaires show their love for their dogs in part by their spending. One quarter of millionaire pet owners spend more than $1, 000 a year on their pets, the Spectrem study said, while more than half spend more than $500 a year.\nMany would say those numbers are understated, given all the diamond-dog collars, dog foods and booming dog spas in evidence these days, not to mention the medical bills.\nThe survey showed 34% of pet owners spend money on decorating, while 6% spend on \"sweaters, outfits and costumes.\"\nMore than half of millionaire pet owners spend money on teeth cleaning for their pets. More than 16%, meanwhile, said they would spend money on reconstructive surgeries and \"anti-anxiety, anti-depression\" medication for their pets.", "id": "high3547.txt"}
