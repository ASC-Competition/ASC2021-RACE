But experts now believe that almost 50 percent of occupations existing today will be completely unnecessary by 2025 as artificial intelligence continues to change businesses.\n\"The next fifteen years will see a revolution in how we work, and a revolution will necessarily take place in how we plan and think about workplaces,\" said Peter Andrew, Director of Workplace Strategy for CBRE Asia Pacific.\nA growing number of jobs in the future will require creative intelligence, social skills and the ability to use artificial intelligence.\nThe report is based on interviews with 200 experts, business leaders and young people from Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. It shows that in the US technology already destroys more jobs than it creates.\nBut the report states: \"Losing occupations does not necessarily mean losing jobs -- just changing what people do.\" Growth in new jobs could occur as much, according to the research.\n\"The growth of 20 to 40 person companies that have the speed and technological know-how will directly challenge big companies,\" it states.\nA 2014 report by Pew Research found 52 percent of experts in artificial intelligence and robotics were optimistic about the future and believed there would still be enough jobs in the next few years. The optimists pictured \"a future in which robots do not take the place of more jobs than they create,\" according to Aaron Smith, the report's co-author.\n\"Technology will continue to affect jobs, but more jobs seem likely to be created. Although there have always been unemployed people, when we reached a few billion people there were billions of jobs. There is no shortage of things that need to be done and that will not change,\" Microsoft's Jonathan Grudin told researchers.", "id": "high14410.txt"}
