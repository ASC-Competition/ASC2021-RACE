To reduce the hunger that prevents learning and to encourage parents to send their children to school, meals are provided by the World Food Programme.\n\"We are so cut off that we have many difficulties,\" comments Emile, adding that finding chalk, school books and other materials is practically impossible.Emile tries to encourage people around her to make use of available resources.Her efforts are bearing fruit.One of her successes was convincing local women to contribute to their children' s schooling and increase their income by selling embroidery  and other handicrafts.\nRecent political instability has meant that the country has not invested   in education for ten years.Only 44% of children go to school and less than half of them finish primary school. Less than a third of these children go on to secondary school.In rural areas it is not rare to find 17 and 18 year olds in primary school- Beau-Roc has only 4 teachers for 260 pupils.Emile works constantly to improve her pupils' environment.Under her direction, a local worker is now constructing a store house for the food delivered regularly by the WFP.\nNot only is Emile' s salary small, but she receives it irregularly.For her, transport is a real headache.She lives five kilometers away and has to take the tap tap, a privately-owned bus, costing more than she can afford.\n\"The decision to be a rural teacher in Haiti should not be taken lightly\" , Emile comments. \"With all the sacrifices and risks it requires, only _ should do it.\" However, Emile loves her job.\"I always feel at home with the children and, because the parents understand what I'm doing, I try to give my best.\"", "id": "high12141.txt"}
