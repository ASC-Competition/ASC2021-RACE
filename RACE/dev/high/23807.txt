It is something far less pleasant , like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this or that , and why you did not do this or that . Sour  music , indeed , but it has to be faced .\nThe phrase \"to face the music\" is familiar to every American , young and old . It is at least 100 years old . Where did the expression come from ?\nThe first information comes from the American writer James Fenimore Cooper . He said--in 1851--that the expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings  to go on stage . After they got their clue to go on , they often said , \"It's time to go to face the music.\" And that is exactly what they did --face the orchestra which was just below the stage .\nAn actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly or perhaps unfriendly , especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out .\nSo, \"to face the music\" came to mean : having to go through something , no matter how unpleasant the experience might be , because you knew you had no choice .\nThe other explanation comes from the army . Men had to face inspection by their leader . The soldiers worried about how well they looked . Was their equipment clean--shiny enough to pass inspection ? Still , the men had to go out , and face the music of the band , as well as the inspection . What else could they do ?", "id": "high23807.txt"}
