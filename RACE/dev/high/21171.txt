But that's not her way. Five years after losing her vision, Clements is back doing what she loves. \n\"It is long, Kathy,\" Clements says, running her hands down the length of her client's hair. Kathy Braga is letting it grow. It now hangs below her shoulders and down her back, and all she wants is a trim , so she asks Clements to show her how much an inch would be. Clements pulls a ruler from a drawer and holds it up to Braga's hair in front near her face. \"Right here. An inch will be right here at your chin.\"\nClements was in this career for about 10 years before losing her vision. Now, when she begins cutting, it's easy to forget that Clements is completely blind. She carefully compares the length of each strand of hair. Though confident of her sense of touch, she at times asks her client to be her eyes and check her work.\nAfter a careful inspection, Braga gives her approval. And after Clements blows her hair dry, she remarks, \"You made me younger. I love it.\"\nClements had been doing Braga's hair for years before she became blind. Braga is proud to say she was Clements' first customer after she lost her vision.\n\"She sat me in the kitchen. It was dark, and she said ,' Are you ready?' I said, 'I'm ready.' And that is when she took this thing, and she said, ' Look and see if there is hair on the ground,' and I said ,' Yes, there is .' And she said, 'Okay, I have the right end of the thing.\" \nClements was 42 years old when she suffered a pulmonary embolism   that cost her sight. \"I was dead for 20 minutes first and then half an hour, and the lack of oxygen killed my optical  nerve.\" The last thing Clements remembered that day was the ambulance coming to get her. \"I couldn't breathe. The next thing I remembered was waking up three days later, blind, in the hospital.\"\nHer ribs had been broken, when they treated her. Her shoulder was dislocated. She had to undergo nine months of physical treatment.\n\"It was the hardest time in my life,\" she says. \"Everything changed in my life: distance, smell, and sound. My kids didn't sound the same. My husband didn't sound the same too. I didn't know my home. It took me three months to find the coffee table.\"\n Once a month, a teacher from the Virginia Center for the Blind came to her home in Woodbridge, about 40 kilometers from Washington. But Clements was eager to learn more. So in 2008, she left her husband and sons, to go to the Virginia School for the Blind in Richmond for a nine-month program. \"My plan was to be able to do for my family again, to do what I like to do, cook, clean, make phone calls.\"\n She learned basic skills like how to walk with a cane, how to listen and how to eat different foods. There were classes in Braille, computer skills and using different gadgets designed for the blind. Graduates of the program are expected to leave with not only life skills, but a marketable skill as well.\n\"My teacher asked me why I wouldn't do hair. I said, ' Hello. Blind. No, no, no.' I was scared  to think I could even do it.\"\nBut gradually, Clements gained confidence and by the time she graduated, had styled 100 heads of hair at the school. \"People from headquarters came, people from the library, students, secretaries, teachers, and friends came. Everybody came and let me do their hair,\" Clements says.\nThree days a week she leaves home to volunteer at the House of Mercy, a Catholic service organization that provides clothing, food and other support to the poor.\nKellie Ross, executive director of the House of Mercy, remembered when Clements first showed up with her friend, Kathy Braga, to offer her help.\nAt first, she had no idea Clements was blind. \"As she started to walk I realized she couldn't see, \" Ross recalls. \"She could have taken that tragic experience of losing her sight and gone inward, but instead she used that experience to help other people who are suffering.\"\nClements says she feels blessed to day, five years after her brush with death. \"I thank the Lord every day for my blindness, because I'm alive,\" she says. \"I could have been dead. I'm alive. I'm healthy, and that is what matters.\"", "id": "high21171.txt"}
