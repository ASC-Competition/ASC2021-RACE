While calming myself down with soft music, I started to recall what happened in the daytime and wrote it down.\nThe accident that gave me much thought happened on my way to the gym after work. When I walked about half way, I saw that many people surrounded something on the roadside and they were worried and shocked. I joined them and found there was a man lying on the ground. I noticed that he was a young man around 30 years old. He looked so pale and very thin. From his dressing, I simply judged that he worked in the office. The hospital ambulance came over and some nurses did the regular check for him. A nurse said that there was nothing serious with him but his body was very weak, which should be caused by overwork and less exercise.\nIt's a really sad thing for a young person to fall down in the street. A couple of days ago, I read a magazine mentioning that there is an increasing number of businessmen and white-collar workers with unhealthy bodies. Under huge pressure, they put all their time and energy to work and can't find enough time for a good meal or a good sleep, let alone exercise. But they forget that without health, work is equivalent to zero.\nAs I realize how important it is to put the health matter ahead, I am willing to do more exercise. I know exercise can bring me enjoyment and health. I know without health, even a most successful career and a great quantity of money will lose their meanings. \nWhen I got out of the gym, I felt that every cell in my body was refreshed and I was able to have more energy to write the words above. The feeling in sweat was wonderful!", "id": "high16599.txt"}
