Well, _ Greg is now stuck at home with his family and all this gives him a bad case of cabin fever.\nKinney says that the book is not only about the claustrophobia   of being stuck at home for days without being able to leave, but also about getting stuck with an identity.Sometimes we get stuck a certain way when we are young and it's hard to change people's feelings of us.That's some pretty deep stuff  , but we expect the book to mostly be full of silly and funny stuff that will make us laugh.\nThe first printing of Cabin Fever will print 6 million copies of the book.Many kids who don't like to read like the Wimpy Kid books because of the combination of cartoons, story, and comedy.Cabin Fever, like the other five, will have 224 pages of cartoons and funny events in the life of Greg Heffley as he sits out his holidays snowbound at home.\n    They are generally recommended for kids 8 to 11 years of age, but older kids (even adults) may find them funny as they remember what it was like to be in middle school.", "id": "high22077.txt"}
