It is to be expected that the selections will change with the times. Yet there is a surprising uniformity   in the lists which represent the best choices of any period.\nWhat are the signs by which we may recognize a great book? The four I will mention may not be all there are, but they are the ones I've found most useful in explaining my choices over the years.\nGreat books are probably the most widely read. They are not best sellers for a year or two. They are enduring best sellers. GONE WITH THE WIND has had relatively few readers compared to the plays of Shakespeare or DONQUIXOTE. It would be reasonable to estimate that Homer Iliad has been read by at least 25,000,000 people in the last 3000 years.\nGreat books are popular, not pedantic . They are not written by specialists about specialties for specialists. Whether they are philosophy or science, or history or poetry, they treat of human, not academic problems. They are written for men, not professors. To read a textbook for advanced students, you have to read an elementary textbook first. But the great books can be considered elementary in the sense that they treat the elements of any subject matter. They are not related to one another as a series of textbooks, graded in difficulty or in the technicality of the problems with which they deal.\nGreat books are always contemporary, the most readable and instructive.\nGreat books deal with the persistently unsolved problems of human life. There are genuine mysteries in the world that mark the limits of human knowing and thinking. Great minds acknowledge mysteries honestly.
