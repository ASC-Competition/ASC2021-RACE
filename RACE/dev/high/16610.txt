To do so at 22, like Jennifer Lawrence, is just amazing. Recently, the American star won Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards for her role in the film Silver Linings Playbook. According to time magazine's Richard Corliss, Lawrence is a rare young actress who lends mature intelligence to any role.\nThough Lawrence has found great success through her big screen work, she wasn't sure what she really liked doing before the age of 14. She thought she'd go to college and maybe find a career as a doctor or a travel agent.\nLawrence's two brothers were star athletes and one of them was a straight-A student. Unlike them, she suffered through school, never finding where she belonged. However, during a trip to New York, Lawrence suddenly realized that she wanted to be an actress. When she was enjoying the beautiful city, a model seeker asked if he could take her picture, and the next day he called her in for an audition .\n\"I read the script and it was the first time I had that feeling like I understand this,\" Lawrence said. \"Within 20 minutes in the cab ride from the hotel, I decided I didn't want to be a model.

Rolling Stone called her \"the most talented young actress in America\" .", "id": "high16610.txt"}
