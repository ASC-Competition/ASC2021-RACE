She said, \"I phoned up the Royal Infirmary, it's just across the road.\n\"I went into the bath and realized she was gong to come quickly. I didn't think I'd be able to make it out of the bath, so I phoned the maternity  ward back and told them to get an ambulance out.\"\nThey said they were not sending an ambulance and told me I had had nine months to sort out a lift.\nExperienced mother MS Blake today said she knew she had to get herself out of the bath and try to get to the hospital.\nEventually MS Blake and her friends enlisted the help of a physiotherapist  who happened to be passing on her way to work. She dialed 999 and helped deliver baby Mariah while waiting for emergency services.\nMs Blake said despite the happy ending she was upset she was told to make her own way to the hospital as, being an experienced mum, she knew she did not have the time.\nToday a government spokeswoman said, \"We are disappointed that Ms Blake was not happy with the advice and care she received and will of course investigate any complaint. We are pleased that both Ms Blake and her daughter are well and healthy.\"", "id": "high4931.txt"}
