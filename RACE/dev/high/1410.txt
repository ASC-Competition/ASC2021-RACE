It may cause great damage. So it is wise to learn some simple safety tips to protect yourself or your family members.\n _ items, like those made of glass are easily broken and should usually be placed on a lower surface, near the ground instead of placing them on cupboards higher up. Never place them near your bed, sofas and other furniture where you would be sitting or lying down. When there is a strong movement, these pieces will fall on the floor directly and not on you.\nThere is a strong chance of short circuits   and fire breakouts during an earthquake. Make sure you turn off electrical connections and gas immediately when an earthquake happens.\nDuring an earthquake, lie beneath an object that is not easily damaged. Do not go near objects that could directly fall on you. Never use the elevator to go down. Stay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries happen when people inside buildings try to go out. Use the staircases at all times.\nIf you are outdoors, do not take shelter under a tree, streetlights, electric poles or tall buildings. If you are driving, stop your car and stay in a safe place. Do not park your car under a tree or any tall object.\nIf trapped in debris  , cover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing. Tap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can find you. Use a whistle   if one is available. Never shout for help. Shouting can cause you to breathe in dangerous amounts of dust. Do not light a match because you may burn yourself. Do not move about or kick up dust.", "id": "high1410.txt"}
