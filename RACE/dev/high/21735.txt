The temperature must be between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Coffee must have shade from nearby trees, but it also requires at least two hours of sunlight each day.\nIt was in the 18thand 19thcenturies that coffee seeds from the Middle East were taken to Latin America, the Carribean, and Africa. It spread fast, with demand for the coffee growing in the northern part of the world. Millions of acres of rainforest and jungle were planted with coffee trees. Because of coffee's need for shade and its ability to be grown alongside other crops, the small coffee trees didn't require any forests to be cleared.\nBut this took a bad turn in 1970 when US agricultural scientists decided to develop a new coffee plant that grew only in the full sun. Farmer agreed to grow this new coffee because they could produce five times more coffee than before. With the support of local governments, it isn't difficult to understand why many traditional coffee fields quickly became modern ones. As a result, over the past 40 years, Central America has lost two-thirds of its rainforests at a rate of 40 million acres per year. That figure is similar to Mexico.\nThese modern coffee plantations  are very harmful as nothing can grow in the fields besides the coffee bushes. As the rainforests disappear, so do the animals. Sun plantations also contribute to soil erosion . The coffee trees must face not only the heat with no protection, they must also face heavy rains, which slowly washes much of the soil away. Sun coffee field are actually risky for farmers in the long term.", "id": "high21735.txt"}
