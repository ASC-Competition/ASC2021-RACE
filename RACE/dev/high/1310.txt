Some, however, find that putting one's life online can have a price. The blogs of some students in America were stopped by the government for some time because they posted threatening words to their teachers on their blogs.\nA recent study finds that nearly a fifth of teens who surf the Internet have their own blogs. And 38 % of teens say they read other people's blogs. By comparison, about a tenth of adults have their own blogs and a quarter say they read other people's online magazines.\nWith the development of the Internet, more and more people will be attracted by blogging.\nIn another study, 79% of teens agree that people at their age aren't careful enough when giving out information about themselves online. Besides, careless blogging can also influence blog readers. When you are angry or unhappy, your blog is the first place you turn to. The words you post then may not be _ which you may regret later.
