Curious-looking Sam has racked up 150,000 Instagram followers and 530,000 likes on Facebook since bursting onto the scene in 2012.\nOwner Amanda Collado, 26, from New York, has been handling the large amount of requests from fans and media for the past three years. She said, \"There have definitely been situations where I have had to ignore friends, family or work to take the time to do Sam's posts or answer emails on his behalf. Everyone gets a little annoyed when I'm on my phone and not paying attention to them. I never thought Sam would be so popular.\"\nAmanda's mum, Ivette Rodriguez, noticed the abandoned cat outside her home one evening.\nIvette said, \"I saw a little niche   next to the house and there was a cat in there. He willingly gave himself up to me--I guess he was so tired of being outside.\"\nAmanda created an Instagram account for Sam after a friend pointed out his expressive brows. She said, \"I didn't notice his eyebrows initially.\"\n\"He had about 800 followers at first--but in February someone posted his photo on Reddit and he blew up overnight--I woke up with 1600 followers. From there we made a Facebook and all other social media accounts.\"\nAmanda posts pictures to Sam's account every two days, but spends most of her day keeping up with all of his fans. But the effort she puts into her pet's social media has paid off--and she has bigger plans for Sam's future, including merchandise  .\n\"Right now we're trying to share him in a free way. Eventually we'll sell Sam merchandise, because I know many people do like having cute little mugs, Sam mugs, or posters, T-shirts.\"", "id": "high14933.txt"}
