In the USA the commonest greeting is \"Hi\". In Britain it is \"Hello!\" or \"How are you?\". \"Hi!\" is creeping into British, too. When they are introduced to someone, the Americans say, \"Glad to know you.\" The British say, \"How do you do?\" or \"Pleased to meet you.\" When Americans say \"Goodbye\", they nearly always add, \"Have a good day,\" or \"Have a good trip,\" etc. to friends and strangers alike. Britons are already beginning to use \"Have a good day\". \nThe British usually use \"got\"in the sense of \"have\". The Americans hardly ever do.\nAm.E: Do you have a car, room,etc.?Yes, I do.\nBr.E: Have you got a car, room, etc.? Yes, I have.\nFinally, there are a number of differences between American and British English in the spelling of words, e.g.check(US)/cheque(UK); center(US)/centre(UK). Many American words ending in \"or\", e.g. honor, vigor, labor are spelt in British English with an \"our\", e.g. honour, vigour, labour. Many verbs in American English with \"ize\"or \"izing\" forms, e.g. organize, realizing are spelt in Br.E \"ise\"or \"ising\",e.g.organise,realising.In American English, \"practice\"is used both for the verb and noun.In Br.E, the verb is spelt \"practise\", and the noun \"practice\". In the main, American English  avoids the doubling up of consonants in nouns and verbs while British English does not.In American English, for example, one writes \"travel, traveled, traveling, traveler,\" while in British English, one writes  \"travel, travelled, travelling, traveller\".\nIt was once predicted that British and American English would became separate languages finally. But the opposite has happened. The links between the two countries are so strong that linguistically , and probably culturally too, they are closer together than ever.", "id": "high5270.txt"}
