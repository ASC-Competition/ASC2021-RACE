Submissions can be accepted as a blog post, cartoon, photo, short film or in any other format.\nThe winner with the best submission will receive a 12-day trip to Sweden and Switzerland and will be expected to report back on his/her impressions of both countries following the trip, the website states.  Entries will be accepted until November 20.\nThe organizers have also _ a humorous campaign logo with objects and people associated with Sweden and Switzerland on separate maps of each country.  Sweden's map features meatballs, a Viking, as well as two male cartoon figures with a heart between them symbolizing gay marriage, which remains illegal in Switzerland.  Switzerland's map features cheese, the Alps and a picture of Roger Federer.\nChina may not be the only country struggling to tell Sweden and Switzerland apart.  Residents of Spanish-speaking countries also fall victim to the confusion as Sweden is spelt \"Suecia\" in Spanish while Switzerland is called \"Suiza\".\nSweden and Switzerland aren't the only places that have caused confusion among people.  Last month, , a British holidaymaker hoped to explore the architecture of the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, but instead mistakenly caught a flight across the Atlantic to the tropical Caribbean island of Grenada following a confusing booking blunder.  Earlier this summer, two US holidaymakers were flown to the wrong continent after an airline confused two airport codes.", "id": "high10709.txt"}
