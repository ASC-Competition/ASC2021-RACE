Some were against the idea. At last, the IOC decided to hold Winter Olympic Games in 1916. However, World War I broke out in 1914. After 1920, the national governing bodies for winter sports in several countries began talking about the possibility of a separate Winter Olympics.\nThe town of Chamonix, in the French Alps, planned to hold a winter sports festival in 1924, at the same time Paris was to host the Olympics. The Marquis de Polignac, a member of the IOC, suggested that the festival be formally recognized as the Winter Olympic Games. The IOC didn't go that far, but did agree that Chamonix could call its festival an \"Olympic winter carnival\".\nThe festival drew 258 athletes from 16 countries to compete in bobsledding , figure skating, hockey, Nordic skiing and speed skating. Charles Jewtraw from the United States won the first gold medal, in the 500-meter speed skating, but the festival's hero was Claus Thunberg from Finland. He won five medals, three of which were gold, in speed skating.\nWeather has often been a major story at the Winter Olympics, and so it was at Chamonix. The festival opened with rain and unseasonably warm temperature that turned snow and ice to mud. Then temperature dropped as far as 25 below zero and the mud became ice.\nDespite  the weather, more than 10,000 people showed up. At its yearly meeting in 1925, the IOC recognized the Chamonix festival as the first Winter Olympics and decided that the Winter Games would be held every four years, just like the Summer Olympics.", "id": "high17467.txt"}
