Sometimes I think I'm the only girl who notices these quiet but beautiful things. But if it hadn't been for a crowded restaurant, I wouldn't have ever noticed Valeri.\nValeri was a new student. She walked to class with her books against her chest and her head down. She talked only when the teacher asked her a question. After a month at our school, she hadn't made any friend.\nOne day at lunch, most tables being full, I had nowhere to sit. Valeri sat alone, book in hand. I walked over to her, \"Is that a good book?\" Valeri gave a small nod and went back to reading. \"What's it about?\" I asked. After seconds of silence, she looked at me, her eyes shining, \"Well, it's about a dragon! This boy, Eragon, finds this dragon egg when he goes playing one day. He thinks it's a rock! The egg hatches and Eragon hides the dragon from his cousin and uncle until it gets too big .\"\nTwo weeks later, I was sitting in the auditorium enjoying the talent show. Then a shy girl walked on stage. I recognized her immediately. Valeri held a violin in one hand and a bow in the other. She started to play. The notes formed a soft, sweet tune . The auditorium fell completely silent until we realized the music was finished. I smiled to myself. Valeri wasn't just \"a quiet girl\". She knew about wonderful books and could play the violin like nothing I'd ever heard. Like a butterfly, she was beautiful and amazing when you looked closely.", "id": "high10579.txt"}
