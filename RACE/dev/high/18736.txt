The girl who sits next to him has chosen Peter. \nEnglish is the one lesson I am not trapped with illegible  requests and homework. The kind teacher has decided to let us off this one. \nWith 42 children in a class I have piles of respect for the teachers who sustain their devoted, detailed training of these young minds. \nPerhaps with the homework load they are causing some kind of revenge on the parents who have produced these little charges, and in doing so have caused them all this work.  \nTo my little boy, it's all good fun with a bit of writing and numbers thrown in. \nHe loves most of it, especially the weekly flagraising ceremony, which, while a little surprising to the little ones, is at least accompanied by lively music and bright red flags.", "id": "high18736.txt"}
