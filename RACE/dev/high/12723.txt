The Quad is located right in the heart of Greenwich Village, perhaps the most charming and interesting neighborhood in the city. Here are some attractions we recommend, all within a comfortable walk from the Quad:\nWashington Square\nAs one of the best-known of New York City's 1,900 public parks, it is a landmark in the Manhattan neighborhood of Greenwich Village, as well as a meeting place and center for cultural activity. Come on a Sunday when it's most lively and festive.\nNew York University\nIt surrounds Washington Square. See the impressive Bobst Library and visit the amazing bookstore. NYU is now considered one of the most powerful universities in the world.\nJudson Memorial Church\nLocated on Washington Square south between Thompson Street and Sullivan Street, opposite Washington Square Park, this beautiful church was completed in 1892. The Judson is most famous for its vocal participation in social events.\nWashington Mews\nIt is a hidden, private street in New York City between Fifth Avenue and University Place just north of Washington Square Park. It was first developed as a mews (row of stables) that serviced horses from homes in the area. Since the 1950s the former stables have served as housing, offices and other facilities for New York University.\nJefferson Market Courthouse\nBuilt in 1833 as a market, it was later changed to a courthouse, and in the 1950s it was emptied and close to being destroyed. It was saved and turned into a library. Many consider it to be the most beautiful building in the village.", "id": "high12723.txt"}
