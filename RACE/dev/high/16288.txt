In addition to that, roads, parking lots, and yet more buildings are being constructed. The total lost green space can have a very real effect on a city's air temperature, air quality and energy costs. On a summer day in most American cities, a tar roof can feel like the inside of an oven. But what if we could replace the hot roof of each skyscraper or building in a city with grass or a garden?\nWhether it holds vegetable gardens, wildflowers, or meadow grasses, a green roof can lower the temperature above a building by 60 degrees, which can reduce the building's energy costs. If used more widely, green roofs could decrease a city's total energy costs, reduce polluted air from power plant , and improve air quality and public health. But that's not all -- green roofs are a great way to deal with water management in urban areas with overwhelmed sewerage   systems, and actually extend the life time of the roof itself. And green roofs do something else: They beautify the city -- whether you're on the 3rd floor or the 30th. Now that's a great achievement.\nThe environmental nonprofit group Earth Pledge is promoting a Green Roofs progamme.
