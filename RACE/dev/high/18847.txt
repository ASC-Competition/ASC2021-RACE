Curtis in 1848. In 1850, Curtis began selling flavored gums.\nPizza--In Italy in the early 1700s, flat breads, called pizzas, were made without toppings.These tasty,filling breads were sold to the poor in Naples.When Maria Carolina, the queen of Naples, tasted one, she persuaded her husband, King Ferdinand IV, to allow this peasant dish to be made in the royal kitchen.Almost 200 years later,during her travels around the country, Italy's queen Margherita saw Italian peasants eating pizza breads.She had a taste and fell in love with pizza. She ordered the most famous pizza cook of the day, Raffaele Esposito, to create for her a pizza made of tomato, basil, and cheese to look like the color1s of the Italian flag. This remains the basis of the American version of the pizza.\nThe ice-cream-cone--In 1904, Italo Marchiony got a patent  to produce ice-cream cones. The same year at the ST. Louis World's Fair, a Syrian waffle  seller Ernest Hamwi heard that a nearby ice-cream seller had run out of dishes to serve his cream. Hamwi rolled some of his waffles into a cone  shape and offered them to his neighbor, who put ice-cream in the cones and sold them. This first fully eatable, portable  treat was a hit with customers immediately.\nM&Ms--During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, Forrest Mars, Sr., saw soldiers eating pieces of chocolate covered with a hard sugary coating, which kept the chocolate from melting in the sun.
