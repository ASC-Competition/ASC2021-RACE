In spite of this, he managed to get to the university, but it was so expensive to study there that during the holiday he found it necessary to get two jobs at the same time so as to make enough money to pay for his studies.\nOne summer he managed to get a job in a butcher's shop during the day-time, and another in a hospital at night. In the shop, he learnt to cut meat quite nicely, so the butcher often left him to do all the serving  while he went to the back room to do the accounts . In the hospital , on the other hand, he was , of course , allowed  to do the simplest jobs, like helping to lift people and to carry them from one part of the hospital to another. Both at the butcher's shop and at the hospital, Tom had to wear white clothes.\nOne evening at the hospital, Tom had to carry a woman from her bed to the place where she was to have an operation. The woman was already feeling frightened at the thought of the operation before he came to get her, but when she saw Tom, that finished her.\n\"No! No!\" she cried. \"Not my butcher! I won't be operated on by my butcher!\" and fainted away .", "id": "high15572.txt"}
