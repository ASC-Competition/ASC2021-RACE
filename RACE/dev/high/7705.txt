These deaf people were not able to use a spoken language.\nBut, beginning in the 1700s, the deaf were taught a special language. Using this language, they could share thoughts and ideas with others. The language they used was a language without sound. It was a sign language.\nHow did this sign language work?  The deaf were taught to make certain movements with their hands, faces and bodies. These movements stood for things and ideas. A man might move his finger across his lips. This meant, \"You are not telling the truth.\" He might tap his chin (, )with three fingers. This meant \"my uncle\".\nThe deaf were also taught to use a finger alphabet . They used their fingers to make letters of the alphabet. In this way, they spelled out words. Some deaf people could spell out words at a speed of 130 words per minute.\nSign language and finger spelling are not used as much as they once could. Today, the deaf are taught to understand others by watching their lips. They are also taught how to speak.", "id": "high7705.txt"}
