Recently, the staff there got a shock when they came to work in the morning. They found that some of the dogs had got out of their kennels  during the night, opened cupboards and taken out food and toys. And it happened again and again. The manager described how as many as nine dogs were escaping every night. \" When we came in, dogs were running around having fun and causing a lot of mess. \"\nSomeone or something was unlocking   the kennels during the night. The manager decided to put in cameras to record how the dogs were getting out.\nWhen she and her staff played back the recording, they saw Red, a three-year-old dog, put his nose through the bars of his kennel and use his teeth to press the button  that opened his door. That was clever enough, but Red did more: he unlocked the kennels next to his and let the dogs out too. The group broke into cupboards and stole dog biscuits and toys to play with.\nThe manager said, \" It's surprising that Red _ how to open his own kennel and let all his friends out.\" I suppose, Red didn't like to party alone.\nThe story has a happy ending: after Red was shown on TV, several people came and offered to give him a new home as a family pet.", "id": "high8527.txt"}
