Therefore, flower as a gift was an effective tool in social communication. With so many choices today, we have no rules in flower choosing. However, people tend to give a certain flower their own personal meaning--- maybe it can remind them of some particular friends or events. Here I would introduce the traditional meanings of some gift flowers as a reference for your flower choosing.\nCarnation  is a good gift for your female teacher or mother, but not all kinds of carnations men respect and love. Different colours have different meanings. Generally, carnation means \"fascination and woman love\". Specifically, pink carnation means \"I'll never forget you\" and red carnation says \"I admire you\". But some carnations have very negative meanings. If you want to say goodbye to your girlfriend, you can send her a bunch of striped carnations or yellow ones, because it means \"Sorry I can't be with you. You disappointed me.\"\nRose is no doubt the best gift for girls in love. Basically, it relates to the love between men and women, but roses with different colours stand for different stages of love. Red rose is man's best friend when he wants to show his love to a girl. In the peak of his love, pink rose is more suitable because it means \"perfect happiness and please believe me\". While the love gets into trouble, yellow rose seems to be the best symbol. It means \"the decrease of love and jealousy\".\nThough you are free to choose any kind of flower as long as it is beautiful, I think this breif introduction can help you avoid making mistakes. Besides, the receivers must be happier if he or she gets to know the good will you convey in flowers.", "id": "high19286.txt"}
