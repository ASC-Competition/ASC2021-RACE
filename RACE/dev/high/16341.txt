We have instant satisfaction, fast food, speed reading, mobile phones; even the stress management books have titles like \"Stress Management in 60 Seconds\".\nCanadian Classics Professor Margaret Visser points out that the perception that we have \"no time\" is one of the most strict concepts of Western culture. Visser says that \"no time\" is used as an excuse and also as a spur ; it both stimulates us and forces us, just as a concept such as 'honour' did for the ancient Greeks. According to Visser, the feeling that Westerners have \"no time\" is abstract, quantitative, amoral , unarguable, bringing pressure on each person as an individual. At the same time, the \"no time\" excuse escapes\nby claiming to be a condition created entirely out of our good fortune.\nLife offers \"so many pleasures, so many choices\".\nThe fact that women now work outside the home has contributed to the \"no time\" trend. But more important, Visser says, is the fact that feeling rushed has become an important component  of our economy. Marketing of \"time-saving\" products causes people to buy more and work longer. So we eat out or buy prepared food to save time. The fax-it-to-my-car technology only contributes to the constant hurry. In our rushed and exhausted state, even the obligation  to sit down to casual meal with family seems like a pressure. In comparison with the decision to act on a sudden whimz   to consume a microwave mug of soup, the act of eating together and not getting up from the table until everyone else has finished seems an incredibly time-consuming event. Being in one's own personal hurry in the West is somehow \"free and preferable\"", "id": "high16341.txt"}
