Now we have 6montholds in music classes and swimming classes. Parents fear that if other children are attending these classes,they will be holding their own children back if they do not enroll,too.\nThe other extreme,simply taking a laissez-faire approach and letting children do--or refuse to do--whatever they want,is not the answer either,of course.\nDr Taylor emphasizes that parents need to push their children based on what is best for the children,not what is best for themselves. If children understand that an activity is in their best interests,then they will accept it,he finds.\nDr Taylor and other family experts remain pessimistic  about the possibilities for widespread social change. \"The force of our popular culture,driven by money and superficial   values,cannot be resisted,\" he says. But change can take place at a \"microlevel\",in families and schools.\nWhen changes do occur,the rewards can benefit everyone in the family. One mother supporting this new approach toward parenting mentions the advantages her family experienced after her children cut back on activities. \"The biggest thing is that since we have done this,we are rested,\" she says. \"Not only are our kids rested,because they're not in a ton of stuff,but my husband and I are rested,because we're not driving them everywhere. We weren't living in the moment when we were always busy. We were living by the schedule. The return on our investment of spending time together has been enormous.\"", "id": "high17078.txt"}
