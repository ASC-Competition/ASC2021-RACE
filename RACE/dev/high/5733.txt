It was an extremely uncomfortable arrangement to be looking straight into the eyes of a stranger. My husband and I pulled out books. The woman produced a large makeup case and made up her face. Except for a lunch break, she continued this activity for the entire three-hour trip. Every once in a while she surveyed the car with a bright-eyed glance, but never once did she catch my eye. _ .\nI was amused, but some people would have felt uncomfortable , even repulsed .there is something about making up in public that calls up strong emotional reactions. Partly it's a question of hygiene. And it's a matter of degree. Making up --- a private act--- has a way of neglecting the presence of others. I was once seated at a party with a model-actress who immediately waved a silly brush and began dusting her face at the table, demonstrating that while she was next to me, she was not with me.\nIn fact, I am generally prohibited from making up in public, except when I am in the company of cosmetics moment. In a gathering more professional than social, I would do so.\nKathy Peiss, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst says that nose-powdering in the office was an occasion for outrage in 1920's and 30's. Deploring the practice as a waste of company time, trade journals advises managers to discourage it among workers. Peiss theorizes that it was female's making up in what has been an all-male field that disturb some gentlemen.\nPeiss tells me that after the 30's , pulling out a make-up case was no longer an issue. It became an accepted practice. I asked if she feels free to apply lipstick at a professional lunch herself. Sounding mildly shocked, she says she would save that for the privacy of her car afterward. Why? Because it would be \"a gesture of inappropriate feminity .\" One guess is that most professional women feel this way. There is evidence of the popularity of the new lipsticks that remain in place all day without retouching.", "id": "high5733.txt"}
