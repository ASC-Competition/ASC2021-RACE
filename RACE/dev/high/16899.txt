I was mad at Mom for divorcing Dad.\nI kept looking at the telephone until I couldn't stand it any longer. I picked up the receiver and dialed Dad's number over in Bakersfield. I even remembered to dial 1 first because it was long distance. \"You promised to phone me this week but you didn't,\" I said, feeling I had to talk to him.\n\"Take it easy, kid,\" he said. \"I just didn't get around to it. I was going to call this evening. The week isn't over yet.\"\nI thought about that.www.ks5u.com\n\"Something on your mind?\" he asked.\n\"I hoped you would call, so I waited and waited.\" Then I was sorry I said it.\n\"There was heavy snow in the morning,\" he said, \"I had to chain up on highway 80 and lost time.\"\nI know putting chains on eight big wheels in the snow is no fun.I felt a little better, as long as we were talking. \"How is Bandit?\" I asked.\nThere was a funny silence.

I have sent out a call to CB radio, but I didn't get an answer yet.\" I was about to say I understood when there came the bad part, the really bad part. I heard a boy's voice say, \"Hey, Bill, Mom wants to know when we're going out to get the pizza?\"www.ks5u.com", "id": "high16899.txt"}
