And I don't say that to in any way reduce your problems. I just don't want you to think that you're the one person in the world who's stuck with a neurotic   mom. Think about it: for most of the past 14 years, you have depended on your mother for every little thing you've ever needed. Now suddenly you're putting up all sorts of boundaries because you're growing out of being that little kid who needed her for everything, and it's hurting her feelings. What we need here is a little understanding and some new rules to take into account the changes you're going through. You can't just stop sharing things with your mom. It's mean. \nSo why not make a point of telling her some things about what's going on with you every day? She wants to feel that she's still a part of your life. And after consistently doing this for about a month, why don't you tell her where you'd like a little privacy  -- maybe there are certain things you don't want her to always ask about? Promise her that whenever there's an update on those topics, you will completely let her know. And follow up on it!\nThe bottom line is that you guys need to build a new relationship based on the young woman. The only way to do this is to work through some really uncomfortable moments and big fights and then come up with a solution, which is what you're doing now. So don't worry -- it's all going to be okay. But it will take some work, honesty and communication to get there. \nHaving a good relationship with your mom is a really important thing. She's the one person who will always be on your side.", "id": "high18107.txt"}
