But the small dot on the world map has since developed into one of the richest nations thanks to its founder and first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the father of the state, who passed away on March 23, 2015 at the age of 91.\nLee grew up in a Singapore that was part of the British Empire. As a law major who graduated from Cambridge University and the founder of the People's Action Party, he became Singapore's first prime minister in 1959 when British agreed to the island's self-rule.\nLee was a leader with vision . He knew that without agriculture and natural resources, Singapore could only find a way out by developing itself into a place perfect for business. So he began with a few simple ideas: Singapore needed respect for elders and the law, hard work, and the idea that the needs of society are greater than the individual's. He united Chinese, Indians and Malays, making English a common language. He fought corruption and even banned chewing gum. That helped change Singapore from a poor city in the 1950s to a world business center with a GDP per-capita of $ 55,000, reported the Financial Times.\nLee left the office of prime minister in 1990 but remained a member of parliament. He resigned as \"Minister Mentor\" in 2011. He was happy with his work: \"I have no regrets. I have spent my life, so much of it, building up this country. There's nothing more that I need to do.\"\nTo the world, Lee was one of Asia's most popular politicians. He was one of the first to spot the potential of China under a former leader Deng Xiaoping and contributed to China's reform and opening up. \"No small number of this and past generations of world leaders have asked for his advice on governances and development,\" said US President Obama. \"Lee is a visionary and a true giant of history.\"", "id": "high18782.txt"}
