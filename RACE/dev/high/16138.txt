Caring people who I have turned to in difficult times helped me the most by listening and asking about my feelings.\nDuring one of my volunteer jobs at a local HIV and cancer clinic, I found the helpfulness of empathic   listening. As a volunteer I was providing emotional support for people with health related problems. Empathic listening really made a difference on how patients felt about their health problems. By sharing about their pain and suffering and my willingness to listen, they felt less alone.\nWe can make life easier for each other by becoming a better listener and encouraging each other to share our feelings. We can become a better listener by avoiding giving advice and trying to solve problems unless we are asked to do so. Pressuring others to solve their life problems--\"our ways\"-- is not helpful. Most people intuitively   know how to solve their own problems. As a listener it's important to be patient and not to interrupt the speaker. Let them know it's OK to talk about their feelings and support them in feeling their feelings.\nWhen one neither shares nor reaches out for support, he or she can remain a lonely mystery. Life can feel lonely when one keeps everything inside. Feeling alone with life problems can be worse than the problem itself. When we let a caring person listen to our life struggle, we will no longer feel alone with our struggle. Don't be afraid to ask your loved ones to take time to hear you out .Sometimes you have to ask for it. People cannot read your mind. Confiding in others can have a positive effect on our mood.", "id": "high16138.txt"}
