It also determines whether the camera can electronically put the details it captures bigger enough to see--which is what makes the pictures not clear enough to see when you view the photos on a bigger screen.\nPortability\n\"The important thing is that the camera isn't too big or heavy,and that you have a good zoom   range for both wide-angle and telephoto shots  ,\"Atherton told CNN.A good choice would be a slim,light pocket camera with a high-qualified built-in optical zoom. \"These are very popular for travel as they are light,but built with a telephoto lens that can zoom up to 60 times,\" Atherton said.\nZoom and shutter   speed\nFor action or crowd shots,a fast shutter speed is a key factor. \"When dealing with anything that's active--wildlife or people in action on the street--faces change within a tiny part of a second,\" said Arnold,\"a fast shutter speed is helpful in shooting the several hundred photos you might need to get that single winning shot.\"", "id": "high15028.txt"}
