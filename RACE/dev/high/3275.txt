PSY made the announcement on his Twitter page earlier today.\nSince its release, the song has defeated such other popular videos as Jennifer Lopez's 'On the Floor' and Eminem's 'Love the Way You Lie'. And in September, 'Gangnam Style' also became the most liked video on YouTube, now with nearly 5.4 million thumbs up.\nAt the time of the announcement, the Guinness Book of World Records released a statement saying: \"In years past it was unthinkable that something would be viewed a hundred million times, and now Gangnam Style has achieved more than twice this figure in just three months on YouTube. PSY, your certificate is waiting here at our office, come pick it up any time!\"\nDespite its massive popularity, the video shows no signs of slowing down, and it even has a shot at becoming the first video to get more than one billion views.\nIf it maintains its current rate of around six million new views per day, 'Gangnam Style' would be in line to break that record by the end of the year.\nThe YouTube honors are just the latest in a long list that shows just how popular the song has become. Since it was released in July, the song has seen a meteoric rise through the music industry.\nIt has found its way to the tops of music charts in more than 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and Canada, while providing material for thousands of parody videos.\nIt became part of the 2012 presidential elections with the now famous 'Mitt Romney Style' video and was even used by the North Korean government in propaganda films promoting their supreme leader.\nMeanwhile, such influential figures as President Obama, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt have all made mention of the hit song.", "id": "high3275.txt"}
