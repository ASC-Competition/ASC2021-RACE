One day while working at the cash register   in the gift shop, I saw an elderly couple come in with a little girl in a wheelchair.\nAs I looked closer at this girl, I saw that she was kind of set on her chair. I then realized she had no arms or legs, just a head, neck and main body. She was wearing a little white dress with red dots.\nAs the couple wheeled her up to me I was looking down at the register. I turned my head  toward the girl and gave her a wink. As I took the money from her grandparents, I looked back at the girl, who was giving me the cutest, largest smile I have ever seen.\nAll of a sudden her _ was gone and all I saw was this beautiful girl, whose smile just melted me and almost instantly  gave me a completely new sense of what life is all about. She took me from a poor, unhappy college student and brought me into her world: a world of smiles, love and warmth.\nThat was ten years ago. I'm a successful business person now and whenever I get down and think about the troubles of the world, I think about that little girl and the remarkable   lesson about life that she taught me.", "id": "high8614.txt"}
