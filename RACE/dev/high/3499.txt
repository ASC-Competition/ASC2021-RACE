I hope these suggestions can help improve your learning of a foreign language\nTry to set aside some time every day for your study when your brain is at the most time for receiving information. It's better to study for 30 minutes every day than for 3 hours once a week. If you can spare two or three hours a day, break them up into some periods to avoid brain getting tired.\nGo over each lesson several times, perhaps once in the morning, once in the evening and once several days later. Give your brain time to understand the material, but the break between periods of study shouldn't be too long, or you will forget most of what you've learned.\nMake sure you're comfortable with the bases of the language before learning the more advanced knowledge. Without full understanding of basic knowledge such as words pronunciation and spelling, you'll find it very difficult to learn more.\nSetting proper targets is a good way to encourage yourself. You could set yourself a time limit or aim for a certain level.\nOnce you have mastered the bases of the language, learn to apply them to the things that you're interested in. In this way you are more likely to remember the words, phrases and grammatical constructions you meet.\nYou will find that at times you're making rapid progress, while sometimes you seem to stand still or even go backwards. This is normal when learning a language, so don't be discouraged.\nMaking mistakes in a foreign language is nothing to worry about. What matters is getting your message across, not whether you use all the right words, tenses, cases, etc. If you cannot think of the exact words, try using other ones.", "id": "high3499.txt"}
