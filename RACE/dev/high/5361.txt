But when he was dying. I set off for Nebraska to be with him and my family. I stopped for the night at a hotel with a pool, hoping it would relax me.\nThe pool area was empty as I walked into the still water. A man in a bathing suit appeared. He sat on the edge of the pool with his legs moving up and down in the water. He had dark hair and deep brown eyes and smiled. \"Where are you going?\" he asked. When I told him about my father, he asked how we got along. I tried to change the subject, but then for some reason, I told him everything.\nFinally the man said, \"Even with all the trouble, remember, your father still loves you.\" All at once, warm and clear childhood memories came flooding back: Dad running alongside my wobbling bicycle, the proud hug he gave me at my high school graduation, his laugh when I caught him off guard with a tickle . \"Yes, I know he does, \" I heard myself say. And for the first time in years I believed it. The man left, leaving me alone with my comforting thoughts.\nBack in my room, as I went to bed, I decided it was time to forgive my father. Then I wished he'd forgive me too. The phone bell woke me up at 3 am. My sister's voice sent a shiver through me: Dad had just died. I had wanted to see him and make peace. But as sadness was beginning to surround me, I remembered that the man by the pool had already brought Dad and me together.", "id": "high5361.txt"}
