Neither island is very big (only ten miles long) and so all parts of these coasts are easily reached from the main centers -- St. Helier and St. Peter Port. In both these towns and particularly in Jersey's St. Helier are concentrated   the amusements of really big resorts  . The nearness of France gives a continental atmosphere; the weather is far better than that in England. The other three islands, Jethou, Herm and Sark are small and quiet.\nIsles of Scilly\nThe islands are really small and quiet; and the weather is warm but windy. The islands are excellent for those who enjoy exploring   small inlets  , creeks   and bays on foot, or even better in a boat.\nIsle of Wight\nThe island is 24 miles across and therefore quite large. The scenery is good and varied. The resorts are neither overlarge nor showy. The crowds seem content with entertaining but quieter holidays. The island has the best sunshine record in Britain.\nIsle of Man\nAn island with unique atmosphere -- in some indefinable   way it is different from England, Scotland or Wales. Thirty miles long, with good roads and good public transport,the mountains,hills and glens   are easily reached. Douglas is a major British resort and other resorts are lively.", "id": "high9117.txt"}
