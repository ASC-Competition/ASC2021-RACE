But for Santa Claus, and the thousands of fake Santas who impersonate  him every year, the Christmas season is time to get to work.\nAlthough  Santa Claus waits until Christmas Eve to take his famous sleigh   ride, Santa impersonators can be found at shopping malls around America throughout the six weeks leading up to December 25. \"When you see Santa talking with kids at your local mall, that's when you know Christmas really is on the way,\" says Mary Lewine of New York City.\nWith the excitement of Christmas, people often forget about the real people behind the red robes   and white beards, but being a mall Santa. is a tough job. \"There is more to it than just sitting in a chair. There is more to it than just a red suit,\" said Timothy Connaghan, who has worked as a Santa for.38 years. \"Children can really put the wear and tear on you.\"\nA recent survey showed some of the challenges that mall Santas face every year. About 90 percent of Santas claimed that children pulled their beards to see if they were real, and 60 percent said that up to ten kids cough or sneeze on them every day. Even more disturbing, one-third of the Santas admit to having children wet themselves while sitting on their laps.\nSo why would anyone take this job? For Ben Brauch, a retired high school teacher who has worked as a Santa for the last six years, the answer is simple-the children. \"I see maybe 12,000 kids in a six-week period.\nIt's hard work, but it's worth it because you get to play with kids.\" In fact, Brauch loves his job so much that he keeps his white beard long all year.", "id": "high13251.txt"}
