On August 29, she got her answer. While she was driving on a road, a big truck hit its head on a pickup car. The pickup car burst into flames. Kristy rushed out and ran to the pickup. Two farmers, Dean Berhard, 51, and his brother Donald, 44, were inside.\nWhen she got close, Kristy could see the unconscious driver. The other man was under the passenger seat. Kristy says, \"The smells were sickening. I was afraid the truck would blow up and kill us all.\"\nThe driver of the big truck was struggling to open the passenger door, so Kristy rushed to the driver's side. Finally they opened the door. She reached in, seized the driver and , to her horror, felt her hands sink into his chest. She quickly dragged the man to safety on the roadside, then hurried back. As Kristy stared down the ditch   with the passenger, the pickup blew up. She jumped on top of him and they both rolled to safety.\nWhen the police arrived a while later, Kristy started crying, \"I want my mum.\" In fact she cried for the next three months.\nToday the two farmers, each the father of two children, are good friends with Kristy. To show their deep appreciation, they bought her a ring with nine diamonds --one for each member of their immediate families, and ninth for her.", "id": "high3152.txt"}
