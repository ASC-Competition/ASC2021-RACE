It's the only one that can never be true . Today , if a bank statement cheats you out of $ 900 that way , you know what the clerk is sure to say : \"It was a computer error .\" Nonsense . The computer is reporting nothing more than what the clerk typed into it .\nThe most annoying case of all is when the computerized cash register in the grocery store shows that an item costs more than it actually does . If the innocent buyer points out the mistake, the checker , bagger and manager all come together and offer the familiar explanation : \"It was a computer error .\"\nIt wasn't, of course . That high-tech cash register is really nothing more than an electric eye . The eye reads the Universal Product Code--that ribbon of black and white lines on the package --and then checks the code against a price list stored in memory . If the price list is right , you'll be charged accurately .\nGrocery stores update the price list each day--that is , somebody sits at a keyboard and types in the prices . If the price they type in is too high , there are only two explanations : carelessness or dishonesty . But somehow \"a computer error\" is supposed to excuse everything .\nOne reason we let people hide behind a computer is the common misunderstanding that huge , modern computers are \"electric brains\" with \"artificial intelligence.\" At some point there might be a machine with intelligence , but none exists today . The smartest computer on earth right now is no more \"intelligent\" than your average screwdriver  . At this point in the development of computers  the only thing any machine can do is what a human has instructed it to do .", "id": "high22976.txt"}
