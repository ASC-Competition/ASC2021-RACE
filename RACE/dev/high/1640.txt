I decided they must be outside.Why they might be outside at 10:30 on a winter night I had no idea, but it was the only explanation I could come up with.\nFinally, in desperation, I called his girlfriend's house. After what seemed like countless rings, his girlfriend answered.\"Yes,\" she said brightly, \"He's right here.\"\nHe came on the phone.I was not my usual calm, rational self. After all, one of the rules of survival for modern parents is that you can't trust modern teenagers.\"Where are the children?\" I said.He said they were with him.They had done nothing wrong.My son had taken the younger children over to his girlfriend's house just for ice cream and cake.This was too good to be believed. Well, it turns out that I shouldn't have believed it.It was only part of the truth.\nThe following Saturday evening we were at my parents' home, celebrating my birthday.My oldest son gave me the children's gifts.Mounted and framed were a series of lovely color photographs of my children, dressed in their best clothes, and wearing their most wonderful expressions.They are pictures to treasure a lifetime, all taken by the father of my son's girlfriend.", "id": "high1640.txt"}
