Even today, many people in the world go hungry, and even die of hunger. If we are to grow enough for everybody, we have to grow more crops and better crops.\nPlants need the right food in order to grow. In particular, they need three chemical substances   in the soil: nitrogen  , phosphorus   and potassium  . They also need smaller amounts of other chemical substances like calcium. If there is too little of any of these substances in the soil, plants can't grow well.\nWhen a plant grows, it takes up these basic substances from the soil and builds them into itself. If we remove the plant from the soil and use it for food, we are taking some of these substances away, and this means that future plants will find less of them in the soil. In time, the soil would become too poor for plants to grow in it at all.\nTo prevent _  we must put basic substances back. One way of doing this is putting manure   on the soil. This contains the remains of plants that have been eaten, and, if we add it to the soil, we are returning some of the basic substances. In Europe and in prefix = st1 /Japan, manure from animals has for long been used in this way. Unfortunately much of the animal waste inIndiais used as fuel because there is not enough wood to burn. This means there is less manure for the crops.\nEven when we use manure, we can not put back into the soil more of the basic substances than have been taken out. Often the soil does not have enough of them in the first place, and so we must provide extra supplies. We can use chemical fertilizers  . Experiments in Indiahave shown that, if we use a fertilizer containing a mixture of nitrogen and phosphorus, we get half as much rice again from the crops on any one piece of land.", "id": "high18867.txt"}
