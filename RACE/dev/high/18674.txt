She was creative with her teaching styles; every new day she brought a new way of leaning literature, by using a game rap song, and other things.\nI must say, the kids in my class sometimes didn't listen to the teachers carefully, but Ms Petoskey was able to attract their attention. Her literature classroom had bean bags and fun chairs to sit in while we read, and our desks were always set up in special positions--all around the room. It looked messy when you walked in the room, but we liked it! She let us choose who we sat next to, but once we talked too much, she would move us. She allowed us to make her classroom our home.\nShe was passionate   about her job. She let us choose the books we wanted to read next, which made me more interested in books. It wasn't what we had to read, but what we wanted to read. Whenever we would present ideas about literature or poems, her eyes would light up and she would become excited.\nShe always made sure everyone was having fun in her class and brought cakes to the classroom every Friday for our silent reading time. She was patient when we got out of hand (,). She was always cheerful, which made me enjoy coming to school. Ms Petoskey is the teacher I still visit and chat with (even after five years). She is the teacher I can thank for making me enjoy reading!", "id": "high18674.txt"}
