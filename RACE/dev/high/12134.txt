Oceans cover 70 per cent of the surface of the globe and store a thousand times more heat than the atmosphere does. What's newer is the understanding of how this key component  of our climate system responds to global warming.\nA brake on global warming--for now\nOne of the oceans' most important climate functions is absorbing heat and carbon dioxide(CO2), one of the gases that causes global warming. Acting as something absorbing heat, the oceans have absorbed huge amounts of heat and CO2 in the last forty years.\nFujita explains, \"the oceans are saving us from faster climate change--they are putting a brake on the climate system.\"\n\"That's the good news,\" he adds. \"The bad news is that the oceans only slow the atmospheric warming. Once the oceans come to balance with a greenhouse-gas warmed earth, the extreme heat will remain in the atmosphere and things will get much hotter.\" But where and how the oceans release this slowly increased heat is uncertain. And as the ocean stores heat, fragile  underwater ecosystems are struggling.\nThe most recent scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) also notes with concern that the ocean is acidifying  because of increased absorption of atmospheric CO2. and thus causing a threat to shell-forming species.  Sharp increase in CO2 levels will cause further acidification of the ocean.\nCurrents distributing heat\nAnother important role the oceans play is that of distributor . Oceans deliver heat and life-sustaining nutrition around the globe. Just as blood tube bring oxygen and nutrition to cells in the human body, the ocean's currents carry oxygen, nutrients and heat throughout the Earth. The ocean distributes 25 to 50 per cent of energy the planet receives from the sun. For example, the Gulf Stream carries heat across the Atlantic. This warm current gives northwestern European a milder climate that it would normally have so far north. A change to the ocean's circulation patterns could throw Europe into a colder period, even as the rest of the world is experiencing warmer temperatures.", "id": "high12134.txt"}
