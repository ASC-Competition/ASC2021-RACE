The change is bound to take place, but the global warming and climate change are changing the earth's landscape   rapidly,causing panic worldwide.\nExperts say that the Arctic sea ice is melting   quite faster than expected and it can affect not just the region, but Earth in general. A scientist even says that next year, or maybe the year after that, the Arctic will be free of ice.\nPeter Wadhams, a scientist, said that the melting trend led to his statement. \"Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic's summer sea-ice cover. Next year or the year after that, I think it will be free of ice in summer and by that I mean the central Arctic will be ice-free,\" Peter Wadhams, director of the Scott Polar Institute in Cambridge, said in an interview withthe Guardian. \"You will be able to cross over the North Pole by ship,\" Peter Wadhams added. He strongly believes that although some pieces of ice will remain, the Arctic basin may be free of sea ice in the next two years starting in the summer of 2017.\nWadhams' study says that melting sea ice will have a great influence on the planet since the sea ice is more capable of reflecting   sunlight compared to water that can only reflect 10% of the sunlight. Once the sea ice melts, the water can only reflect a small amount of sunlight. This means that the Earth will receive and absorb more sunlight, making the planet even hotter.\nThe year 2016 has already broken records of the hottest temperature ever recorded and the trend doesn't seem to show any decrease in global warming. \"It doesn't look like the ice is healing and growing back,\" Tom Wagner, NASA's manager for cryosphere   research said in a statement.\nLike Wadhams, scientists and researchers all over the world are lecturing around to educate people to help lighten global warming that has already changed the planet's landscape.", "id": "high14948.txt"}
