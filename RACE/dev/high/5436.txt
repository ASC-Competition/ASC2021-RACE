The law--represented by men and women dressed in black uniforms and carrying guns -- is no longer threatening to forcibly separate Schwartz and Bimbo,freeing the l0-year-old deer to the fates   of the surrounding rainforest and its hungry wolves and black bears.\n\"We love each other,\"said Schwartz who turned 70 on Saturday. \"she'll come up to me and she'll kiss me right on the lips,1ike a man kisses a woman''\nFor four days last week,Schwartz' life turned as rocky as the rough logging road that connected her life to the outside world.
