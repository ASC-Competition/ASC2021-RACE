If you do, I'm not alone.\nLive performances at theaters interest different groups of people from rich people to office workers. If you go to any theater and look at its audience, you will find it is made up of teenagers, the elderly and anyone in between. One part of it is due to the marketing and the show itself. For example, Hair isn't going to interest the same audience as My Fair Lady. Another part of it is due to the area in which you live. The Palace Theater in Manchester, for example, interests a more urban  crowd than the Leddy Center in Epping. All of these people have an interest in the magic of live performances and they go to the theater for different reasons.\nThere is nothing better than live theatre performances to increase your cultural awareness   When you go to see a live theater performance, no matter whether it is a musical or a play, you are improving your knowledge of the world around you. Some people go to the theater to have fun and escape their troubles; others, particularly rich people, go to the theater to develop their knowledge of the world around them. Both of them are very good reasons for going to see live theater performances. However, personally, I often go to the theater more to have fun than anything else.\nEveryone has the right to enjoy any performance, whether it's a world-famous performance by the New Hampshire Ballet or a second-rate performance by your local community theater. The main thing to remember is whether you are there to heighten your awareness of the culture or to get away from your problems. You should appreciate the performance for what it is, because too many people these days don't know enough about the arts.", "id": "high13702.txt"}
