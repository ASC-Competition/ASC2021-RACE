Solving it quickly is a terrific conversation starter. I usually ask people to try it first. They just turn the cube over in their hands, not even knowing where to begin. That's exactly what it was like for me to learn how to read. Letters and words were out of order. Nothing made sense because I am dyslexic.\nThe Rubik's Cube has made me believe that sometimes you have to take a few steps back in order to move forward. This was a reflection of my own life when I had to leave public school after the fourth grade. It's embarrassing to admit, but I still couldn't always spell my full name correctly. As a fifth-grader at a new school specializing in what's called \"language-processing disorder\", I had to start over. I then spent the next four years learning how to learn and find strategies that allowed me to return to my district's high school with the ability to communicate my ideas and express my intelligence.          \nNow, I can easily solve the 5x5x5. I discover that just before it is solved, a problem can look like a mess, and then suddenly you can find the solution. Early in my Rubik's career, I became so frustrated that I took the cube apart and rebuilt it. I believe that sometimes you have to look deeper and find answers in unexpected places. The Rubik's cube taught me that to accomplish something big, it helps to break it down into small pieces. I learned that it's important to spend a lot of time thinking, to try to find connections and patterns. I believe that there are surprises around the corner.\nLike life itself, the Rubik's cube can be frustrating puzzle. So everyday I carry a Rubik's cube in my backpack as a reminder that I can achieve my goals, no matter what obstacles I face.", "id": "high17860.txt"}
