The pad is more modern, but the wooden stand is surely the original one.\n    \"I'm just amazed you still have the same stand for holding the pad and pencil after all these years.\" I say to her, \"Can't you afford a new one?\"\n    My mother replies ,\"It works perfectly well.I've always kept the stand in the kitchen.I never knew when I might want to note down an idea, and I was always in the kitchen in those days.\"\nShe smiles and says, \"One day I was cooking and watching baby Pauline, and I had a great thought, but the stand was empty.One of the children must have taken the paper.So I just picked up the breadboard  and wrote it all down on the back.The idea turned out to be really helpful in solving the mathematical problem I was working on.\"\nThis story--which happened before I was born--reminds me how special my mother was, and is, as a gifted mathematician.I feel ashamed that I complain  about not having enough child-free time to work.Later, when my mother is in the bathroom, I go into her kitchen and turn over the breadboards.Sure enough, on the back of the smallest one, are some penciled marks I recognize as mathematics.Those marks have travelled through fifty years, rooted in a cheap wooden breadboard, exhibits at every meal.", "id": "high21540.txt"}
