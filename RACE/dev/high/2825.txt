But as he started the turn, he heard the sound of another car, a blowing horn , and the speeding Chevy hit the driver side of his car. The little Fiat turned over four or five times before it was stopped by a big tree. Luckily, George did not die in the accident, but his recovery was slow and he needed months of physical treatment. He would never be able to race ears now.\nThe accident really changed George's life. He decided there must be some reason he survived, and made up his mind to get his act together and make something out of his life. He decided to go to university and developed an interest in reading and writing. He got on quite well in his studies. He didn't quite forget about racing cars. At that time instead of driving race cars, he began filming them.\nYou may have seen one or all of George Lucas's most famous films from the Star Wars series or the Indiana Jones trilogy. Not only has George produced movies, but also he has helped invent and develop new technologies to modernize the movie industry.\nToday, Lucas, who earns as much as $3.0 billion, is one of the American film industry's most successful directors and producers.", "id": "high2825.txt"}
