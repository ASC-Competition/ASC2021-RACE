Dad was our salesman. He traded our service to neighbors at a low price they could not refuse. My brother and I got $10 per yard. However, I later found out our competitors were charging $ 20 or more for the same amount of work.\nOne afternoon we were cutting our neighbor's yard. When I was finishing up, I was tired and sweaty. I pictured the tall glass of icy drink I would have to cool down soon. I was just about to cut off the lawn mower when I saw Dad pointing to one piece. I thought about the poor change I was getting paid for cutting grass so high that it almost broke the mower. I ignored him and kept walking. Dad called me out, \"You missed a piece.\"\nI frowned  , hoping he would let me slide and go home. He kept pointing. So angry, I went back to cut that piece of grass. I said to myself, \"That one piece isn't hurting anyone. Why won't he just let it go?\"\nBut when I became an adult, I understood his message: When you are running a business, the work you do says a great deal about you. If you want to be seen as a businessman with honesty, you must deliver a quality product. That single piece of grass meant the job was not done.\nOther neighbors took notice of the good work we did and we soon got more business. We started out with one client , but by the end of the summer we had five.\nThe lesson my dad taught me stayed with me: If you say you are going to perform a job at a certain time, keep your word. Give your customers the kind of service you would like to receive. It shows how sincere you are and how much pride you take in your work.", "id": "high9408.txt"}
