Less than a tenth of the people are engaged in agriculture and forestry , and most of the rest live in or around towns,small and large.Here the traditional picture is changing: every small town may still be very like other small towns,and the typical small town may represent a widely accepted view of the country,but most Americans do not live in small towns any more. Half the population now lives in some thirty metropolitan areas(1arge cities with their suburbs, of more than a million people each--a larger proportion than in Germany or England,let alone France). The statistics of urban and rural population should be treated with caution because so many people who live in areas classified as rural travel by car to work in a nearby town each day. As the rush to live out of town continues,rural areas within reach of towns are gradually filled with houses, so that it is hard to say at what moment a piece of country becomes a suburb. But more and more the typical American lives in a metropolitan rather than a small town environment.", "id": "high884.txt"}
