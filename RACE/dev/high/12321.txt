Now, there doesn't seem to be space for them in this world I so intelligently understand.\nPerhaps it's from years of working around sick and often dying children, watching time and time again as a child slips away from the arms of a begging mother. I have stopped hoping as the parents around me hope.\nI recently cared for a patient near the end of his life. Medically speaking, his situation was hopeless, which made me feel helpless and defeated.\nHis mother came in to see him. I had prepared myself to support her, imagining she would crumble   into a pile of tears.\n\"Our God is faithful,\" she said, with a smile on her face and the sunshine of hope in her eyes.\n\"Cancer is faithful,\" I muttered   in my mind.\n\"We still believe he can heal him,\" she continued, as if she had heard what I was thinking.\nI provided updates on his body. In a laundry list of updates, perhaps two things were positive. She thanked me for the information, repeating back the minor positive notes I had given.\nI brcame kind of angry. And I wanted to sak, \"Do you really not understand the gravity   of this illness?\"\nAnd then, yet again, as if she had heard me, she replied with this: A positive attitude gives us power over our circumstances, rather than allowing our circumstances to have power over us.\nI was shocked. Here I was, judging her positive attitude as a fault. I completely disregarded the choice to believe in something more powerful than me, more healing than the doctors on our team. It wasn't blind faith. It was strength and devotion.\nWhen I came out of the room, tears welling in my eyes, I sat at my computer and looked\ndown at a small plate of candies she must have left for me on her way into the room. A hand\nwritten note was laid above them: Kate, your devotion is so appreciated, S.\nS, it is your devotion that I am appreciating today. Because of you, I am begging again to\nbelieve in miracles.", "id": "high12321.txt"}
