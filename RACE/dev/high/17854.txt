He went to college only after the encouragement and support of his older siblings  , who also helped him.\n\"I was born on a rice farm very, very poor,\" Wang told The Wall Street Journal in an interview last year. \"Both of my parents were farmers and they planted rice. Both passed away when I was still very young. I was about 10 years old when my father died, and I was 15 or so when my mother passed away. \"\nHe developed a fascination with batteries back in his university days in the mid-1980s, when he studied metallurgical   physics and chemistry. After receiving a Master's degree, he found a research position at the General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals in Beijing. It was an easy job, but he grew bored and decided to go out on his own just as China's experiment with capitalism   was going on.\nHe established the company that is now BYD in 1995, borrowing $300,000 from a cousin, and started out making batteries for cellphones. Today, the company still makes phone batteries but also produces gasoline- fueled cars that have made BYD a top-10 auto brand in China.\nThe company, listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2002, is also getting ready to sell electric cars to private buyers and launch an all-electric battery car model soon in China. All this has helped BYD attract investors' attention, including from one of Warren Buffett's companies, and has helped enrich Wang as BYD's share price has increased.\nWang's fast climb shows personal struggle is still working in China even as the country faces widening gaps between the haves and the have-nots.\n\"Because I came from a poor background, I knew the only way for me to get ahead was to get good education. I studied very hard.\"", "id": "high17854.txt"}
