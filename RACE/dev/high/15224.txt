Since then I have met a few of my neighbors who are very nice people. For Christmas, I thought I would do something nice for each of the neighbors I know. There were nine neighbors whom I knew by name or spoke with often when I was out in my yard. I knew which houses they lived in.\nI decided to add one more to my list. This lady I decided to add lives down the street from me. I meet her every morning walking to work as I drive down the street. She always smiles to me. But I had no idea who she was and which house she lived in.\nI planned to make small fruit baskets and leave them on my neighbor's front porches  on Christmas Eve. I signed the cards: \"Happy Holidays from 5104 Northumberland Road.\"\nI saved the last for the friendly lady. I finally decided on a house where I met her each morning and guessed that it was hers.\nMy neighbors really appreciated the baskets and would tell me as they saw me in the yard or they would call, and a couple even came by to thank me.\nThis morning I found a small note in the mailbox. It was addressed simply: Resident, 5104 Northumberland Road.\nThe Thank You card really caught me by surprise. I opened it and read the message, \"Thank you for the lovely fruit basket you left on our porch. It was very thoughtful. Richard Kelly passed away last week. He talked a lot about how nice it was that someone remembered him in his time of illness. He really appreciated it.\"\nI had no idea who Richard Kelly was and that he had been seriously ill. I had left that nice lady's basket on his porch by mistake. I wanted to say sorry, but that would be wrong. I believe that Mr. Kelly was meant to have that basket because he was dying. I hate that the nice lady did not get to receive a fruit basket on Christmas, but I believe if she knew what had happened, she would be happy. I feel pleased to have helped Richard Kelly's last days be more cheerful.", "id": "high15224.txt"}
