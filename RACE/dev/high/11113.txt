I also remember loving it while my sister thought quite the opposite--she would _ pour her milk into the sink or water the plants with it! I guess I should thank my mom for making us drink a lot of milk, so rich in calcium , during those important years.\nToday, calcium shortage is one of the main concerns of women in their 30s or even early 20s. The great fear is that when we reach our 50s or 60s, osteoprosis will set in. That is why you can see a lot of advertisements for products supposedly containing a lot of calcium.\nBecause calcium is not that easy to acquire from the food we normally eat, busy women these days should take calcium supplements . There are a lot of different forms of these---calcium carbonate ,oyster shell or bone-meal-based calcium supplements.\nYou have to be careful when choosing which kind to take. This is because calcium is not easily absorbed by the body. So the fact that you are taking supplements doesn't mean that the body is actually benefiting from them. Different supplements may have different instructions on dosage and manner of intake. You can ask your doctor to help you determine which supplement is the best for your needs.", "id": "high11113.txt"}
