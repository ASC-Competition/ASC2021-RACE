That's what some high-tech experts have said ever since computers began appearing in everyone's workplace. If you have ever read a newspaper online, you have experienced a tiny part of what paperless future look like.\n       New technology will certainly continue to revolutionize written communication. But will the use of paper in our everyday lives really disappear anytime soon? Well, don't give up on paper just yet.\n       Paper, an ancient Chinese invention, has dominated  written communication for centuries. Cai Lun, an official in the prefix = st1 /Chinese Imperial Court, is well-known for inventing paper in A.D. 105. This invention changed the world forever.\n       Today, surprisingly, it seems the digital age has actually strengthened the importance of paper. Studies show that paper use has doubled in the last 20 years. People still like to print their longer documents and e-mails. But today's technology is rapidly improving. And efforts toward a paperless world continue.\n       The Internet is clearly one giant step. Many of the publications have created Web sites that offer everything in their paper editions--and even more. Their Web sites can be continually updated as news happens. Other types of material have also fit well into the digital age. Dictionaries and other reference books actually work better in a paperless format. Information published on a Web site or CD-ROM can be kept more current.\n       In addition publishers have begun to produce e-book version of their best sellers. New e-book readers---a simple computer about the size of a paperback book--can store nearly a hundred books. But e-books haven't gained a large following.Readingfrom a computer is simply uncomfortable and paperback books are easier to carry around.", "id": "high17664.txt"}
