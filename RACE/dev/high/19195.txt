He asked how he made decisions and responded,\"lt s important to make good decisions. spend much less time and energy worrying about making the right decision and much more and energy ensuring that any decision I make turns out right. \" \t\nIn fact,before we make any decisions,particularly those difficult ones,we re anxious focus on identifying the \"best\" option because of the risk of being \"wrong\". But a side effect that mindset   is that we pay too much attention to the moment of choice and sight of everything that follows. It~ s what happens next that finally determines whether a decision was \"right\". \t\nAnother aspect of this mindset is that our focus on making the \"right\" decision can easy lead to paralysis (,),because the options we- re choosing among are so difficult rank in the first place. How can we definitively determine in advance what career path will \"the best\",or what job offer we should accept? Obviously,we can''t. \t\nFocusing on the effort after our decision not only helps us succeed,but also reminds us we play a role in every outcome. Our control should be in our day-to-day activrties rather than our one-time decision.", "id": "high19195.txt"}
