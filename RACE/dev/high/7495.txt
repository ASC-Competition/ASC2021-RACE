He climbed Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world.\nErik invented his own method for climbing mountains. He carries two long poles: one to lean on and the other to test the way ahead of him. The climber in front of him wears a bell to guide him. Erik is a good team member. He does his share of the job, such as setting up tents and building snow walls.\nAlthough he could not enjoy the view, Erik felt the excitement of being on the summit of Everest.
