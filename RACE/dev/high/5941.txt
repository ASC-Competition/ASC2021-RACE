You can buy everything there and there are also banks, restaurants and, sometimes, a post office.\nThere are other places in the United States which are called five-and -ten-cent stores because they used to sell things for 5 to 10 cents. Today they sell almost anything and some of the things cost several dollars. Supermarkets are found in all the cities. They sell food and many other goods. You walk around the supermarket, choose the things you want, put them into a special basket prepared by the store and pay for them all together at the door. Supermarkets often stay open later than other stores.\nStores are usually open every day of the week except on Sunday. Some close on Saturdays in July and August.", "id": "high5941.txt"}
