Here we report on three important changes that will have a big impact on our everyday lives in the future.\nThe cashless society\nCash and bank-notes will disappear almost completely. They will be replaced by smart cards, namely plastic cards: microchip processors loaded with some money. When we pay for goods,the shop assistant will put our smart card into a payment terminal and money will come into his card from our card. When all the money is used up,we will be able to reloadit by putting it into a telephone,dialing our bank account and money will be put into the card from the account.\nInteractive telephones\nTalking computers will play an important part. They will recognize speech, ask us what information we need, look through a database,and put the information into speech.If we want to book a flight or pay a bill by phone, we will interact with a talking computer to do so. Human telephone operators will be used only for more complex operations such as dealing with complaints or solving special problems.\nTraffic jams in cities will be reduced because drivers will use electronic route maps to find the quickest route to their destination. Electronic systems will start changing motorists for driving in cities.As soon as motorists have to pay to drive in cities, they will stop using their cars and use public transport instead. Speed control systems will be built into cars. These systems will automatically regulate the speed of the car to take account of traffic and weather conditions and prevent accidents. It will be many years before these changes bring results but when they do,there will be a _ improvement in road safety.\nWith the development of science and technology, more and more advanced things will be invented or created. Life in the future is undoubtedly different from that at the present.", "id": "high1951.txt"}
