Of course, I love him like a brother. I have to because he is my brother. More than that, he is my twin! That's right. Andy and Amy(that's me) have the same curly  hair and dark eyes and equally stubborn character. Yet, though we may look alike, on most issues   we usually take completely opposite positions. If I say day, you can count on Andy to say night.\nJust this week, the hot topic in school was all about the PTA'S proposal  to adopt a school dress principle. Every student would be required to wear a uniform. Uniforms! Can you imagine? Oh, they would be uniforms in color. The dress style would be sort of loose and free.\nI think a dress principle is a good idea. The reason is simple. School is tough enough without worrying about looking cool every single day. The fact is, the less I have to decide first thing in the morning, the better. I also wouldn't mind not having to see guys wearing oversized jeans and shirts. And I certainly would welcome not seeing kids showing off designer clothes.\nAndy is surprised at my opinion. He says he can't believe that I would be willing to give up my all-American teenage birthright by dressing like -- well, like a typical teenager. Last night, he even dragged out Mom and Dad's high school photo albums. What a couple of peace-loving hippies  they were!\nThe vote for or against uniforms took place later that day. The results of the vote and the headmaster's decision will be announced next week. I wonder what it will be. I know how I voted, and I'm pretty sure I know how Andy voted.\nHow would you vote--for or against?", "id": "high4520.txt"}
