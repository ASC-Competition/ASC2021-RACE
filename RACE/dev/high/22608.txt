Although the process has been going on since you went to middle school, the biggest change is going to take place. Now, instead of taking several subjects, you have chosen one major subject because you find it interesting and worth exploring further. The choice was yours. You also have before you the goal of getting a degree. The degree, and the stages you have to pass through to achieve it, give you motivation, even though it may become weak from time to time, and not all parts of the course will be exciting; a sure way to lose interest is to do too little work. It is a law of diminishing returns---the less work you do, the less interest you will have and the more bored you will become. So regular work is needed to keep your interest as well as keep pace with new work.\n   Another change is in the relationship with those who teach you. This may well have changed during middle school and high school, but now the whole context is different. You are no longer forced to stay in school all day, and you organize your own time and place for studying. You are there to study actively rather than to be taught passively. Your teachers may or may not urge you, but they do want you to share their interest in the subject and they want you to succeed.\n   The teacher works as your coach or trainer. If you were becoming a professional tennis player or musician, you would expect your coach to look out for ways of improving your performance, and to criticize your work all the time; you would be silly to feel fed up about this---in fact you would  _ your coach if he just said everything was fine. So if you get work back with a poorer mark than you expected and with various criticisms, don't feel discouraged by this. If you don't understand what is wrong and how to improve, then ask your teacher to explain and don't be satisfied until you do understand.", "id": "high22608.txt"}
