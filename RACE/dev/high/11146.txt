A question in October from a woman wondering whether she should attend her neighbors' holiday parties broke my heart: \"I am not able to do the same in return, and I just feel like a freeloader to do so,\" she wrote. \"I'm not even in a position this year to take an appropriate thankyou gift with me.\" I told her to go, of course.\nMeanwhile, hosts worried about the costs of entertaining -- the hosts who write to me, anyway. On the other hand, the hosts that guests write to me about have taken some extreme measures to reduce the cost of their hospitality. These range from a dinner party where a relative of the host explained how expensive the steaks were and \"rather pointedly suggested\" that the letter writer \"make a financial contribution\" to the cost of dinner, to some Cape Cod homeowners who invited a couple to spend a weekend with them -- as long as they brought their own food, bottled water, and toilet paper.\nWeddings and other special events always create extra sources of stress, worsened by the fact that people rarely want to talk honestly about their money situations. One couple chose to have only a civil wedding ceremony for financial reasons and wondered how to tell people this without going into too much detail. A sixtysomething couple needed to cut back on Christmas gifts to their children but weren't sure how to tell them about it. People who had been laid off wondered how to notify friends, respond to inquiries about their job search, and compete with former colleagues for positions.\nIf you are searching for the answers to them, write to me--an advice columnist.", "id": "high11146.txt"}
