If you didn't study Latin,you couldn't be a nurse,so I enrolled. Many Latin words were familiar to me. The hard part turned out to be the usage and creating sentences with the words that seemed so easy to pronounce. Several weeks into the course my teacher came to me,saying,\"I think you should withdraw from this course. It seems to be too hard for you. \"\nThat was the day I learned I wasn't smart enough to become a nurse. With shame. I handed in my Latin textbook.\nAfter high school,the years raced by. I married and had children. Then one day my husband John came home. \"Carol. Max died this afternoon. \"I looked at my husband with disbelief.\nJohn was touched by this tragedy.

I wanted so badly to open it,but with my lack of confidence,I laid it on the kitchen counter saying,\" I'm not in the mood for a rejection letter today. \"\nFinally I forced myself to open it. \"Dear Carol,\"I read. \"We are pleased to inform you that you successfully passed the entrance exam.\"\nAn insensitive teacher once stole my dream. If you have a dream, exhaust every effort to reach it. I've worked thirty years now as a nurse and I've never been more certain that this is what I was meant to be.", "id": "high8191.txt"}
