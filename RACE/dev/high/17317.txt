Zhang never even met the people who hired him. Instead, all the necessary transactions  were done through myTino.com, a Hangzhou based online outsourcing network. Zhang has already earned enough money to pay for two semesters of university tuition. \nZhang is one of the growing number of college students tasting the fruit of globalization. They search for outsourcing projects in fields like programming, art design, translating and writing from both Western and domestic businesses. \nThis way of making money is becoming common among college students with free time, especially among those who are tech-savvy  . The payment for such work is rather high, partly because the tasks demand more skills than many other \"traditional\" part-time jobs do. For instance, creating a website for foreign companies pays $2,000 to $5,000, which is rather high. \nThe good money is just one benefit. These outsourcing jobs \"can also help us to use the knowledge we gained in university,\" said Zhang. \"Through the tasks assigned by the companies, I can easily find the key hot spots in my field, and what abilities I am lacking. By doing the tasks, I can improve my skills and gain experience.\"", "id": "high17317.txt"}
