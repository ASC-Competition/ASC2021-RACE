I never heard any noise from the children, but the parents were always _ at them.\nWe often met. I always spoke, but the only answer I ever got was a hello from a four-year-old girl. One day when I returned, they were just coming back to their apartment and the little girl was holding the door in the hall open for the others. I remained in the car doing unnecessary things. The parents were telling her to hurry. I looked up and saw the little girl was still holding the door open, waiting for me. I hurried as much as I could and thanked her. She was smiling from ear to ear.\nThat afternoon I was at the K-Mart and saw a white teddy bear. I thought of the little girl and said to myself, \"I bet she would like it.\" So I bought it for her.\nThe next day there was a knock on the door and it was the little girl and her father. She was so proud of her bear and thanked me. Then I noticed her mother and the other children were there in the hall, too.\nNow when we meet in the hall, we all speak in a friendly manner. Last night we had about four inches of snow. The temperature was below zero. When I opened the outside door, there was my car with all the snow removed. The man next door was the only person I knew in the whole building, so when I saw him the next day, I asked him if he was the nice person that removed the snow. He said NO. He wanted to, but his wife said she wanted to do it.\nIsn't it amazing that the small kind act of a four-year-old girl can change so many things for the better?", "id": "high10775.txt"}
