Who wouldn't be _ by returning to the past or seeing the future? But time travel seems to be possible only in our imagination or in science fiction  .\nScience fiction is a world where impossible things can become possible and that's why most of us like it. But science fiction is not entirely fiction since it is based on science theories  . Time travel, for instance, is a theme used by sci-fi writers. Readers may sometimes think writers have first-hand experience of it. I have collected some of the popular ways in which time travel is made possible in science fiction:\n* Through the wormhole -- A wormhole is a path between points in space-time. According to Einstein, an object can pass through a wormhole if it can travel at the speed of light. An example of a wormhole is described in Riddle of the Red Bible.\n* Through a black hole -- A black hole is a vacuum   in space where light cannot even escape or pass through. In some sci-fi movies, like Star Trek, black holes became the means to travel through time.\n* Through time machines -- In science fiction, time machines are vehicles that can travel faster than light. It can be a strange vehicle like the TARDIS in Doctor Who or a special car like the one used in Back to the Future. But these special vehicles would need a wormhole to travel to the past or the future.\n* Through parallel universe   -- Another popular way to travel through time is to be able to get into a parallel universe where one can go back to a point in time and see a different reality.\nThough we know time travel may not be possible, it is still an entertaining subject and a heated topic for most of us. And in science fiction, where reality is always in the imagination, time does not really matter.", "id": "high13220.txt"}
