E-mail is a useful tool but many feel controlled by this new tool. The average business person is getting about 80e-mails per day and many feel that about 80% of the messages in their \"Inbox\" are of little or no value. So, I have four suggestions to help you to become better at \"Erasing E-mail\".\n1.Get off the lists. The best way to deal with a problem is to never have it. If you are receiving a lot of unwanted e-mails, ask to be removed from the various lists. This would include your inclusion in unwanted lists.\n2.\"Unlisted address\". Just as you keep an \"unlisted\" telephone number that you share only with those whom you want to have direct access to, you might want to get a separate e-mail address only for the important communications you wish to receive.\n3.Check it once or twice per day. Many I speak with are becoming chained to their email server, monitoring incoming email continuously. Maybe this is because e-mail creates its own sense of urgency, but most of thecommunications are not all that urgent. I respond to them a couple of times per day.\n4.Deal with it. As you open each e-mail, do one of the following:\na. If it requires a quick response, respond to it and delete it.\nb. If it requires a response but is not the best use of your time, try to find someone else to do it.\nc. If it is going to take any serious amount of time to respond, schedule it for action in your Day Planner andthen download the message, save it, or print it out for future action.\nI personally receive about 250 e-mails per day and by practicing the suggestions above, I can handle thatvolume in about an hour, taking advantage of this fantastic tool but not being controlled by it to make sure I'mdoing more important tasks in my day.", "id": "high14781.txt"}
