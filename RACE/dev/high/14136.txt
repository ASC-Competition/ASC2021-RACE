Have you understood what you saw on the screen? Maybe everyone has their own learning style.\nGenerally speaking, we gather information with our minds and bodies in different ways, such as seeing, hearing and doing. Then our brains deals with that information, organizing it and connecting it to things we are already aware of. In other words, our brains will deal with the information in different ways. Sometimes we think in pictures or words. Sometimes we remember details or the big pictures.\nFor different people, their learning styles are different too. One person may find it hard to make out the information in written forms but easy to know it immediately in an oral description. However, another person might find difficulties with the picture but the written message.\nNow scientists say there exist seven basic learning styles.\n*Linguistic: These people learn through listening, reading, speaking and writing.\n*Logical: These people learn with formula   and principles  .\n*Visual: These people learn by seeing what they are studying.\n*Musical: These people learn well when information is presented through music.\n*Kinesthetic: These people learn from movement and physical activities.\n*Intrapersonal: These people learn best by linking new information directly with their own experiences.\n*Interpersonal: These people learn well by working with others.\nTherefore, if you know what learning style is your strength, you can balance your weakness, and get a more successful learning experience.", "id": "high14136.txt"}
