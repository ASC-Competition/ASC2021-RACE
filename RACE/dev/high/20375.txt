One of nature's great mysteries is why the zebra has stripes  . One theory is that the stripes help the zebra cool down. On hot days the black stripes get a lot hotter than the white area of the zebra and under the black stripes there are special layers of fat for protection. Hot air then rises off the black stripes, forcing colder air down around the white areas, cooling the zebra down. This, however, is just a kind of theory. The stripes can also confuse predators(,) when zebras stay with other animals in great numbers. \nZebras have excellent hearing and eyesight and can run at speeds of up to 56 kilometers per hour. They also have a powerful kick that can cause serious injury to a predator, like a lion, or an African wild dog. Usually the lead male of the herd stays at the back of the group to defend against predators if necessary, while the females and youngsters escape danger.\nZebras are herbivores that feed only on plants and live mostly by eating grasses, although they also might eat a bit on the leaves and stems  of bushes. They eat grasses for many hours each day, using their strong teeth. Spending so much time chewing wears the zebras' teeth down, so their teeth keep growing all their lives. As the dry season arrives and the grasses die back, zebra herds travel to find more food and water holes for drinking. Most zebras have no specific territories. They travel from place to place, never staying in one area very long.", "id": "high20375.txt"}
