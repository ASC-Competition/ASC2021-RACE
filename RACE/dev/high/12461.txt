I have snakes for daughters, and my wife, believe it or not, is a dragon! Do I live in a zoo? No, of course not! I am talking about Chinese zodiac signs . Depending on the year of your birth, each person has an animal for a sign. That's why I am a pig and my wife is a dragon. If you, like me, were born in the year of the pig, then you are brave, thoughtful and loyal. The year of the pig is filled with good fortune.\nNow let's take a closer look at this interesting animal.\nPigs were first raised by man about 9,000 years ago, and are still a very common farm animal in many parts of the world. We don't just use pigs for their meat -- almost every part of the animal is used. The hair is used for artists' brushes. The fat is used to make floor wax, rubber and plastics.\nPigs have also been important in the world of entertainment. In 1995 the film 'Babe' starred a loveable talking pig as its main character. The film won an Oscar and was nominated  for 6 more. In England you can even go to watch pig racing. A farmer, Rob Shepherd, has been raising money for charity by holding pig races on his farm. The events have been very successful. People don't just want to eat pigs, it seems!\nPigs also play an important role in the English language.

Well, you can say that they \"saved your bacon\".", "id": "high12461.txt"}
