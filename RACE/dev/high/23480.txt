The answer is that both inspired major changes in their societies by writing an essay. In October,a student at west Milford high school in New Jersey read an article in her local newspaper that disturbed her. The article reported that the board of education had decided to use  _ tray in the lunchroom because they were less expensive than paper one's.\n    Vogt knew from her science class that polystyrene can have harmful effects on the environment in the first place. It is not biodegradable,meaning that it can't be broken down by natural biological processes. in addition,some polystyrene products give off gases called chloroflulrocarbons(CFCs)into the air. Scientific evidence indicates that these CFCs break down the protective ozone layer of the atmosphere. \n    Vogt decided to write a paper for her social studies class on the issue of polystyrene. Her teacher, Carl Stehle,read her paper to the class. After reminding students that Thomas Paine had had to persuade many hesitant colonists  to support the American Revolution,Stehle challenged his class to do something about the polystyrene problem. \n    Vogt and her classmates immediately conducted a survey in the high school and middle school . They discovered that a large majority of students said they wanted to switch back to paper goods in the cafeteria. When they presented their findings to the board of education,the boards business administrator did a survey of his own. He found that roughly 80 percent of the students in the two schools would be willing to pay extra 5 cents to eat their lunch from paper trays. As a result,the board voted in December to change to paper trays in all the townships schools.", "id": "high23480.txt"}
