Then university life came!\nI thought that I must have some learning disorder, as it seemed that everyone else was absorbing the material and making progress while to me it was an insurmountable  struggle. There were never enough hours in the day and weekend to attend the lectures, study the lessons and then do the assignment.\nDuring my darkest hour I called home to speak to my father: \"Dad, I don't think I can handle this.\" My father then said something, which cut through me like a knife: \"There is no returning home. If you quit, then you are on your own.\"\nI hung up thinking what a terrible heartless thing to say. Then, I determined to somehow gut it out . There seemed to be no other choices available! Soon afterwards, I noticed a sigh posted in a campus common area stating: \"Studying Skills\" with a place & time to meet. It said that \"there is help available\". I attended that meeting! I soon discovered there were several others in a similar situation and that everyone wanted to help each other get through this challenging first term. I soon found a study partner, who helped me a lot, and I was grateful to him for his kind help.\nYes, it was still a very challenging first year, but I found the needed strength and support to get through it. In fact my father has been helping me since then, but he has done it in another way. I know now in my heart that he did the very best help he could to help me fly. Thanks Dad for the push!", "id": "high3575.txt"}
