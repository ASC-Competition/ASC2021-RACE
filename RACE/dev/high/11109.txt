One of the pots had a crack  in it, and while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the master's house, the cracked pot arrived only half full.\nThis went on daily. The perfect pot was proud of its accomplishment. Of course, the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection. After two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure, it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream.\n\"I am ashamed of myself, and I want to apologise to you.\"\n\"Why?\" asked the bearer. \"What are you ashamed of?\"\n\"I have been able, for these past two years, to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back. And you do no get full value for your efforts\" the pot explained.\nThe water bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot, and in his compassion he said, \"As we return to the master's house, I want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path.\"\nAs they went up the hill, the cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path, and this cheered it a little.\nThe bearer said, \"Did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path, but not on the other pot's side?\" That is because I have known about you, and I took advantage of it. I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walked back from the stream, you have watered them. For two years, I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my master's table. Without you being just the way you are, he would not have this beauty to grace his house.\"", "id": "high11109.txt"}
