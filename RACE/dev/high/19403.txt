Visits to the White House are in high demand, and you must make your request through your member of Congress  up to six months, and no fewer than 21 days, before your visit. Be sure to check the White House tour-info Web site to make sure about the personal identification you'll need. And before the day of your visit, call 202-456-7041 to confirm the tour schedule.\nLincoln's Cottage - Lincoln's Cottage, the hilltop home where President Lincoln lived during part of the Civil War, is simply furnished but features lighting effects and actors' recordings that reveal Lincoln's thoughts on slavery and the war. \"In the library you can actually see the ghost lines of where the library shelves would have been,\" says cottage director Erin Carlson Mast. \"We haven't re-created the bookshelves because that was such an amazing moment of discovery for us that we wanted to preserve that so people can have that moment of discovery themselves.\" \nLibrary of Congress - The Library of Congress is housed in three buildings: the Thomas Jefferson Building, James Madison Memorial Building and the John Adams Building. Although trying to see all of it in one day is possible, it's probably best to do a little thinking ahead and figure out which areas you'd really like to explore (i.e. when your feet start to hurt, you won't feel so bad about not catching everything). The most popular visitor destination is the Thomas Jefferson Building, but there are things worth seeing - murals , sculptures, performances - elsewhere in the complex.", "id": "high19403.txt"}
