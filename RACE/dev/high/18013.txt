A woman with a baby in her arms is trying to open the door, but fails. Finding no way, she rushes into her bedroom and there they survive the earthquake.\n       In a factory building, as the workshop floor swings under the terrible shaking, workers run for safety. Some hide under the machines and survive, but others who try to run outside are killed by the falling ceilings.\n       These scenes, played by actors and actresses, are from a film of science education Making a Split Second Decision shown in 1998 on China Central TV in memory of Tangshan Earthquake. \n        By studying actual cases in the earthquake areas and scientific experiments, experts find that buildings remain untouched for the first 12 seconds of an earthquake.\n        In this short time, one has the best chance of surviving an earthquake by staying near the inside walls, in bedrooms and under beds, experts concluded in the film. \"Earthquakes seem to catch the lives of those who run,\" said many survivors in the earthquake areas, describing how their friends were killed on the doorways or along the stair steps as they tried to get out of the building.\n        Their advice was proved in the film, \"Take a hiding-place where you are rather than run, unless you are sure you can reach a safe open place in ten seconds.\"\n \n.
