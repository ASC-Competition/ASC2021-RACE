Walking through a parking lot in a university in Miami, I noticed a bumper sticker   that said, \"Ruin a Liberal's   Day--Recite Historical Fact!\" But Marwick thinks this sort of opinion is just fine; it is unavoidable that we all feel a sense of ownership of history.\nHistory never stands still, as Marwick says at the beginning of The Nature of History, \"The shape and content of history, too, vary according to the methods and materials available to different generations.\" Marwick's goal is to explain, in plain language, the changes in the way history is done up to the present; one method is to connect history with advances in the physical sciences. Marwick examines a number of case studies toward the end of the book. He ends the book with a refreshing collection of aphorisms   about history. History truly belongs to each and every man and we all belong to history; with the proper education, history can be made more accessible to everyone.\nMarwick relates how inventions and the physical sciences have driven historical changes. Dropping a ball in a vacuum will reveal the same properties   each time the experiment is conducted, providing the conditions are the same. But historians obviously do not have the luxury of reproducing such conditions; historians view the past through the present which depends on invention and science.\nBy looking at the changing nature of history, Marwick feels the study progressing. Although Marwick suspects some people would accuse a historian of creating job security with the endless views of the past, he insists it is imperative based on the philosophy, science, and new materials of the age. History, according to Marwick, must be for everyone and not remain locked behind the walls of academia.", "id": "high8046.txt"}
