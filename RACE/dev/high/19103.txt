We skim over articles, e-mails to try to grasp key words and the essential meaning of a certain text. Continuous information from our electronic devices, it would be impossible to cope if we read word by word, line by line. But a new trend calls on people to unplug and enjoy reading slowly, listing benefits beyond intellectual development.\nA recent story from The Wall Street Journal reported on a book club in Wellington, New Zealand, where members meet in a cafe and turn off their smart phones. They sink into cozy chairs and read in silence for an hour.\nSome of these benefits have been backed up by science. For example, a study of 300 elderly people published by the journal Neurology last year showed that regular engagement in intellectual activities like slow-reading slowed the rate of memory loss later in life.\nYet technology has made us less attentive readers. Screens have changed our reading patterns from the linear, left-to-right sequence to a wild skimming and skipping pattern as we hunt for important words and information. The Internet may have made us stupider, says Patrick Kingsley from The Guardian.  \nSlow reading means a return to an uninterrupted, linear pattern, in a quiet environment free of distractions. Aim for 30 minutes a day, advises Kelly from The Atlantic. \"You can spend half an hour pretty easily if only during your free moments -- whenever you find yourself automatically firing up your laptop to check your favorite site, or scanning Twitter for something to pass the time-you pick up a meaningful work of literature.\"", "id": "high19103.txt"}
