But some young people in China have another solution:  turn off your personal computer for the weekend and get away from the Internet.\nThe suggestion comes from a group of websites in China behind what they call \"NC63 \". The name is short for \"No Computer 63 Hours\", which means that people should shut down their personal computers (PCs) at 6 p. m. on Friday and not start them up again until 9 a. m. on Monday. You can read about the movement on their website (http:// www. nc63. org/) in Chinese -- but only on weekdays .\nThe NC63 hopes to call everyone to take real action to support a low-carbon, green life, to support environmental protection, and to choose and support the earth, by turning off the computer for the weekend.  White-collar workers are advised not to use the computer too much. The organizers hope they can get websites and PC makers to carry warning labels  , like cigarettes, saying something like \"Too much internet surfing is harmful to health.\"\\\nShutdown Day is once a year, though.  NC63 is every weekend.\nThe group' s first official event, took place on Nov. 29,ahead of the Copenhagen talks. About 100 volunteers gathered at Sanlitun Village, an shopping area in Beijing. They came to Starbucks and other cafes and restaurants to find those using laptops to surf the Internet. People caught using laptops were handed \"tickets\" ( actually small leaflets (  ) explaining NC63' s philosophy ).\nNC63 has a point about PC use. While PC use isn' t generally regarded as a primary contributor ( ) to China' s carbon emissions -- the biggest in the world, some global warming activists argue that it makes a big difference. One U. S. group estimates that a typical desktop PC with a 17-inch monitor could, if left on all day ever)' day for a year, give off over 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.", "id": "high21029.txt"}
