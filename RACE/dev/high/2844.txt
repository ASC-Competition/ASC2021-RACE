Through an international campaign by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) on the request of Egypt and Sudan, resources were found to move the temples to a new site. In 1965,a conference at the White House in Washington DC, USA called for a \"World Heritage Trust\" and international cooperation to protect \"the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future\". In 1969, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) developed similar proposals for its members .Therefore, the Convention was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1972. By regarding heritage as both cultural and natural, the Convention reminds us of the ways in which people interact with nature , and of the basic need to keep the balance between the two.\nThe Convention identifies the natural or cultural sites on the World Heritage List, and sets out their role in protecting them .Although the emphasis has been on sites and natural features of \"outstanding universal value\", each country promises not only to _ the World Heritage sites situated in its country, but also to protect and conserve its cultural and natural heritage.\nThere is also a \"List of World Heritage in Danger\" which are sites threatened by serious and specific dangers caused by changes in the use or ownership of the land , wars or natural disasters.", "id": "high2844.txt"}
