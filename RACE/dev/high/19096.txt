Sorry if your answer is \"no\", because it will be common in the near future, according to the researchers from the Oxford.\nA third of British jobs are at \"high risk\" of being replaced by robots in the next 20 years, the research by Deloitte, the Oxford Martin School and the University of Oxford found.\nWired magazine went further. \"It may be hard to believe, but before the end of this century, 70 percent of today's jobs will be replaced by automation ,\" said the magazine in 2012.\nOf course, people being replaced by robots is not recent news. Robots have been taking over labor work in factories and on farms for some time, lifting heavy boxes and picking fruit and vegetables. Next, cleaning jobs in offices and schools will be taken over by late-night robots, starting with easy-to-do floors and windows and eventually moving to toilets, Wired predicted.\nBut that's just the beginning. Even white-collar jobs are not safe. Any jobs dealing with sales and services or lots of paperwork could be taken over by robots in the future. For example, in the UK, library assistants have decreased by 48 percent since 2001, sales-related jobs have fallen by 40 percent, and travel agents by 44 percent, the Daily Mail reported.\nBut that doesn't mean that human beings will have nothing to do in the future. Instead, we need to update our skills. Digital know-how, management and creativity will be in greater need in the future, said British Consulting Company Deloitte.", "id": "high19096.txt"}
