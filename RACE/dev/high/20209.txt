But modern advertising does more than gives news about products and services . Today's advertisements , or ads , try to get consumers to buy certain brands . Writers of advertising are so skillful that they can sometimes persuade a consumer to wear a certain kind of clothing , eat a special kind of cereal , or see a movie . Consumers might never even want a product if they did not see or hear advertisement for it . For example , you probably do not need the newest cereal in the supermarket . There are probably many cereal brands on your kitchen shelves . You may not have space on your shelf for another . But if you see ads about a new cereal that is your extratasty and has a free prize in the box , you may want it . Advertising must get attention . To be effective , it must be exciting , entertaining , or provide pleasure . The secret of writing good advertising copy is to offer a good idea as well as a product . The idea is what the ad is really selling . One example is an ad that says eating a certain cereal will make a person do well in sports . That cereal brand may sell better if consumers think it offers strength and energy .", "id": "high20209.txt"}
