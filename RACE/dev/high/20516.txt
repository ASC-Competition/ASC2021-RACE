It is celebrated in the state of Punjab on the 13th of January, which falls one day before Makar Sankranti. While Lohri is essentially a Punjabi festival, it is celebrated in some other states of North India as well. In cities like Delhi, which has a large population, Lohri is celebrated to show the end of the coldest days of winter. The last week of December and the first two weeks of January are usually the coldest period in Punjab and other areas of North India. However, after Lohri, the temperature starts to rise. \nDuring the day, children go from door to door singing songs in praise of   Dulha Bhatti, the Punjabi translation of Robin Hood, a thief who helped the poor and fought for their rights. These children are given sweets and food, and sometimes they are also given money. These munchies  that the children collect are known as Lohri, and they are distributed at night during the festival. \nThe festival of Lohri is celebrated outdoors. As it is usually very cold on the 13th of January, a bonfire   is lit, and friends and  s gather around. If there has been a happy occasion in the family, like the birth of a child or a marriage, Lohri is celebrated with much greater happiness. The happy family usually hosts a party to celebrate the first Lohri of the new child or couple. \nSinging and dancing form an important part of the celebrations. People wear their brightest clothes and come to dance the bhangra and gidda to the best of the dhol . Punjabi songs are sung, and everybody is happy.", "id": "high20516.txt"}
