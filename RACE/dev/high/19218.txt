During my youth he never missed a school play or softball game. In fact, he wasso supportive that I sometimes longed for one of those dads who dressed better and cared less. But my dad would forever be the guy wearing shorts with dress shoes and black socks, cheering me on, expecting greatness. \nHis other standard question - How's the car? - used to strike me as a waste of long-distance dollars from a man who once suggested making a list of what you want to talk about before calling someone out of state. What I now realize is that \"How's the car?\" is not about the car. It's a father's way of asking his adult daughter how she is doing. The advantage is that if there's something wrong with the car, he knows what to do about it and how much it will cost, whereas if you're having problems about marriage or doubting a career choice, he might have to act Mom on the line. \nAt age thirty I finally took the plunge   into adulthood by renting a car without my dad's help or advice. I'm sure my dad was hurt rather than proud. Though a daughter's independence is evidence of a job well done, it still implies the job's done, and many fathers are unwilling to retire. Even when my dad was overworked, he'd happily jump on a plane if I said I needed help. His frequent question \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" underlines the fact that he wishes there was still something he could provide. It's interesting: even though we're tied by blood and I love him no matter what, he still seems to need a concrete function - suggesting stocks, finding the cheapest plane fare - to feel he has a role in my life.", "id": "high19218.txt"}
