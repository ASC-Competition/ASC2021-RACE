The U.S. had a very resource rich environment, with  _ , fish and wildlife. In fact we have data on disadvantaged people in America, such as slaves. They were obviously among the most mistreated populations in the world, but given the resource abundance,and given the fact that the slave owners needed their work, they had to be fed  ly fairly well. So the slaves were taller than European peasants. It's no wonder that Europeans were just flooding to America.\nAmericans today are no longer the tallest people in the world. After World WarII,many Western and Northern European countries began to adopt favorable social policies. There is universal health insurance in most of these societies -- that, of course, makes a difference in health care. You can also consider income inequality in the U.S., since people who are at the low end of the totem pole   have considerable adversity making ends meet. I suspect the difference in height between Americans and Europeans is due to both diet and health care.\nAmericans today suffer from an additional problem: obesity  . If children are too well nourished, then they're not able to grow best. There are certain hormones   that control the start of the adolescent   growth and the start of adolescence. Nutrition is one of the factors, along with genetic and hormonal ones which are associated with the start of puberty  . And if puberty comes too early, then the youth will peak out sooner, and will not become as tall in adulthood as someone who had better nutrition.Also, the overload of carbohydrates and fats in a fastfood diet may hinder   the consumption of micronutrients necessary to growth.", "id": "high23166.txt"}
