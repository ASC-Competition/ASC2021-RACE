She attended Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in South Hadley, but only for one year. Throughout her life, she seldom left her home and visitors were few. The people with whom she did come in contact, however, had an enormous impact on her poetry. She was particularly stirred by the Reverend Charles Wadsworth, whom she first met on a trip to Philadelphia. While it is certain that he was an important figure in her life, it is not clear that their relationship was romantic--she called him \"my closest earthly friend.\" \nBy the 1860s, Dickinson lived in almost complete isolation from the outside world, but actively maintained many correspondences   and read widely. She spent a great deal of this time with her family. Her father, Edward Dickinson, was actively involved in state and national politics, serving in Congress for one term. Her brother, Austin, who attended law school and became an attorney  , lived next door with his wife, Susan Gilbert. Dickinson's younger sister, Lavinia, also lived at home for her entire life in similar isolation. Lavinia and Austin were not only family, but intellectual companions for Dickinson during her lifetime. \nWhile Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly eighteen hundred poems were published during her lifetime. Dickinson's poems are unique for the era in which she wrote; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends.\nHer first collection of poetry was published in 1890. A complete and mostly unaltered collection of her poetry became available for the first time in 1955. Despite some unfavorable reviews and some skepticism during the late 19th and early 20th century as to Dickinson's literary techniques, she is now almost universally considered to be one of the most important American poets.", "id": "high18046.txt"}
