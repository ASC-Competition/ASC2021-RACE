The few people who knew how to write were trained in schools set up by the church. Those who made a living by writing for other people were called scribes . \nThe work of scribes was not easy. Much of it had to be done fast in order to meet the needs of the King. the church and traders. Most of the writing was in Latin  ,but some of it was in the English of the day. And no one was quite sure how some English words should be spelled.\nOne problem was that several letters were written with short vertical strok that all looked like each other. Among them were the letters , i, u, v, m and n, Thus .five straight lines in a row might stand for uni nui uvi or mii.\nAs a result .reading was sometimes difficult, especially when the writing was done in a hurry.\nThe scribes solved the problem in part, by changing the letter u to o when it came before m. n or v. This is how sum and cum came to be written as some and come.\nAt some point, too, the scribes seemed to have decided that no English word should be ended by u or v. Thus, in time an e was added to such words as live, have, due and true. It was added, but not pronounced.", "id": "high10504.txt"}
