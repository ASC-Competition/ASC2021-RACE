What she saw there made her stop dead in her tracks.\nBeing a busy college student just one year removed from her teenage years, she wasn't exactly obsessive-compulsive  about the neatness of her clothes. But her boss at the restaurant where she works saw things a little differently. He had recently lectured the entire staff on the importance of appearance, and had specifically mentioned the need for servers to wear clean, unwrinkled blouses. As an assistant manager, Janelle felt it was important to set an example for the other employees. But if she stopped to iron the blouse normally, she would be late --and work without delay was an area of even greater concern to her boss.\nSo she grabbed her iron and plugged it in and set it for low heat. Carefully holding her blouse away from her body, she continued to iron it while she was wearing it. It seemed like a logical answer to an urgent problem.\nAnd it seemed to be working until Janelle tried to iron the collar and accidentally ironed her neck by mistake. Then it suddenly seemed like a really stupid idea and a really painful one as well. It took more time to treat her burn than it would have taken to iron her shirt properly. And she spent a miserable shift dealing with the pain of the burn.\nWe've all been there, haven't we? For me it was cutting my own hair. For a former roommate it was trying to pull his own wisdom teeth. For another college acquaintance, it was trying to change the oil in his car while the motor was still running.\n\"There's a right way and a wrong way of doing things,\" Dad used to tell me whenever I'd spoil the look of our yard by trying out a faster, easier and more creative way of pulling weeds or edging the lawn. \"If a thing is worth doing,\" he said, \"it's worth doing it right.\" There's a reason why certain things are done in certain ways. Those old, boring, predictable ways work.", "id": "high6429.txt"}
