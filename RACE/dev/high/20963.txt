Richard Branson's space tourism venture said it hoped to launch the service in two years, but even that date wasn't fixed. The firm's commercial director, Stephen Attenborough, told the BBC that its customers?safety was vital. Test flights are currently under way, with rocket-powered tests scheduled to start next year.\nAlmost 500 people have bought tickets. Richard had originally hoped the first commercial spacecraft, Spaceship Two, would take off as early as 2007. However, Mr. Attenborough stressed there never was an official date set for the first launch.\nStephen Attenborough criticized some press reports, particularly an article in the Wall Street Journal, which described the 2013 goal as ''yet another delay\".\n\"This is a programme that can?t have a hard-end date as safety is number one priority ,\"Mr. Attenborough said, \"Our foot is flat on the gas. We have proven technology, we have a spaceport that opened last week, and the test flight programme is well advanced -----I don't think you can ask for a lot more from a programme like this. A delay is a strange word, and there is no delay. \"\nKeith Colmer, a former Air Force test pilot, was chosen from more than 500 applicants ,among them a handful of astronauts. The BBC,s Richard Scott was the first journalist to be allowed inside the Virgin Galactic spaceship.\nRichard has held an official ceremony for the launch pad for the space tourism venture in the New Mexico desert on 18,October. He plans to take the first flight, accompanied by his children.\nMr. Attenborough said that although all of the future tourists were eager to take off to space, none were pushing for an early flight. \"They are willing to put a large a- mount of money up front because they trust us, because they know we will only take them to space if it's safe to do so,\" he said.\nThe 2. 5-hour flights will offer five minutes of weightlessness. Tickets cost $ 200,000.", "id": "high20963.txt"}
