The study itself does not show whether high-protein diets really raise the risk of any colon diseases, but the findings raise that possibility.\n       Diets  ly high in protein and lower in carbs have been shown to help heavy people lose weight. \"People should not be discouraged from losing weight,\" Dr Flint said. However, he added, they should make sure that any weight loss plan includes adequate amounts of fiber and a high protein intake over months to years might have ill effects on the colon.\n       The findings are based on 17 overweight men who followed three short-term diets: a one-week menu plan to keep their weight; a four-week high-protein diet with reasonable amounts of carbohydrates; and a four-week high-protein diet low in carbs.\n       On average, the study found when the men were on the high-protein diets, they had higher levels of substances known as N-nitroso compounds  and other metabolites  that have been linked to cancer. And when they were on the high-protein, low-carb diet, they had lowered amounts of fiber-originated compounds thought to be protective against cancer.\n       Exactly what those changes might mean for a person's health is not clear, but Flint said that the findings suggest that people should be cautious about consuming too much protein and too little fiber over a long period. In general, experts recommend that adults get about 28 grams of fiber per day--though it's not known whether that's enough for someone on a high-protein weight-loss diet.", "id": "high20288.txt"}
