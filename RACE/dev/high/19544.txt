With just his bare hands he could defeat a bull in a matter of seconds . To make sure people knew just who he was , his helmet and cloak were decorated with his victory souvenirs . On his helmet were over a hundred horns , and on his cloak were a thousand precious stones ; one stone for each enemy he had defeated .\nIn his city everyone would make way for him as he went by , but one day a young man who was absent-mindedly reading as he walked , bumped into Olav . Olav was furious . He scolded the young man and challenged him to a fight to the death . The skinny young man had no choice ; all he could do was accept on one condition :\n\" I can't see very well , and i don't know you , so I'll need you keep your helmet and cloak on during the fight so i can make you out . \"\nOlav laughed a hearty laugh and accepted the young man's stupid condition , before launching himself at the youth . The boy was swift , and he only just managed to slip through Olav's hands . The same happened each time Olav attacked , and as the fight went on it became easier for the young man to evade the attacks . Although no one could believe how the boy did it , they all expected him to fall down dead as soon as Olav landed the first blow .\nBut that blow never came . Olav had been attacking for more than five minutes , and after ten minutes he fell to the ground , as if dead .\nMany onlookers thought the young man must be some kind of wizard , but the boy , who was a medical student by the name of Virtensen , had demonstrated to everyone how Olav's pride had been enough to make him fall under the weight of his helmet and cloak . When Olav came to , like a good warrior he accepted his defeat . From that day he got rid of the useless souvenirs on his helmet and cloak , and returned to simple clothing . Now wherever he walked he was just like anyone else . Everywhere , that is , except for when he walked on the battlefield , where he came to be recognized not for his many horns or his bejeweled cloak , but for his unparalleled force .", "id": "high19544.txt"}
