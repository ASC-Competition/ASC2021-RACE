Many winners experience the so-called curse of the lottery, with some squandering their fortunes and others meeting tragic ends.\n\"So many of them wind up unhappy or wind up broke. People have had terrible things happen,\" said Don McNay, 56, a financial consultant to lottery winners and the author of Life Lessons from the Lottery. \"People commit suicide. People run through their money. Easy comes, easy goes. They go through divorce or people die.\"\n\"It's just a great change that they're not ready for,\" McNay told Time on Tuesday. \"It's the curse of the lottery because it made their lives worse instead of improving them.\"\nAbout 70 percent of people who suddenly receive a windfall of cash will lose it within a few years, according to the National Endowment for Financial Education.

Dorris \"Dee Dee\" Moore, who authorities say befriended him after his lottery win, was found guilty of first degree murder in 2012.

He said that to me all the time,\" Brown said.", "id": "high19763.txt"}
