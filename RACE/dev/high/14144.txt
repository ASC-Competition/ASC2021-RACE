From a distance, each horse looks like any other horses. But if you get a more careful look, you will notice something quite amazing.\nOne of the horses is blind. His owner has chosen not to kill it, but has made him a safe and comfortable barn to live in. This alone is very amazing. But if you stand nearby and listen, you will hear the sound of a bell. It is coming from a smaller horse with a small, gold-colored bell. It lets the blind friend know where the other horse is, so he can follow. As you stand and watch these two friends, you'll see that the horse with the bell is always checking on the blind horse and makes sure that the blind horse can hear the bell, slowly walk to where he is, and won't get lost.\nWhen the horse with the bell returns to the barn each evening, he will sometimes stop to look back, making sure that the blind friend isn't too far behind to hear the bell.\nLike the owners of these two horses, God does not throw us away just because we are not perfect, or because we have problems or challenges. He watches over us and even brings others into our lives to help us when we are in trouble. Sometimes we are the blind horse which is being guided by the little ringing bells. And at other times we are the guide horse, helping others to find their way.", "id": "high14144.txt"}
