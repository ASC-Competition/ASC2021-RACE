They might play games, tell stories or watch football on television together.\nAngelo Rosa has more Thanksgiving memories than most people. From Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, the 100-year-old man lives in the same house where he celebrated a great number of Thanksgiving.\nBut he says it was different when he was a child. Mr. Rosa was just three when his family came to America. \"When we were small children, Thanksgiving was never a very big holiday because at the time we actually didn't pay too much attention to it.\" But, also, he says, his parents faced a language difficulty. \"They were from Italy and spoke very broken English, because they were the first generation that came over here.\"\nAnd the family had little money. There were six children. Mr. Rosa's father was a coal miner in Pennsylvania. The family was not able to have big, costly dinners, especially during the hard time of the 1930's. But Mr. Rosa says Thanksgiving dinners became a tradition in his own family after he married and had children.\nThis Thanksgiving, Angelo Rosa will go to the home of his daughter about twenty minutes away. He will celebrate the day with loved ones, including his great-grandchildren.\nOn the other side of the country, Cathie Dahlstrom is preparing dishes for a group of 35 to 40 people in Concord, California. We asked Ms Dahlstrom what she is thankful for this year; her first answer is \"The election.\" She said she is also deeply grateful for her very large family. Ms Dahlstrom has one daughter. She has five younger brothers and sisters. She also has eight stepbrothers and stepsisters. Many of them and their families will be at the Thanksgiving dinner.", "id": "high6973.txt"}
