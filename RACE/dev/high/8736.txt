We have to do it in a group. It has to be finished this Friday, but Gary, the boy in our group, has done nothing helpful. He just keeps _ .\nEvery time we talk about the work with him, he always says, \"Don't worry. I'll do it later.\" But he seldom does his job. And when he does, he does it the wrong way. Someone has to do it for him again. What's worse is when Ms. Lin asks about our group, Gary always tells her that we others don't work hard enough. I'm really mad at Gary about this. We're in the same group. Shouldn't we help each other to do a better job?\nKate\nDear Kate,\nIt is important for students to learn how to work together in a group. Maybe you should talk to Gary about the problem and tell him you all need his help. If he still doesn't change, go talk to your teacher. I believe she can make Gary do his job.\nAunt Tara", "id": "high8736.txt"}
