It promotes home cooking, and the use of fresh, unprocessed produce. It was founded as reaction to the popularity of unhealthy fast food. It also encourages people to buy food from local businesses, rather than large supermarkets.\nThe movement began in 1986. at that time, McDonald's wanted to open a restaurant in the centre of Rome (Italy). Food writer Carlo Perini, along with others, was against this. So, the Slow Food Organization was born. Today, it has overt 100,00 members in 132 countries. And its symbol is one of the world's slowest moving creatures, the snail. The organization's website explains, \"The snail was chosen because it moves slowly, and calmly eats its way through life.\"\nBut Slow Food isn't just about the food we eat. It's also about how we eat it. Slow foodies say that in our fast - food world with very little time, we've forgotten that eating should be a social activity. They believe families should eat together and talk, rather than watch TV with their dinner while sitting in front of it. In fact, research has shown that if children grow up in a family that eats together at the table, they are more likely to do well in school, and less likely to have behavioral problems or devel op eating disorders.\nAnd there's more! Slow Food has sparked an entire Slow Food Movement. This encourages people to slow down the pace of their busy lives. And now, within the movement, there's Slow Money, Slow Travel, Slow Parenting, Slow Art and Slow Media, among many others. In 1999 The World Institute of Slowness was formed. One of the Institute's slogans is a quotation by the famous American actress Mae West. She said, \"Everything worth doing in life, is worth doing slowly.\" Do you agree? No need to answer straight away. Have a long hard think about it. Take your time. And get back to us when you can.", "id": "high22067.txt"}
