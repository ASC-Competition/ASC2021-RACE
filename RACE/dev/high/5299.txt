But it doesn't have to be that way. Doing something enjoyable with your kids just might make you look at each other in a whole new way, especially if you do it through a class or an event. When parent and child become students together, it puts them on the same level, at least for a while.\n\"I really like parents to come to class with their kids--they start sharing things and talking about what they're doing and what they like,\" said art teacher Pyper Dixon.\nHowever, finding something new in common is a big choice for them, especially when kids get involved in sports and other after-school activities. But it's possible to learn a new skill or hobby together.\nThat's certainly true of Lauren, 11, of Silver Spring, who is in Dixon's class with her father, Dennis. \"I was just going to drop her off,\" Dennis said, \"but Dixon persuaded me to stay.\"\nNow Lauren gets to _ her father about doing his art homework. \"He always leaves it to the last minute,\" she said. \"But then he'll turn around to do amazing drawings,\" she added, \"We have different styles of drawing, so it's interesting to talk it over with him.\"\nWithout the Saturday morning art class, Dennis said, he would be reading the paper, and Lauren would be on her own in her room or on the computer. But they talk more now. \"I can't think of an experience where you communicate with your kid so closely,\" he said.", "id": "high5299.txt"}
