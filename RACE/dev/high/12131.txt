The effect of their grandparents' involvement was stronger compared to children from two biological parent families.\"\nThe study did not look at children who lived solely with their grandparents, though.\nThe findings have great implications for people in the United States, the authors said, because American grandparents are increasingly sharing living space with their grandchildren. A 2004 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more than 5 million households include a grandparent and a grandchild under 18, up 30 percent since 1990, according to background information in the news release.", "id": "high12131.txt"}
