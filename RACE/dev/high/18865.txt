A team at the Institute of Cancer Research in London found women had larger waistlines if their bedroom was \"light enough to see across\" at night. However, they caution there is not enough evidence to advise people to buy thicker curtains or turn off lights.\nThe women were asked to rate the amount of light in their bedrooms at night as: Light enough to read. Light enough to see across the room, but not read. Light enough to see your hand in front of you, but not across the room. Too dark to see your hand or you wear a mask.\nProf Anthony Swerdlow told the BBC: \"In this very large group of people there is an association between reported light exposure at night and overweight and obesity. But there is not sufficient evidence to know if making your room darker would make any difference to your weight. There might be other explanations for the association, but the findings are encouraging enough to guarantee further scientific investigation.\"\nThe light is disrupting the body clock, which stems from our evolutionary past when we were active when it was light in the day and resting when it was dark at night. Light changes mood, physical strength and even the way we process food in a 24-hour cycle. Artificial light is known to disrupt the body clock by delaying the production of the sleep hormone melatonin.\nProf Derk-Jan Dijk said there would be no harm in trying to make bedrooms darker. He told the BBC: \"People in general are not aware of the light present in their bedroom. I think people should assess their bedroom and see how easy it would be to make it darker.\" Street lights, some alarm clocks and standby lights on electrical equipment such as televisions could light a room, he said. \"Overall this study points to the importance of darkness,\" he concluded.", "id": "high18865.txt"}
