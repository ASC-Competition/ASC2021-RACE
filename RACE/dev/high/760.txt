As a result, facial expressions that had been considered universally recognizable cannot be used to reliably convey emotion in cross-cultural situations.\nThe researchers studied cultural differences in the recognition of facial expressions by recording the eye movements of 13 Western Whites and 13 East Asian people while they observed pictures of expressive faces and put them into categories: happy, sad, surprised, fearful, disgusted, angry, or neutral. They compared how accurately participants read those facial expressions using their particular eye movement strategies.\nIt turned out that Easterners focused much greater attention on the eyes and made significantly more errors than Westerners did. \"The cultural difference in eye movements that _ show is probably a reflection of cultural difference in facial expressions,\" Jack said. \"Our data suggest that whereas Westerners use the whole face to convey emotion, Easterners use the eyes more and mouth less.\"\nIn short, the data show that facial expressions are not universal signals of human emotion. From here on, examining how cultural factors have diversified these basic social skills will help our understanding of human emotion. Otherwise, when it comes to communicating emotions across cultures, Easterners and Westerners will find themselves lost in translation.", "id": "high760.txt"}
