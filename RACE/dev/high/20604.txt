Are computers affecting our health? Many people think high--tech products have affected us because we spend more time playing on computers, watching TV and using our mobile phones to talk, text and play games.\nOur bodies: Levels of obesity are rising, especially young children. But this isn't just a problem about what we eat. Many people, especially teenagers, like sitting in front of TV sets or computers for hours, just watching or playing games. As a result, they do less exercise.\nOur brains: Research into the effects on the human brain while playing computer games is ongoing. Recent studies have looked at the impact on beta brainwave activity, which is important for emotional development, planning and self-control. Though we haven't evidence to show how it affects us, researchers think that tiredness may affect the levels of beta brainwave activity, and sitting in front of a TV set or computer for a long time easily causes one to feel tired. So parents who don't want to spoil their children's fun should control the time they spend on the computer.\nCommunication: As leading computer game consumers, are we spending too much time in front of computers? Does it mean that we spend less time communicating with other people? What effect does this have on our lives?\nIt certainly seems that children today are spending more time indoors than their parents did when they were young. Children used to play in the streets or in parks regularly. Today, empty parks clearly show how \"play time\" has changed because of advances in affordable technology like home computers.", "id": "high20604.txt"}
