I prefer students to begin at an earlier age. Robby said that it had always been his mother's dream to hear him play the piano, so I took him on as a student.\nRobby tried and tried while I listened and encouraged him and gave him more instructions. But he just did not have any inborn ability.\nI only saw his mother from a distance. She always waved and smiled but never came in.  Then one day Robby stopped coming to our lessons. I thought about calling him but I guessed he had decided to try something else.\nI was also glad that he stopped coming for the sake of my career. However, several weeks before the recital   of my students, Robby came,telling me that he never stopped practicing and begged me to allow him to take part in it. I agreed, but I made him perform last in the program, so I could save his poor performance through my \"curtain closer\".\nI was surprised when he announced that he had chosen one piece of Mozart's. However, never had I heard a piece of Mozart's played so well by someone at his age. \nI ran up and put my arms around Robby in joy. \"I've never heard you play like that, Robby! How could you do it?\"\n\"Well, Miss Hondorf. Do you remember I told you my mom was sick? Actually she died this morning. She was born deaf, so tonight was the first time she could hear me play. I wanted to make it special. I knew I could.\"", "id": "high22017.txt"}
