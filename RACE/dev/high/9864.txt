February 7 marked the 200th anniversary of his birthday. Yet for many, his language is old-fashioned and his stories often improbable. So why do so many people know and read Dickens today?\nOne reason is the British government's insistence that every child studies a Dickens novel at school. Alongside William Shakespeare, Dickens is on every English literature school reading list.\nHis stories, though often long by today's standards, are great moral tales. They are filled with colorful characters.\nEarlier this month, a ceremony was held in Portsmouth, where Dickens was born. Prince Charles said at the ceremony, \"Dickens used his creative genius to campaign passionately for social justice... His characterization   is as fresh today as on the day it was written.\"\nHis books stand out from many other writers because of his insight into human nature. Dickens, like Shakespeare, tells us truths about human behavior. They are as true in the 21st century as they were to his readers in the 19th century.\nReaders have returned to Dickens' books again and again over the years to see what he has to say about their own times.\nNo surprise then that it was Dickens whom Britons turned to during the economic crisis in the last couple of years. Dickens helped them make sense of a world that was rapidly falling apart. The BBC adapted one of his less well-known novels, Little Dorrit, into a popular television drama that introduced many Brits to the novel for the first time. A dark story about greed and money, it was the perfect illustration of bad times.\nAs long as Dickens's novels have something to say to modern audiences, it seems likely that he will remain one of Britain's best-loved writers.", "id": "high9864.txt"}
