It's these traits that tend to affect some shy individuals' ability to connect,\" says C. Barr Taylor, a professor of psychology at Stanford University.\n\"But while shyness can often be seen as a bad thing, there are ways to use the personality trait to your advantage,\" Taylor says. Below are some common shy habits and how you can learn to make them benefit you:\nShy people usually reflect inwardly   a lot. But according to Taylor,all that thinking may not always be a bad thing and it should be viewed as a way you can think actively as you go into a situation. So, for shy people who feel worried about facing a particular challenge or event, Taylor advises slowly approaching the fearful situation if you start to feel anxious. By facing what you are not feeling secure about, Taylor says, you will feel less anxious. \"Our brains are amazing--they can become well adapted,\" he says. \"If you put yourself in a fearful situation, you will get a sense that you are going to do it.\" What's more, shy individuals care deeply about what others think of them, and if it is addressed healthily, they can use it to their advantage to form social connections.\nShy people are observant and often pick up on parts of their conversation or surroundings that others may not. \"Just because you are shy, that does not mean you are not used to social situations,\" Taylor says. \"It can actually become a source of strength as you are the observer in the room.\" In a study out of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, researchers found an association between college-age adults who were shy and the ability to better identify expressions of sadness and fear compared with those who weren't shy. In addition, a shy person has a born drive to absorb a conversation, so they can be great at conversation.", "id": "high12290.txt"}
