They are wondering if the food \nthey are eating is clean, healthy and nutritious or does it contain something harmful\nthat will cause disease?\n     Most of the food we eat today is processed food. That means the foods we buy in stores and supermarkets, especially packaged foods, are prepared in factories. Chemicals are added to the foods in these factories to make them look better, taste better and last longer on the shelf. The chemicals are supposed to be harmless and there are laws that regulate which chemicals can and can't be used. Unfortunately, some producers do not obey the laws.\n      A producer of steamed buns in Zhejiang Province was recently discovered to be breaking the law. He was adding yellow dye and other banned chemicals to the buns. He was also taking old buns and using them to make new buns. Most of the buns were sold to schools and eaten by students... like you!\n      Why did he do it? Why did he break the law and endanger people's health? The answer is simple: he wanted to make more money. It was a moral failing, and this is at the heart of the scandals in China. Too many people focus on making money and not on the effects their action can have on others.\n \n. (2,6)", "id": "high18012.txt"}
