There are guided tours every day up this highly active volcano from Antigua, giving travelers a chance to see Mother Nature at her most powerful.\nPacaya is an easy drive from Antigua, a beautiful city with many colorful houses along its old streets that are turned into art-works during its Holy Week festival. No matter when you come to Antigua, you won't miss the Pacaya-tour companies.\nBut climbing Pacaya is no easy job. It is 2,560 meters high, and reaching the peak takes two to three hours of almost one-step-forward and two-step-back movements. As you climb, you hear the dull sounds of eruptions high above. Steaming, hot remains from recent eruptions begin to line the path as you are near the active peak: the McKenney Cone  . Just as though you were going to walk over to the edge of the cone, the road turns to the left and up to the relative safety of the old, inactive peak.\nMany tours are timed so that you arrive at the cone of the volcano in plenty of time for sunset and the full contrast between the erupting red lava and the darkening sky. On a good day the view from the peak is extremely exciting. The active mouth boils, sending red lava over its sides, and once in a while shoots hot streams up to 100 metres into the air.", "id": "high14584.txt"}
