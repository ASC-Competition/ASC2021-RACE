The big question is why.\nThere have been many myths about safety belts ever since their first appearance in cars some forty years ago. The following are three of the most common.\nMyth Number One: It's best to be \"thrown clear\" of a serious accident.\nTruth: Sorry, but any accident serious enough to \"throw you clear\" is also going to be serious enough to give you a very bad landing. And chances are that you'll have traveled through a wind shield  or door to do it. Studies show that chances of dying after a car accident are twenty-five times greater in cases where people are \"thrown clear\".\nMyth Number Two: Safety belts \"trap\" people in cars that are burning or sinking in water.\nTruth: Sorry again, but studies show that people knocked unconscious  due to not wearing safety belts have a greater chance of dying in these accidents. People wearing safety belts are usually protected to the point of having a clear head to free themselves from such dangerous situations, not to be trapped in them.\nMyth Number Three: Safety belts aren't needed at speeds of less than 30 miles per hour.\nTruth: When two cars traveling at 30 mph hit each other, an unbelted driver would meet the windshield with a force equal to diving headfirst into the ground from a height of 10 meters.", "id": "high5198.txt"}
