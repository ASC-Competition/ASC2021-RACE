He would never forget the day when the plane landed. His parents had big smiles on their faces as they discussed the wonderful new life they would have in this great city. His older sister and brother looked in wonder and excitement at the buildings. Uncle Miguel and Aunt Esperanza thought of the good jobs they would get. Grandmother and Grandfather told him what a lucky boy he was to come to this wonderful city. But Carlos was lonely. The city looked big, cold and dirty to him.\nThey lived in an apartment in Manhattan. There were stores and cinemas close to their home. But Carlos didn't want these things. He loved his home in the country in Puerto Rico; he loved the green fields, the hot sun, and the lovely beaches.\nHe didn't want to go to school because it made him think of his friends at home. And he didn't want to learn a new language that he could never describe the world as beautifully as his own.\nHe began to go the dock , because this made him feel closer to Puerto Rico. He sat down and watched the ships. He would often find a man also sitting there looking at the sea. The man was Eric--a taxi driver who came there to escape from the noisy traffic.\nEric noticed the young boy and felt his sadness. One day he said, \"Yes, it's hard to leave your homeland. I remember when I left Norway 15 years ago. I know it's hard to start a new life in a new country, but let's face it. I did it, and you can do it, too.\"\nFrom then on the taxi driver and the young boy began to develop a deep friendship.", "id": "high6331.txt"}
