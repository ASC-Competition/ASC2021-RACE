I love the \"smiling\" pages and the tips on every issue. I am a dog lover and have saved all of my dogs from either death row or from people who were going to put them down. Everyone should have a chance to live and Bark stresses that with its articles. This magazine is a MUST HAVE for any dog lover!!\nDog Fancy\nCover Price: $54.00       Price: $14.99 ($1.25 / issue)\nYou save: $39.01 (72%)    Review: By Berner Mom\nDon't waste your money on this magazine. 60-70 percent of it are advertisements, and the articles offer little useful information. It might be suitable for children, but not adults who are serious about educating themselves about dogs.\nDog World\nCover Price: $48.88       Price: $14.99 ($1.25 / issue)\nYou save: $33.89 (69%)    Review: By one critic\nDog World has many very interesting and thought-provoking   articles for people involved in dog showing, breeding , performance events, etc. However,over half of the magazine is devoted to breeder ads, which is boring. Still, as a whole, I recommend  it for the articles. Good articles, but tons of ads.\nModern Dog\nCover Price: $45.00       Price: $15.00 ($3.75 / issue)\nYou save: $30.00 (24%)    Review: By Dinah\nMy new favorite magazine! Beautiful photos, smart and amusing articles, fashion, art, interviews with famous people... all with a dog focus!Cover models range from Paris Hilton and Tinkerbell to Virginia Madsen and her dogs. Thanks to Modern Dog I now know how to give a dog-friendly cocktail party and how to actually get my dog to come when she's called. Surely worth checking out.", "id": "high11838.txt"}
