You can't find a parking place, and the traffic jams are terrible.\" Everyone is worried about crime, \"The city is full of criminals-it's toodangerous.\"\nFor them, the rural  life is a cure for all problems, green grass, flowers, swimming pools, barbecues, and so on. Yet after they have lived there for a year or so, they realize that rural life is not so pleasant as they were expecting. Why? Their gardens! They soon learn that the main part of rural life is yard work . After they work all weekend in their gardens, they're too tired to swim in their pools or cook some meat on their barbecues. And they can't live in the countryside without a car. Most of them moved to the countryside to avoid traffic, but now they're blocked on a busy freeway two hours every day to drive to work downtown.\nMy opinions about urban life are different-I love to live downtown!  Why? First, in the city,  I can enjoy nature. I can walk through the park. smell. the flowers, sit on the grass and visit the animals in the zoo. Yet I don't have to do yard work or feed the animals. Also, I can get everywhere by bus; if there is a traffic jam, I can walk home. I think the criminal life will reflect changes in society too; if people are buying homes outside the city, the criminals will soon follow. Criminals want to avoid noise, smog, and pollution, too. Then, overcrowding and crime will be problems of the suburbs instead of the city!", "id": "high13250.txt"}
