The park itself covers an area of around 2,850 square kilometers, making it the sixth largest park of its kind in the country. I recently visited it to see what it was like.\nOne of the first sightings upon entering the park I found was a huge group of elephants. Our guide told us Tarangire was probably the best place in Tanzania to find large groups of elephants. We continued to watch the elephants as they stood under trees and scratched themselves against the trees to hit the spot of an itch .\nTo the right of the elephant group, we noticed a big tree. Our guide informed us that this was a baobab tree and that Tarangire was one of the best national parks in Africa to see so many baobab trees.\nAs we continued our drive through the park, we finally reached a watering hole. Our guide warned us there were lions all around us. Most of them were resting in the shade under bushes, but there was one that was drinking from the watering hole directly in front of us. We then noticed there were a couple of fresh zebra corpses --it seemed as if the resting lions had killed them!\nOur final big sighting was one that none of us were expecting to see!We pulled over to where there was a large gathering of cars, with a sleeping leopard there!We took photos happily and excitedly and observed its surprising body before returning to our hotel as it was getting late.\nSo I hope you enjoyed my description of Tarangire,and that I've inspired you to add this amazing park to your very own Tanzania travel plan.", "id": "high7190.txt"}
