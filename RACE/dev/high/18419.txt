Think of the world as a giant pizza. Without all the different vegetables, cheeses and meats, all you get is a tasteless pizza crust  . But when you put them all together, you get something very interesting, tasty, and good. So let's break down the walls between cultures.\nOne way to help break down the walls between us is to understand that many of our ancestors may come from the same place. Do you know what cultures you are from? Are you part Irish or mostly German? Did your grandparents or great-grandparents immigrate   to your country? \nThere is really no way to be completely sure where your first ancestors came from, but some scientists think that all people came from Africa. So how did they get all over the world? Well, back then there was a land bridge connecting Asia and North America, so they walked to Asia, Europe, and the Americas! Over time, the land bridge split up, and there was no way for people like Columbus to know that the Americas existed. Isn't it cool thinking that maybe we're all from the same continent? Even though we all came from the same place, now there are differences in the way we look depending on where our recent ancestors came from and who our parents are. If you find out where your parents and grandparents came from, you just might discover that you are from the same culture that you might be trying to avoid!", "id": "high18419.txt"}
