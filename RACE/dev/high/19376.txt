It was Thursday, and like every Thursday, I was exhausted end just sick of everyone and everything.\n\"Mommy?\" asked my older daughter.\n\" What?\" I practically shouted. Could' t they just eat without demanding anything? \" It seems that the spaghetti is overcooked,\" she said.\nI glanced at my husband, and he just gave a slight nod in agreement with ray daughter. Why could' t I even cook something simple as spaghetti? Then I remembered why. Because every time I was trying to gel dinner cooked, I could be distracted  by so many other things. I hung my head in defeat once again. Sometimes, I just wanted to cry. Throughout my journey in motherhood, 1 have concluded that my abilities are an   failure at times.
