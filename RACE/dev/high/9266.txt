Was it noisy or peaceful? It might not seem important, but a growing body of research suggests that smells and sounds can have an impact on learning, performance and creativity.\nBridget Shield has been conducting studies and advising people on the effects of all sorts of noises, such as traffic and sirens, as well as noise made by the children themselves. \"Everything points to a harmful impact of the noise on children's performance, in numeracy, in literacy, and in spelling,\" says Shield.\nShield says the sound of \"babble\" -the chatter of other children, is particularly distracting in the classroom.. People are very distracted by speech-particularly if it is understandable, but you're not involved in it.\" This phenomenon is also known as the irrelevant speech effect, she says, adding that \"it's a very common finding in open-plan offices as well.''\nIn a series of studies published last year, Ravi Mehta found that people were more creative when the background noises were played at a medium level than when volume was low. Loud background noise, however, damaged their creativity. Ravi Mehta suggests there maybe some benefit to playing music or other sounds in an art class or other situations where creativity is the key.\nMany teachers all over the world already play music to students in class. Many are inspired by the belief that hearing music can boost IQ in their tasks, the so-called Mozart effect. While the evidence actually suggests it's a guess to say classical music boosts brainpower, researchers do think pleasant sounds before a task can sometimes lift your mood and help you perform well, says Ravi Mehta,\" If you like the music or you like the sound-even listening to a Stephen King novel-then you did better. It didn't matter about the music,\" he says.\nHowever, it's worth considering that music is not always helpful while you're trying to work. Trying to perform a task which involves serial recall - for instance, doing mental mathematics-will be distracted by sounds with audio variation, says Ravi Mehta. Songs with lyrics, on the other hand, are more likely to interfere with tasks that involve languages-such as reading comprehension.\nThis isn't the only sense being related to affecting learning.", "id": "high9266.txt"}
