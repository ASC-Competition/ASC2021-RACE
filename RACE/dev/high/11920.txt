Coming my way from across the parking lot was what society would consider a bum  . From the looks of him, he had no car, no home, no clean clothes, and no money. There are times when you feel generous but there are other times that you just don't want to be bothered  . This was one of those \"don't want to be bothered times.\"\n\"I hope he doesn't ask me for any money,\" I thought. He didn't. He came and sat on the seat by the bus stop but he didn't look like he could have enough money to even ride the bus. After a few minutes he spoke, \"That's a very pretty car\". He was ragged   but he had an air of dignity   around him. I said, \"thanks,\" without taking a look at him.\nHe sat there quietly for a moment. The expected begging for money never came. As the silence between us widened something inside said, \"Ask him if he needs any help.\" I was sure that he would say \"yes\". So I asked, \"Do you need any help?\" He answered in three simple words that I shall never forget. The three words shook me. \"Don't we all?\" he said.\nI was feeling successful and important, above a bum in the street, until those three words hit me. Don't we all? I needed help. Maybe not for bus fare or a place to sleep, but I needed help. I reached in my wallet and gave him not only enough for bus fare, but enough to get a warm meal and shelter for the day. Those three little words still ring true. No matter how much you have, you need help too. However, no matter how little you have, you can give help too.", "id": "high11920.txt"}
