I didn't eat much over the weekend because I moved into a new place and was very busy. It looked as if I had drunk too much wine, and suddenly the world began to sway and then went black. All I heard was \"Oh my god, she's falling.\" The next thing I remembered was that the EMT  was asking me my name. I was taken to the hospital by an ambulance. It turned out that I was too tired. The EMT came to check on me before I left. \n   He told me that a gentleman at the station waiting for the train saw me fall on the track when the train was coming in. He immediately got to my side and made sure that everyone kept back. He got the conductor's attention and the train stopped, and told others in the station to call 911. I was told that he stayed with me until the ambulance arrived. I asked the EMT if he had the gentleman's name or address but he said no, he said the gentleman left the hospital without a word.\n   I don't know who this gentleman is but if he reads this article and remembers a young lady fainting at the train station, I'd like him to get in touch with me and I will say \"Thank you\" to him to his face. Whenever I meet with such a thing I will do the same as he did for me and I'll pass on the kindness to others.", "id": "high22309.txt"}
