We don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happened within 20 miles from our home, so we moved.\nI won't be able to send you the address because the last family that lived here took the house numbers when they moved so that they wouldn't have to change their address. This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though: last week I put a load in and pulled the chain   and haven't seen them since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days.

We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out. Your sister had a baby this morning, but I haven't found out what _ is yet. The baby looks just like your brother.\nUncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.\nThree of your friends went off a bridge in a pick-up trunk. Ralph was driving. He rolled down the window and swam to safety. You other two friends were in back. They drowned because they couldn't get the tail gate down.\nThere isn't much more news at this time. Nothing much has happened.\nLove,\nMom\nP.S. I was going to send you some money but the envelope was already sealed.", "id": "high353.txt"}
