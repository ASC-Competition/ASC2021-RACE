However,I found out later it was truly \"an awakening\" for me,especially after being diagnosed with colon cancer a few years later,but still alive to tell about them both.I began to question God.Why was I chosen to suffer this double challenge?What had I done in life so bad to have this placed upon me?I was unhappy with the way I look and the intolerant pain I had to experience each day,but instead of sighing over my fate,I decided to look on the positive sides of it.\nI knew that I was about to face a new beginning,new hope,do and see more with a whole new perspective on life.I also began thinking of the individuals that are no longer among us and how there will always be someone worse off than I am.Who am I to complain?I still have my life.\nDuring my treatments,I experienced something of a miracle that I had to write down.I took that experience and turned it into a poem and I called it \"Peace\".I took that poem along with many others I had composed during my breast cancer period and submitted them for publication.The book of poems was accepted and published under the title \"True Simple Poems of Life,Faith and Survival\".\nI continue to write and hope that my poetry may encourage other unfortunate people and my writing continues to give me strength.I've had another inspirational children's book published called \"If Only I Could Fly,Said Mattiebee\".\nI would never have become a writer,producing inspirational stories,if I had not gone through all that I did.I'm a true example that you can survive cancer,not once,but twice,providing that you catch it in time.It won't all be easy,but you must have faith and allow that faith to direct your path.\nI truly believe when you survive a terrible tragedy or a horrible disease like cancer,it's for a reason--you have a purpose,and I want to live and find out exactly what that is for me.", "id": "high5784.txt"}
