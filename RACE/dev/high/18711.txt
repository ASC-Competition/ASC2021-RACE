However, last month, Soraya Lamilla died, after givinast cancer  each year. Latino musician Soraya was among those women who countless other women hope for recovery. She was 37. Soraya Lamilla was born in the state of New Jersey in 1969. Her parents had come to the United States from Colombia. Soraya discovered her interest in music early in life. She began studying the guitar when she was five. She was playing the violin at the age of eight. Her family often traveled between Colombia and the United States. Soraya's music was a mix of those cultures. In fact, she released both Spanish and English versions of her first two albums. This Latin Grammy winner had big plans for her musical career in June of 2000. She had released her third album and was about to launch a two-year tour to promote it. But when she found a lump  in her breast, none of those plans mattered. She had a new mission --to take care of her health and help other women understand the cancer that had already taken her mother, aunt and grandmother. Soraya began to work as a spokeswoman for the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, giving hope to women who, like herself, suffered from this illness. Soraya also spent much of her time spreading the message of the importance of breast examination and treatment.
