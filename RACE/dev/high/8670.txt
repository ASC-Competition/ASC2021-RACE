Even silence means different things in different places.\nWhen trying to communicate in a foreign language, it's natural to use gestures as a way of explaining your points.\nTapping your finger to your temple is a gesture to show memory in North America, but suggests insanity in Russia. Even nodding one's head to show \"yes\" or shaking one's head to show \"no\" can be misunderstood abroad. The yes-no gestures are different in countries like Bulgaria and Albania. In Turkey, \"no\" is gestured by nodding the head up and down.\nIt's not just individual gestures that can cause miscommunication, but the rate of gesturing can also cause miscommunication. Some countries, like Italy and Spain, are known for talking with their hands. Others use few body movements as a form of politeness. In parts of East Asia, the gesture is considered unpleasant behavior, and even rude.\nBritain, along with many countries of northern Europe and the Far East, is classed as a \"non-contact\"culture, in which there's very little physical contact in people's daily communication. Even accidentally touching someone's arm is considered rude. By comparison, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of socializing.\nNaturally, these different standards of contact can lead to misunderstanding. An Argentinian may see a Scandinavian as cold, while the Scandinavian may see the Argentinian as impolite.\nIn most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness. But in many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, however, unbroken eye contact would be considered rude. These cultures tend to pay more attention to hierarchy , and avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect for bosses and elder. In these parts of the world, children won't look at an adult who is speaking to them, and nor will employees to their bosses.", "id": "high8670.txt"}
