When children are little we make them read aloud, before the teacher and other children, so that we can be sure they \"know\" all the words they are reading. This means that when they don't know a word, they are going to make a mistake, right in front of everyone. After having taught fifth-grade classes for four years, I decided to try at all costs to rid them of their fear and dislike of books, and to get them to read oftener and more adventurously.\nOne day soon after school had started, I said to them, \"Now I'm going to say something about reading that you have probably never heard a teacher say before. I would like you to read a lot of  books this year, but I want you to read them only for pleasure. I am not going to ask you questions to find out whether you understand the books or not. If you understand enough of a book to enjoy it and want to go on reading it, that's enough for me. Also I'm not going to ask you what words mean. \"\nThe children sat stunned and silent. Was this a teacher talking? One girl, who had just come to us from a school where she had had a very hard time, looked at me steadily for a long time after I had finished. Then, still looking at me, she said slowly and seriously, Mr Holt, do you really mean that?\" I said just as seriously, \"I mean every word of it.\nDuring the spring she really astonished me. One day, she was reading at her desk, From a glimpse of the illustrations I thought I knew what the book was. I said to myself, \"It can't be,\" and went to take a closer look. Sure enough, she was reading Moby Dick , in edition with woodcuts. I said, \"Don't you find parts of it rather heavy going?\" She answered, Oh, sure, but I just skip over those parts and go on to the next good part. \"\nThis is exactly what reading should be and in school so seldom is, an exciting, joyous adventure. Find something, dive into it, take the good parts, skip the bad parts, get what you can out of it, go on to something else. How different is our mean-spirited, picky insistence that every child get every last little scrap of \"understanding\" that can be dug out of a book.", "id": "high10261.txt"}
