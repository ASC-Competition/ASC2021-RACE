At home, he asked his mom, \"Am I more stupid than other kids? How come I always lag behind? I just can't come up with an answer.\" Mom was aware that her son's self-respect had been damaged by the ranking system, but she didn't know what to say to help.\nShe was tempted   to say that intelligence differs and that yes, her son's friend really was the smarter boy. But that would have so upset her son. Thank goodness she resisted the temptation to say it.\nHer son and his friend went on to high school that year, but despite trying as hard as he could, her son's friend still outdid him. But she was proud of her boy for his hard work, sincerely proud. It was around this time she decided to take him on a trip to the seaside. On the trip, she at last found an answer for him.\nToday her son no longer cares about rankings. He doesn't have to, for he himself is now the top of the class - at the top national university he attends. Invited to speak to his old high school, he mentioned a valuable childhood experience: \"Once, on a trip to the sea, my mother and I were lying on the beach. She pointed to the sea and said to me: 'Do you see the seabirds fighting for food out there? When a wave comes near, the little birds rise quickly. The \"clumsy\" seagulls   are far less agile   and have to struggle to get away from the wave. But these \"clumsy\" birds prove to have the biggest, strongest wings, which open the widest and allow the bird to travel the furthest. When the season changes, they leave for foreign shores, leaving the little birds behind. Son, I have a feeling that you are one of those seagulls.\"", "id": "high1149.txt"}
