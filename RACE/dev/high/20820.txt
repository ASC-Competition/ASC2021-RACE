But the Global Text Project hopes to create a free library of one thousand electronic textbooks for students in developing countries.\n  The aim is to offer subjects that students may take in their first few years at university. The books could be printed or read on a computer or copied onto a CD or DVD.\n  Richard Watson is the acting head of the department of management information systems at the University of Georgia,who says the idea goes back several years. He was teaching a computer programming class but did not have a good textbook. So he asked his students each to write part of the book that he would organize and edit. By the end of the term, Professor Watson had a finished product. Since then he has used it for other classes. Now, Professor Watson is seeking volunteers to supervise  the creation of books for the library. He is looking for professors or other professionals.\n  The Global Text Project is similar in technology to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (a reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects) that anyone can edit on the Internet. But only one or two people will be able to make the final edits in texts. \n  The project includes a committee  of scholars, mostly from developing countries, to advise on required textbooks and their contents.\n  The group's first book on information systems is being tested in Ethiopia and Indonesia. The plan is to offer about ten free books within the next year, including an English grammar text. Project organizers also want to offer textbooks in Arabic, Chinese and Spanish. They are working with a translation company and students could also get involved. For example, a student learning English in an Arab country could translate part of a book into Arabic. Then another student and the class professor could check the translation.", "id": "high20820.txt"}
