That's part of the idea behind an upcoming bookless public library in San Antonio. Called Biblio Tech, the system will lend out e-readers loaded with 10,000 titles for two-to-three -week periods. But don't bother holding on to the device longer than that because it's programmed to go dead.\nOther libraries have tried similar programs: In 2002, the Santa Rosa Branch Library in Tucson, Arizona, launched a digital-only facility, and a bookless project was proposed last year in Newport Beach, California. Those digital-only projects _ --residents wanted their paperbacks--but Stanford University maintains a successful bookless engineering library with over 65,000 titles. Officials say digital libraries are a low-cost way to educate the masses and argue their rise is inevitable.\nStill, some insist print isn't doomed.
