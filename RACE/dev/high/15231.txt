No specific purpose in mind, just an opportunity to sit at the kitchen table, have some tea and chat. As I did so, it occurred to me how rare the Sunday visit has become.\nWhen I was a kid in the New Jersey of the 1960s, Sunday visits were routine. Most stores were closed and almost nobody worked. My family normally traveled eight city blocks to the home of my grandmother, where adults would sit on the front porch and chat while we children played hide-and-seek.\nThe Sunday visit was something to desire strongly. It was the repetition to church, our reward for and hour of devotion, and opportunity to take advantage of the fact that Dad was not at work, we were not in school, and there were no chores that couldn't wait until Monday. Sunday was, indeed, which means that there was one day when everyone seemed to have time for everybody else.\nSunday as a day of rest is, or was, so deeply rooted in the culture that it's surprising to consider that, in a short span of time, it has almost entirely lost this association.1In my childhood, it was assumed that everyone would either be home or visit someone else's home on Sunday. But now the question is, \"What do you plan to Do this Sunday?\" The answer can range from going to the mall to participating in a road to jetting to Montreal for lunch. _ \nI suppose I should be grateful to live in Maine, a state of small towns, abundant land tight relationships. Even though folks work as hard here as they do anywhere else, the state's powerfully rural cast still harbors at least remnants of the ethic of yesterday's America, where people had to depend on one another in the face of economic vagaries and a challenging environment.2", "id": "high15231.txt"}
