Most people who do this job say they love their work because it is very rewarding and varied. They work not only inside a laboratory, but also out in the field. Fieldwork includes traveling to rivers, oceans and lakes in order to collect information and specimens. Reading, writing and speaking are also very important to the job. Fish scientists need to read the research of other scientists. They must be able to write up their own research clearly so that others can follow it. They also need to be able to give lectures about their findings, so that they can spread knowledge.\nIchthyologists who wish to specialize can choose any one of three areas of study. The first area is aquaculture. This involves the study and practice of fish farming and management. Because it is a rather new study, there are very few job opportunities available. However, as there is so much to discover, many see it as an exciting area for a new ichthyologist to enter. The second area is fisheries science, which means working with a team of scientists to find out more about different fish species. The third area is about the protection of natural fish populations. This is very important today, given that many fish species are in danger of dying out because of the actions of humans.\nTo become a successful fish scientist, you need to have a curious mind and be able to work on your own. You also need to be able to handle equipment and perform experiments; but most importantly, you must love fish. To become an ichthyologist, you will need to train at a university to pass a Bachelor of Science degree. For this, you will need to be good at mathematics, physical science and biology. Then, you will need to study for another year to complete an honors degree in ichthyology. This honors degree contains coursework about all aspects of fish. You also need to complete a research paper.", "id": "high16596.txt"}
