He was _ . He never lost his baby teeth, never grew taller than about 30 inches and never weighed more than 28 pounds. They did estimate, however, that he would not live to see his 12th birthday.\nAs a boy I learned to feed and clothe Mike. As a teenager, I babysat for my \"big brother\" and learned use the proper medicine to prevent the seizures  that caused him to tremble.\nMany people said he would never walk or talk . He never did learn to walk, but he did learn to talk  --not even in complete sentences, but he had the basics down. If he was hungry, thirsty, happy or sad, we knew. He knew names too. I was Kagun, not Kevin. But that changed with a beard I grew during the summer before college. Family members said it was ugly. Mike heard it.\n\"Look who's at home. Who's that?\" they'd say to Mike. \"Ugly,\" he would respond with delight.\nAll of which--to me--was normal, for he was the only brother I knew. The only time I thought of the differences between us was when others pointed them out. \nMy circle of friends widened when I entered high school. One day Mom asked if my new friends would have a problem seeing Mike for the first time. \"If they don't accept Mike, they don't accept me and they aren't welcome,\" I said.\nAnd if I didn't think of him as different, I never thought about him dying either. On a warm fall night in 1998, Mike had a seizure. With this first seizure, Mike's life was beginning to fade. \nOn March 15, 1999, Mike died. Michael Patrick Harter--just 26 years old-- died in Mom's arms. \nWe never had those great talks other brothers have about women, work and parents. We never played catch or talked about our dreams. But Mike taught me compassion and strength. He taught me respect for those less fortunate than myself. And he taught me an appreciation of the beauty in the simplest things.\nPhysically and mentally, I was my brother's keeper. Spiritually, Mike was and is my keeper--a nearly silent guardian angel.", "id": "high21117.txt"}
