Why do they use pig and pork, cow and beef, and sheep and mutton? To find it out, we have to go back to 1066, when the Norman French invaded England and put a French king on the English throne  , which not only changed the government but also changed the language. French became the language of the upper classes of society. And it remained that way for 300 years. Only these high society people could afford to eat meat. As a result, French words like porc (pork) and beouf (beef) came into the English language. However, poor English farmers raised the animals. So the English language _ the words pig and cow from the Native Anglo-Saxon.\nThe Norman French added about 10,000 French words to the English language. Seventy-five percent of them are still in use today.\nIn French grammar, nouns have either a male or female gender  , so adjectives   take different forms for each. English has only one adjective that does this, and it came from French. The word \"blond\" describes someone with light-colored hair. \"Blond\" is used for men, and \"blonde\" describes women. And they are also nouns.\nSome French words that entered the English language have taken on completely different meanings. The French phrase \"a la mode\" means \"in style\". In English, the phrase means \"with the ice cream\". Someone must have decided something eaten with ice cream was in style!\nNow, as you learn English, you're on your way to learning French!", "id": "high6053.txt"}
