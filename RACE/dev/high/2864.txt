My mother, Margaret Feiddman, died at the age of 89, and so this is my first Mother's Day without my mom.\nIn my childhood, my mom appeared to be a typical suburban housewife of her generation. She sewed many of my sisters' clothes, including both of their wedding dresses and boy's suits for me. And on the side, she won several national bridge tournaments .\nMy mom left many indelible marks on me. The first was to never lose heart and to be independent. My dad died suddenly when I was 19. My mom worked hard for a couple of years. But in1975, I won a scholarship to study in Britain and my mom surprised us all by announcing that she decided to go with me. When I met difficulties, she always said: \"You're a man, so never lose heart, never be knocked down, and try your best to pursue  your dreams.\"\nMy mom's other big influence on me is a sense of optimism. She had taken her knocks. But every time life knocked her down, she got up and kept on marching forward, encouraged by the saying that pessimists  are usually right, optimists are usually wrong, but most great changes are made by optimists.\nHow I wish to listen to my mother's words, and give my best regards on this Mother's Day, but I have no chance now! My best friends, treasure your mother's love!", "id": "high2864.txt"}
