It's time for the arctic ground squirrel  to get her underground home ready. She chooses a quiet spot, hidden from wolves and foxes. She gathers grass and fur to keep her home warm.\nWinter is long and cold in northern Canada. Many days, the air is colder than the air in your freezer. Plants can't grow, so there are no leaves or grass for animals to eat. They must find other ways to live. The arctic ground squirrel \"sleeps\" the winter away.\nFor months the ground squirrel has been eating lots of seeds, mushrooms, and berries. Now she is fat. The extra fat will keep her alive through the winter.\nAt last she crawls through a tunnel into the nest she has made. She curls up, wraps her tail around herself, and goes to \"sleep\". Only she won't really be sleeping. She will be hibernating .\nThe ground squirrel's body is usually as warm as yours. When she hibernates, her body becomes just colder than ice, but she doesn't freeze. In the warm season, when the ground squirrel is active, she uses most of the food she eats to make heat to stay warm. When she hibernates, she doesn't need much food.\nHer heart beats just one or two times each minute. She will take only about three breaths each minute. She won't move, even if someone touches her or shines a light into her eyes.\nThese changes in the ground squirrel's body let her live through the winter.\nThe ground squirrel will not stay in hibernation all winter. Her body warms up and becomes active for a few hours once every few weeks. Over the winter, these active times use up more than half of the energy that she worked so hard to store. Why does she do this?\nScientists aren't sure. Some think arctic ground squirrels must warm up in case their bodies\nneed to fight off any germs  that would make them sick.\nIn April or May the arctic ground squirrel will stop hibernating. She will be skinny because she did not eat anything during the winter. Now she will have just a few months to have babies and fatten up before winter comes again.", "id": "high19457.txt"}
