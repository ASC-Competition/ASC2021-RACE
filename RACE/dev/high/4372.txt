The vicious circle is thus transformed into a virtuous circle  .\nFew will argue that educating women has great social benefits.But it has enormous economic advantages as well.Most obviously, there is the direct effect of education on the wages of female workers.Wages rise by 10 to 20 per cent for each additional year of schooling.Such big returns are impressive by the standard of other available deal, but they are just the beginning.Educating women also has a significant impact on health practices, including family planning.", "id": "high4372.txt"}
