Despite their siesta habit,Spanish rank only third after Americans, who sleep more than 8.5 hours. And while more and more French people prefer fast-food chains these days or wolf down a sandwich at their desk, they still spend more than two hour's a day eating.\nThat means their meals are twice as long as those of the average Mexican, who spends just an hour a day on food,the OECD's \"Society at a Glance\" report on work, health and leisure  in Asia, Europe and North and South America found. The Japanese manage to spend close to 2 hours a day eating and drinking, placing them third behind New Zealanders.\nDespite the limited time, Americans spend eating each day---about an hour and a quarter---U.S.obesity  rates are the highest in the 30 members of OECD. The Japanese like to spend their rare free time watching TV or listening to the radio. This takes up 47 percent of leisure time in Japan. Norwegians spend the most time at leisure,just over a quarter of their day,while at the low end,Mexicans spend just 16 percent of their time having fun.\nThe OECD has 30 members. The survey covers only the countries for which proper figures were available.", "id": "high7944.txt"}
