Despite the obvious challenges---the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, the threat from terrorists in Nigeria----Africa's major new tendency is of a continent on the rise.\nAccording to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa's GDP growth rate of 5% over the past 15 years---almost double the global average--is expected to continue well into the next decade.
