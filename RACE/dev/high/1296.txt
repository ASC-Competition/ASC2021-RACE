Whether in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, or at the well-known underground city, a strong sense of pride in Turkey can be found everywhere in his descriptions and explanations.\nTurkey's location in the Middle East brings many concerns, especially relating to security, for foreign tourists. And every time foreign tourists change their fixed and somewhat negative views about Turkey on his tour, Ali feels that all his efforts have paid off.\nAli Dede Coskuner, Tour Guide, said, \"Guide makes bridge of peace, tourism brings peace to the world.\"\nAside from work, the biggest comfort for Ali is his happy family, with three sons and a loving wife. But as a tour guide, his time with his family is destined to be very limited.\nAli Dede Coskuner said, \"Tour guide is no timing; you don't have fixed time to work. Sometimes, you have to work for 14--15 hours; sometimes, even more than 18 hours, and you can't say 'I am tired.'\"\nDespite these challenges, Ali always sees the beauty of the job that he does. And his smiling face always makes him an _ host for his guests.\nAccording to Ali, there are about 10 thousand tour guides throughout Turkey, with only five thousand who are active. Because of certain legal loopholes , not all the tour guides are licensed professionals, which results in some unfair competition. At the same time, tour guiding in Turkey is still not recognized as a profession, so guides are not included in the country's insurance system.", "id": "high1296.txt"}
