Having a black cat cross your path, walking under a ladder, and breaking a mirror are all bad luck. In addition to these, there are many other superstitions that are worth knowing. Understanding them will keep you safe from evil spirits--if you believe in such things--and impress your American friends when you mention them.\nLike the superstitions in other cultures, American superstitions often involve the things important in daily life, such as health, numbers, and marriage. For example, have you ever had a cough that would not go away? According to one American superstition, you should take a piece of your hair and put it between two slices of buttered bread. Next, feed this hair sandwich to a dog and say, \"Eat well, you hound, may you be sick and I be sound.\"This will trick the evil spirits and help your cough. _ .\nIn American superstitions, the number three is very important. Often, Americans will say, \"All things come in threes.\" Three is lucky because it represents the traditional family: mother, father, and child. Therefore, gifts, letters, and guests will often arrive at your home in groups of three. However, it is also possible for bad events, like accidents and funerals, to come in threes as well.\nAnother time people pay attention to superstitions is when they get married. During a wedding, brides must wear or carry\"something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.\"The old and borrowed things will bring luck to the person who gives them to the bride. The new and blue things will bring good fortune to the bride herself. The next time someone you know is getting married, be sure to recite this phrase.\nAs it would be unlucky to discuss one more superstition, we will wind things up here. Keep your fingers crossed, and stay lucky!", "id": "high10897.txt"}
