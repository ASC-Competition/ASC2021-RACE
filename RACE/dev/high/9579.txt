I was riding with some friends, and a bottle was passed around the car. Everyone was taking swigs . When the bottle got to me, I thought:\"What should I do?\"I took a swig. It was the biggest mistake of my life. I had to drive home later that night.\nI went back to my car, got in and drove off. At a stop sign I saw a policeman sitting in the parking lot across the street. His headlights were turned on, and I knew he was going to follow me. Then he flashed his lights at me. All I could think was: \"Oh no, that swig!\"\nI pulled over and waited for him to come to my door. It felt like forever. \"Can I see your license and registration, please, Miss?\" I gave them to him. He took them and went back to his car for a while. When he returned, he asked if I had been drinking.\n\"No,\" I said. He asked me to step out of my car.\n\"Walk heel to toe down the white line, please.\" I passed the test. Next he had me stand on my left foot, lift my right foot and hold it for 30 seconds. I'm not the most coordinated   person and I can't even walk and chew gum at the same time, so, needless to say, I didn't pass. Then he asked me to take a breathalyzer test.\nThat was where I messed up. I told him I didn't want to and didn't understand why I had to. The officer asked me three more times, and I continued to refuse. He told me to turn around and place my hands behind my back. He arrested me right then and there.\nThe policeman drove me to a police station 20 minutes from my home. He called my parents and told them where I was.\nI went to court two months after that, charged with refusing to obey an officer. I got a $700 (4,340 yuan) fine and 40 hours of community service. I'll be on probation   for a year, and I'll have to take the driving test again. I lost my license for a whole year.\nThis was a huge learning experience for me. It opened my eyes to how easy it is to make a stupid decision. I want everyone reading this to know that it's not right to drink and drive. It definitely isn't worth losing your license over.", "id": "high9579.txt"}
