He and three other students are sitting back to back. They're all wearing earphones and staring at a computer screen, talking to each other only in words like \"charge\" or \"retreat\". Chen Jiasheng, 22, a senior majoring in electrical engineering and automation at Beijing University of Aeronautics & Astronautics, is a gaming team leader. \" Online gaming is not just about gaming, it's a community in which we communicate with each other using our avatars ,\" said Chen. For university students like Chen, online gaming has become more than a fashion - it's part of life and a way of socializing.\nA 2012 research report on online gamers in China released by 17173.com, the country's leading game information portal, supports this concept. According to the report, university students aged between 19 and 25 make up 58 percent of online gamers, and the proportion is rising every year. \"Many of my friends spend more time hanging out in online gaming worlds than in reality,\" said Wang Jiaming, 21, a junior law major at China University of Political Sciences and Law. \"Personally I feel more powerful in virtual worlds than in real life. I'm more confident.\"\nAccording to Zhang Quan, 20, a student in the second year economics major at Renmin University of China, one of the distinguishing features of online games compared with offline games is the gaming experience. Offline games test a gamer's skill at using a keyboard to beat _ . \"Online games are technically more accessible as you don't have to master these skills,\" said Zhang.\nBut most online games are based on avatars controlled by another human - they are unavoidably more tricky and unpredictable by a computer. \"On the surface we are playing games, but actually it's real people we are dealing with,\" added Zhang. \"The only difference is that in these games we communicate with each other in different settings, like wars, magic battles and fantasy worlds.\"\nBy engaging in this interactive gaming experience, gamers become team players and promote their social skills. Chen has even made friends by playing in a team with strangers online. \"We coordinated our movements and cooperated with each other to win a battle in the cyberspace. The game was virtual but the brotherhood was real. Most of us are good friends in real life,\" said Chen.", "id": "high9168.txt"}
