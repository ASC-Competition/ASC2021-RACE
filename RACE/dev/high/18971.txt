Now San Francisco-based company Lava Mae, is trying to change that with a simple but smart idea--turning retired city buses into mobile showers for the homeless. The idea known as Lava Mae, is a response to the need of the homeless in the city.\nIt all started two years ago when Sandoval got in a cab after a meeting in the SoMa district of San Francisco, where the homeless mainly lived. \"My driver turned around and said, 'Welcome to the land of broken dreams.' \" Then Sandoval awoke from her imagination and started really look at the people around her. \" A woman I passed was crying and saying that she would never be clean\", Sandoval said. She took what the woman said as a sign that she should focus on the problem of hygiene , one of the most pressing needs for the homeless. \nAfter doing some research, Sandoval hit on the idea of a mobile unit that could be equipped with shower facilities. According to the company's founder Doniece Sandoval, every bus will be renewed and equipped with two separate private areas, each with a shower stall, sink, changing areas, toilet and bench. Sandoval says that if everyone sticks to a five-minute shower, a single Lava Mae bus could provide service for about 100 people during each 8- to 10-hour shift. \nThe project has been several years in the making as it has not been easy to get officials to agree. In addition, it is also difficult to ask the bus company to donate buses. Now she has reached an agreement with a bus company, which will donate the buses being retired in the next four years. \nWhile Lava Mae is now focused on the city of San Francisco, there is no reason that the idea cannot be spread all over the world.", "id": "high18971.txt"}
