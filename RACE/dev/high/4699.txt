She spent 10 months in the UK last year, studying English at a language school. She really enjoyed her first two weeks in the UK. But soon she started to miss things of her own country. She found it hard to make friends,and got annoyed  about local people's behaviour.  Mami said,\"After a few weeks I started to cry a lot. I felt homesick.I thought the weather was dark and too changeable,and that affected my mood as well.\"\nTo comfort herself Mami began to spend many hours on the Internet chatting with her friends back home. She spent a couple of weeks in the countryside in Kent. She went to a social club for British people who were interested in Japan and started to make some friends there. In addition,  she took a short course in calligraphy to get an opportunity of mixing with local people. A few months later,Mami's impression of the UK had greatly changed .She found that most of the British were friendly, witty and fun.\nHowever,once Mami was back in Japan,she experienced \"culture shock\"again. She said,\"I missed the friends I had made in England. My way of thinking had changed. Sometimes I was annoyed by the views of people in my country--for example,about the value of money and time. I thought people around me lived in such a small world.\" Mami noticed some changes in her behaviour:\"I kept the habit of always carrying an umbrella with me, even on a fine day--my friends thought I was crazy!\"", "id": "high4699.txt"}
