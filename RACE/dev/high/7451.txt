You're not alone! Many single travelers wonder which voyage will have the most singles on board, how they'll meet other singles, what the voyage will cost and whether they'll enjoy themselves.\nOur hosted singles voyage is ideal for singles of all ages. No other form of travel affords as many opportunities to meet people and make friends. In fact, our Singles Division can help you find a singles voyage on a ship that's just right for you and make sure you meet many other singles on board.\nWe've scheduled singles voyage on sailings throughout 2005, to all of the world's greatest destinations. And we've selected popular itineraries on large, newer ships for different audiences, so you can find one that suits your tastes.\nIf you're looking for a roommate to cut costs, our Match Program can pair you with a samesex single in one stateroom(on hosted sailings only),enabling us to offer you the same perperson pricing that couples receive. We guarantee to find you a roommate, whenever you signup before the cutoff date. If we don't, you only need pay the perperson, doubleoccupancy rate. If you prefer the privacy of your own stateroom, the single supplement rates will apply.\nEither way, we'll provide our own onboard host to organize singles cocktail parties, mixers, games, singlemingle dining and more. Once you've booked your voyage, we'll also give you private access to our singles chat site where you can get to know other singles before you depart.\nWe expect our staterooms on these sailings will fill quickly, so please book early to avoid disappointment.
