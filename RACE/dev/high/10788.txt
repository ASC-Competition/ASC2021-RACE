For example, 80% of e-mails on the internet are in English. But where will English be at the end of the 21stcentury?\nOne view is that English is going to become even more important as a global language, being most widely used in trade and media while some other languages will become less important or just disappear. Another view is that English is already breaking up into several separate languages. There are already dictionaries of the \"New Englishes\", such as Australian English, full of words that a British English speaker would not recognize.\nHopefully, neither of these things will happen. Although different varieties of English will continue to develop around the world, standard English will survive for international       communication. However, it is impossible for one language to totally control the world. Already, other languages are fighting back against the control of English on the net. Governments around the world are also starting to protect smaller languages and recognize the importance of keeping a variety of cultures and languages. English will probably stay in control for a long time, but it certainly won't become the only language in the world.", "id": "high10788.txt"}
