But when a student scores poorly on a test, how does he or she benefit? The student loses confidence and ends up feeling \"stupid\". I believe we can use tests to improve learning, not just check what our students have memorized. \nI recently attended a conference where the speaker, Thomas Guskey, challenged us to consider how we might change the culture of classroom testing. Guskey asked, \"What happens to these tests? What educational purpose do they serve?\" His point was that teachers typically grade test papers, give them back, and then move on. Students put their test papers away and never look at them again. Some students will even make a show of walking leisurely to the trash to crumple and toss their test papers into the bin. If a student feels like he or she studied hard for a test and still got a bad grade, he or she can become disheartened with the classroom cycle that consists of teaching and testing, teaching and testing. \nMany times, testing simply feels like a winning or losing game between students and their teachers. I'll never forget the day my son and I were discussing testing in one of his least favorite classes (and with his least favorite teacher) and he looked me square in the eyes and said, \"Mom, I refuse to play the game.\" My son was in honors classes, yet he felt this way! Would it be regarded as less of a game if students had a chance to retake the test, or work out where they'd gone wrong?\nThere is an argument for the exam as the final assessment: if students don't have the knowledge by the time they're tested, that's unfortunate, but it's time to move on -- there's only so much time to teach the material. \"What about surgeons  ? Do they 'test' their learning on a genuine patient?\" Guskey asked. \"Or do they get to check their learning on a dead body to make sure they've got it worked out?\" You wouldn't show a surgeon a heart bypass in a textbook and then send him or her straight into the operating room!\nBy moving on immediately after giving an exam, we're missing a valuable opportunity to teach our students exactly what they need to learn! Rather than a game in which students either win or lose, we can turn testing into a win-win classroom experience by giving students the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. We can change the culture in our classrooms by using tests as a tool to improve learning rather than marking the end of the learning process.", "id": "high20135.txt"}
