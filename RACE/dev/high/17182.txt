Or prepared yourself for the crowdedness he warned about only to zip right through?\n     A large number of private companies say they have the one thing that can ease such frustrations: better information.\n     Now one of those companies, SpeedInfo Inc., has fixed 50 solar--powered, wireless radar sensors along main roads in theprefix = st1 /District of Columbiathat take readings of average traffic speeds twice a minute in both directions.\n     The company says the sensors provide a far more accurate picture of road conditions than can be collected from helicopters or highway patrol alerts.\n     In a business model that SpeedInfo hopes will develope around the country, the San Jose, California--based company is letting the city use the data for traffic planning free of charge, in exchange for access to the side of the road. Speedlnfo plans to sell the information to paying customers, including broadcasters and companies that provide information for in--car navigation equipment.\nThe problem with traditional traffic reports is that in most of the country, they rely on highway patrol accident reports that come 30 to 40 minutes late and a few helicopters that get into the sky during rush hour, SpeedInfo Chief Executive Doug Finlay said.\n      \"Chopper Bill gets in the sky and says, 'Oh, I'm looking at the road and the cars are going slow, \"' Finlay said. \"Chopper Bill is the best data you got.\"\n     Tim Lomax, a researcher at the Texas Transportation Institute, said a recent increase of high--tech traffic data systems is good for drivers.\n      \"Even if it doesn't get rid of traffic crowdedness, they at least give people an idea of what sort of choices they're facing and more control over their destiny, which is part of the frustrating element of traffic crowdedness,\" Lomax said.", "id": "high17182.txt"}
