Gravity has never been done before.12 Years a Slave I watched once and will never watch again.I watched Gravity 5 times and still love it.''Dominionator\n\"This movie was realistic and engaging at every second.Even the dramatic pauses were worthwhile and definitely not a waste of time.The script inferred and hinted at events rather than just plain saying them,and that was genius.Outstanding photography,amazing special effects and the acting is top notch.There were a few people that walked out during some scenes.What a shame!\" Apols", "id": "high6326.txt"}
