The iron can clean itself, inside where irons get dirty. Because it cleans itself each and every time you empty it.\nHow? With a push of a magic blue button.\nThe magic blue button\nThe first thing you'll notice that's different about this iron is the blue button on the side. It's marked \"Self Clean\". Push this blue button, and you can wash out loose mineral deposits that remain and block up inside. Push this button, and you've made life a lot easier.\nLess chance of brown spots\nSure, Self Cleaning Iron is going to cut down on brown spots. (Those ugly spots that happen on nice, cleanly pressed clothes.) Because a Self Cleaning Iron becomes clean each time you press that magic blue button.\nSteams much longer\nCommon sense tells you that if you've an iron that blocks less often it has to stay younger for a long period of time. In other words, it steams much longer. That's another joy of owning General Electric's Self Cleaning Iron.\nWhat does it mean to you\nToday you are doing so much more than just running a house and running after the kids.\nYou're working. You're going to school. It's all part of your lifestyle. The iron can change that lifestyle. By giving you less trouble before you iron. If we can make it easier for you to be a better wife, a better mother, a better housemaker, we want to. The new Self Cleaning Iron is another one of Home-Makers from General Electric.\nLifestyle.\nWe're with yours.\nGENERAL ELECTRIC", "id": "high763.txt"}
