But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.\"\n--Albert Einstein\nIf you have a kid with special needs in the school system, chances are you have come across that saying hanging on a classroom wall. My five-year-old daughter Syona has cerebral palsy (a medical condition affecting someone's control over their movement ) and it means, combined with her communication challenges and sight problems, that standard assessments (and by \"standard\", I mean the ones used to assess kids with special needs ) aren't always an accurate measure of her abilities.\nBy now you have probably heard about Chris Ulmer, the 26-year-old teacher in Jacksonville, Florida, who starts his special education class by calling up each student individually to give them much admiration and a high-five (a gesture of greeting or congratulation). I couldn't help but be reminded of Syona's teacher and how she supports each kid in a very similar way. Ulmer recently shared a video of his teaching experience. \"I have seen their confidence and self-worth increase rapidly, \" he said. All I could think was: How lucky these students are to have such inspirational teachers.\nSyona's teacher has an attitude that can best be summarized in one word: awesome. Her teacher doesn't focus on what can't be done--she focuses on what can be done. Over the past several months, my husband Dilip and I have seen Syona's confidence increase tenfold. She uses words she wouldn't have thought of using before. She recently told me about her classmate's trip to Ecuador and was very proud when I understood her on the first try.\nI actually wonder what the influence would be if we did something similar to what Ulmer does with his students in our home. We've recently started our day by reminding each other of the good qualities we all possess. If we are reminded of our strengths on a regular basis, we will become increasingly confident about progress and success.\nUlmer's reach as a teacher goes far beyond the walls of his classroom. In fact, he teaches all of us to take a moment and truly appreciate the strengths of an important person in our lives.", "id": "high14518.txt"}
