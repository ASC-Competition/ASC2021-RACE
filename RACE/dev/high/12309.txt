The bite of the mosquito can be deadly. The insects carry serious diseases like malaria  . It is estimated that almost 630,000 people died from malaria and malariarelated causes in 2012, and most of these cases were in African countries.\nIn the United States, a group of California scientists are working to develop a more effective and less costly substance   to protect people from mosquitoes. The researchers are investigating the sense of smell in mosquitoes. They found the insects use the same _ for identifying carbon dioxide in human breath as they do for the smell of our skin. Anandasankar Ray, who is leading the investigation, says scientists tested more than a million chemical compounds   until they found a substance called Ethyl Pyruvate. He says Ethyl Pyruvate makes the mosquitoes' receptors inactive. \"When we apply Ethyl Pyruvate to a human arm and offer it to hungry mosquitoes in a cage, very few of the mosquitoes are attracted to the human arm because only a few of them are able to smell it out,\" said Ray.\nGenevieve Tauxe, a member of the research team, says it was not easy to find the neurons   of noble cells that recognize both the smell of human breath and skin. \"With the device used to examine the mosquito, we are able to insert a very small electrode   into the part of the mosquito's nose, where its smelling neurons are and where the smell is happening,\" said Tauxe.\nAnandasankar Ray says a product based on Ethyl Pyruvate may cost less to produce than DEFT, the most effective chemical treatment now in use. He says DEFT is too costly for most people who live in areas affected by malaria.\n\"Perhaps by finding smells that can attack other target receptors, we will be able to improve upon DEFT and finally have the next generation of insect behaviour control products,\" said Ray.", "id": "high12309.txt"}
