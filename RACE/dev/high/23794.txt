That's because 2007 marks the beginning of the International Polar Year (IPY), a two-year-old activity of science projects that aim to show how important the poles are to the health of our planet. During the IPY, which will last until March 2009, thousands of researchers from more than 60 countries will conduct more than 200 projects and expeditions  to both the top and bottom of the world.\nIn recent years, the polar regions have begun to change severely as a result of global warming. Temperatures there are rising faster than anywhere else on Earth. As a result, the ice and snow in these regions are melting  at record-setting rates. One result is that sea levels are rising around the world, putting animals and people at risk.\nOnly by studying the poles, say IPY researchers, can we find ways to protect them and ourselves.\nBoth the Arctic and the Antarctic are cold and remote, but the two regions have important differences. For one thing, the Arctic is an ice-covered ocean surrounded by land. The Antarctic, on the other hand, is a continent of ice-covered land surrounded by water.\nMost polar studies have focused on the Arctic, and that is where scientists have observed the most remarkable changes in the ice. During a typical year, Arctic ice expands  in the winter and shrinks  in the summer. But recently, the amount of ice covering the ocean has been steadily dropping in both seasons.", "id": "high23794.txt"}
