However, it may soon be replaced. The new development- liquid wood- can replace plastics in all branches of modern-day industries.\nPlastic as a material enjoys the biggest demand in the modern world, but it does have a number of drawbacks. First and foremost, plastic isn't recyclable. Secondly, it contains toxins   helping develop cancerous diseases. Finally, it's made of oil and oil reserves aren't endless.\nThe liquid wood technology is likely to replace plastic and providing mankind with new materials for many years ahead. Norbert Eisenfreich, a senior researcher at the Faunhofer Institute for Chemical Technology in Germany (ICT), said that arboform, the new material, is made of lignin , which can be obtained from soft tissues of wood. Once mixed with several other matenals, it turns into solid and non-toxic _ for plastics.\nICT team leader Emilia Regina Inone-Kauffmann said the wood-working industry separates wood into three basic components, including lignin. Lignin isn't used for the production of paper. Specialists of ICT mixed lignin with several natural materials and thus invented the material which could be melted and molded  .\nWhen solid, arboform looks like plastic and possesses tho qualitie of polished wood. It can be used for the production of any items. Arboform is already used for the production of car parts which require extra strength. In addition, liquid wood can be recycled repeatedly. The material preserved all of its qualities even if it's reprocessed ten times.\nHowever, the new invention doesn't enjoy an extensive use due to the high content of sulfur  in it. German researchers are sure to reduce the amount of sulfur by 90% very soon to make arboform usable for home needs.", "id": "high9272.txt"}
