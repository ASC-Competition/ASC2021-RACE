I stood in front of nearly 200 financial planners and I talked to them about why financial blogs are a good thing.\nI'm a confident writer. I've been doing this long enough that I know my strength and my limitations. I'm less confident as a speaker. I don't have time to pause to collect my thoughts. I'm not able to edit. I'm afraid of being trapped in a corner without being able to talk my way out. Basically, I'm scared to speak.\nIt would be easy to simply refuse the chances that come my way. When somebody asks me to speak in front of a group, I could say \"no\". When radio and television stations call for an interview, I could say \"no\". But for the past two years, I've been following _ to say \"yes\" to new chances.\nTo say \"yes\" is to live in fear. My goal is to continually improve myself to become better than I am today. One way to do that is to do the things that scare me, to take them on as challenges, and to learn from them -- even if I fail.\nIn mid-November, a local station asked me to appear on live television. \"I realize it's short notice,\" the producer wrote, \"but we'd love to have you on the show if you're available tonight.\" I was frightened. I thought about recent taped television interviews that I had hated. I was afraid of what might happen.\nBut I also thought about the things that had gone right. I thought of how my speaking skills had improved over the past year. And then I thought of the book I was reading, a book that I had bought for $1.29 at the local store. The Magic of Thinking Big was a huge bestseller during the 1960s. Written by Dr. David Schwartz, a professor at Georgia State University, the book contains dozens of practical tips on how to take risks to achieve big goals. Schwartz argues that nobody will believe in you until you believe in yourself.\nSo when the television producer asked if I wanted to appear on his show, I thought big. \"Sure,\" I said. \"I'll do it.\" I acted confidently, but on the inside I was frightened. What I needed was techniques to build up my confidence and to overcome my fear.", "id": "high8422.txt"}
