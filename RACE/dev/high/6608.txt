The two thought of the idea while discussing recent years' school picnics.\"The picnic is one of the biggest events of the year,but it has become a bit _ ,\"said Ms.Cho.\"The activities are the same every year .We thought that a performance by a student band would make the school picnic more interesting and fun.\"\nMr.Lopez,Ms.Cho,and three other teachers judged the contest,which took place in the gym. To see if the bands could present a wide range of musical skills,the teachers asked them each to prepare two songs:one song with original words,and another in which students played instrumental music only.The judges finally chose the band Four Square as the winner of the contest.Four Square is a rock band with an unusual twist:it includes a violin player! The members of Four Square write their own songs and practice three times a week after schoo1.\nStudents and teachers agreed that the band competition was:a big success.All are looking forward to the school picnic in June.", "id": "high6608.txt"}
