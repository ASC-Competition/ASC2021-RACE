Our own planet, Earth, is becoming more and more crowed and polluted. Luckily, we can start again and build a better world on Mars. Here is what life could be like.\nFirst of all, transport should be much better. At present, our spaceships are too slow to carry large numbers of people to Mars -- it takes months. However, by 2100, spaceship can travel at half the speed of light. It might take us two or three days to get to Mars!\nSecondly, humans need food, water and air to live. Scientists should be able to develop plants that can be grown on Mars. These plants will produce the food and air that we need. However, can these plants produce water for us ? There is no answer now.\nThere is a problem for us to live on Mars. Mars pulls us much less than the Earth does. This will be dangerous because we could easily jump too high and fly slowly away into space. To prevent this, humans on Mars have to wear special shoes to make themselves heavier.\nLife on Mars will be better than that on Earth in many ways, People will have more space. Living in a large building with only 10 bedrooms is highly possible. Many people believe that robot will do most of our work, so we have more time for our hobbies.\nThere will probably be no school on Mars. Every student will have a computer at home which is connected to the internet. They can study, do their homework and take exams in online schools. Each student will also have their own online teacher called \"e-teacher\".\nHowever, in some ways, life on Mars may not be better than that on the earth today. Food will not be the same -- meals will probably be in the form of pills and will not be as delicious as they are today, Also, space travel will make many people feel ill. The spaceship will travel fast but the journey to Mars will probably be very uncomfortable.", "id": "high21603.txt"}
