Those results could be improper because the studies involved older people, and women live longer than men: The men tested are the survivors, \"so they're the ones that may not have shown such cognitive(;) decline,\" said study team leader Elizabeth of the University of Warwick in England.\nPeople surveyed completed four tasks that tested sex-related cognitive skills: matching an object to its rotated  form, matching lines shown from the same angle, typing as many words in a particular category   as possible in the given time, e.g.  \"object usually colored gray\", and recalling the location of objects in a line drawing. The first two were tasks at which men usually excel; the latter are typically dominated  by women.\nWithin each age group studied, men and women performed better in their separate categories on average. And though performance declined with age for both genders , women showed obviously less decline than men overall .", "id": "high7491.txt"}
