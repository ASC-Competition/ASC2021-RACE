By using Everyclick.com, which is being added to a number of university computers across the UK, students can raise money every time they search, but it won't cost them a penny.\nResearch shows that students are extremely passionate about supporting charity -- 88% of full time students have used the Internet to give to charity. This figure is high considering this age group is often the least likely to have their own income. 19% of 22 to 24 year olds have short-term debts of more than PS5,000. With rising personal debt levels in this age group, due to university tuition fees or personal loans and a lack of long-term savings, traditional methods of donating to charity are often not appealing or possible.\nBeth Truman, a 21 year old recent university graduate, has used everyclick.com to donate to her chosen charity, the RSPCA, for two years and has seen the \"wugging\" grow in popularity with students. \"When you're at university you become more socially aware, but it's sometimes hard to give to others when you have little money yourself,\" says Beth. \"Wugging is great for people in this age group as it allows them to use the technology on a daily basis to give to charity, without costing them a single penny.\"\nWugging is perfect for people who want to be more socially aware and supportive but don't feel they have the means to do so. Students using the web can raise money for causes they care about without costing them anything in terms of time or money, and charities get a valuable source of funding.\nEveryclick.com works like any other search engine, allowing users to search for information, news and images but users can decide which of the UK's 170,000 charities they would like to support through their clicks. Everyclick.com then makes monthly payments to every registered charity. Launched in June 2005, Everyclick.com is now the eighth largest search engine and one of the busiest charity websites in the UK.", "id": "high4613.txt"}
