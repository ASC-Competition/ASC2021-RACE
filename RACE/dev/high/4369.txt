The basic rate is 28 Yuan ($4.22) per person, plus an additional 4 Yuan an hour. The hotel also offers a package of 68 Yuan for 10 hours and 88 Yuan for 24 hours.\nAll of the capsules are imported from Japan where capsule hotels originated,and each is equipped with independent sockets, clocks, lights, TV and wireless Internet service. The hotel also has a public lavatory ,shower room, smoking room and shared guest room.\n\"This is a huge bargain compared with other budget hotels in Shanghai,\" said Ta Zan, the owner of the hotel. Ta used to stay at capsule hotels in Tokyo during his undergraduate years and worked at a capsule hotel while he was doing his MBA in Japan in 2005, so he knows how they work and how to make guests feel comfortable.\nHe based the hotel on capsule hotels in Japan but he has made some special changes based on Chinese guests' habits. \"In Japan capsule hotels are usually equipped with bathtubs, but in China people are more willing to take a shower, so we have the shower room,\" he said. He has also separated the capsules into three snoring   zones so that guests who often snore won't disturb others. Like most of capsule hotels in Japan, the one in Shanghai is for men only.\nBut the idea of staying in such a _ space is not appealing to everyone. \"I feel the idea is like putting a person in a coffin  , and the price is also not that appealing. A bed at a youth hostel in Shanghai costs about 60 Yuan per night,\" said Wang Lei, a student from Beijing.", "id": "high4369.txt"}
