My hero is younger than me, but we are related. His name is Marcus. He is my cousin. He isn't necessarily a wise person or someone who does something great every day, but he has taught me to appreciate some of the simple things in life.\nI am now in 11th grade. When I was in 8th grade, Marcus had a brain tumor   which had to be removed. Thankfully the tumor was benign  . When the doctors removed it, Marcus lost his sight. He felt down only once. Ever since then, he has been an extremely happy second-grader. He is very typical of a nine-year-old. He likes to tell jokes, play new games, and he likes to play tricks on people, just like children at his age. I love spending time with him. We go to movies whenever there is a good one and look after him every chance I get.\nI say that Marcus helps to appreciate the simple thing in life. He doesn't have his sight and that causes me to realize how lucky I am to be able to see, to walk, and to talk. I can do everything I need to. If everyone could see how happy and satisfied Marcus is and how much he makes everyone around him happy, then they might just be able to better appreciate the simple things in life.", "id": "high17764.txt"}
