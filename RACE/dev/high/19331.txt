If you answered yes to more than one of these questions,you just might be an ecotourist.\nEcotourists are people who want to experience the unspoiled natural world--and leave it that way when they return home. This trend started in the 1990s,and ecotourism is now growing three times faster than the entire tourism industry . The Kapawi Ecolodge in Ecuador's remote Amazon Basin is contributing to that expansion,and it gives a snapshot of what ecotourism looks like.\nAt the Ecolodge,a small group of cabins sits in the middle of the Achuar people's reserve and is only accessible by air. From here,visitors can explore parts of the Amazon rainforest seen by few outsiders. As they do,local Achuar guides explain how the forest is like their supermarket,where they find food,clothing,medicine and tools. As a result,tourists learn to appreciate the local culture as well as the natural environment.\nThe owners of Kapawi pay monthly rent to the Achuar people,but they also train the community to run and manage the lodge. They have agreed on a plan to turn the operation over to the Achuar completely by 2011.The owners are working to make ecotourism benefit and empower the local people.\nYou probably won't start your own ecolodge,but you can be an ecotourist if you follow these guidelines:Protect the environment;Support local businesses;Respect the local customs and traditions.\nThe world is full of fascinating places to visit. As an ecotourist,you can enjoy them yourself and make sure that they remain beautiful for future generations as well.", "id": "high19331.txt"}
