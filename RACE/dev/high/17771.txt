More than 9, 000 representatives gathered for a United Nations conference on climate change. Organizers called the meeting to work toward a treaty to fight rising temperatures on our planet. The treaty would be signed in 2015 and take effect after 2020.\n    In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is leading government efforts to fight climate change. The agency just ended a series of public hearings across the country. The EPA was seeking comments as it considers tightening clean air rules for coal burning power plants.\n    David Doniger is a climate policy expert. He says it is the duty of the EPA to control carbon as a pollutant. He wants the agency to establish new rules that would move the United States toward a cleaner energy environment.\n     \"No one is coming up with standards that would knock out all those power plants. We're   talking about a shift from the dirtier ones to the cleaner ones, and from all those fossil fuel- powered ones towards renewable and even nuclear sources of energy. \"\n    He says the government is responsible for protecting clean air ,not protecting old and dirty  power stations. He says, \"That's the only way that we can continue to have the way of life we want without running into the wall on climate change impacts, which in turn will destroy the quality of life we have.\"\n    The EPA is now considering comments from the nationwide hearings. The agency plans to announce proposed rule changes in June.", "id": "high17771.txt"}
