Here are some of them that you see on the roads.\nNumber one is a sign with the number thirty on it. When drivers see this sign, they must not go at more than thirty kilometres an hour. We see this sign when we are getting near a town.\nNumber two is a sign that we're near a crossing. We must drive carefully.\nNumber three is a sign that there is a bend in the road. Again, we must drive slowly and carefully. It is not safe to go round a bend very fast.\nNumber four is a sign that there is another road coming in from the right. There is a junction  at this place.\nNumber five is a sign that there is a hill and number six is a sign that the road gets narrow. Drivers must go slowly and carefully.\nNumber seven has the word \"SCHOOL\" on it. This is a sign that there is a school at the side of the street or the road. Perhaps there are children going to or leaving school. So drivers must look carefully and go slowly.\nNumber eight is a sign with the letter \"P\" on it. The letter \"P\"means \"Parking\". At some places, there are the signs \"No parking\" or \"No waiting\". If a driver leaves his car near one of these signs, a policeman may come and write down the number of his car.", "id": "high16636.txt"}
