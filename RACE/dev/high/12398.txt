H.E. is going to sing at the CCTV annual Spring Festival Evening Party, is that true?\" cried out Peng Weiye, a Senior 2 girl in Shanghai and die-hard S. H.E. fan.\nAfter checking it on the Internet, Peng quickly phoned friends to spread the news. For fans like her, S. H. E. 's performance is perhaps the only part of the old fashioned evening to get excited about.\nThe Taiwanese band is made up of Selina, Hebe and Ella. Their name comes from the first letter of each of the singers' English names.\nLast week S. H. E. announced they would perform in Las Vegas, US, over Christmas and then in Guangzhou on January 15.\nAt their Shanghai show on October 30, hundreds of parents waited outside the Hongkou Stadium. Inside, thousands of teenagers sang, cried and shouted as the band performed.\n\"I love their music, healthy image and everything related to them. Thank God that, although my parents don't understand why I love them so much, they still bought me a ticket for that show,\" said Peng about the Shanghai performance.\nIt is not just on the mainland that the three girls have made audiences much excited. In the past year the band has passed through Taiwan, Hong Kong and even Singapore and Malaysia.\nWhen the three high school girls entered a singing contest in Taiwan in 2000, none of them ever dreamed of being a superstar. \"We had never met before, and we didn't talk at all at the beginning,\" recalled Ella.\nWhen asked about the secret of their success, she said, \"Our average looks and not-so-expensive clothes keep us close to our fans. We are happy to be the girls next door, your singing sisters.\"\n\"It's really a magical journey, from day-dreaming high school girls to singers performing on the same stage as our idols . Nothing but magical,\" she said.", "id": "high12398.txt"}
