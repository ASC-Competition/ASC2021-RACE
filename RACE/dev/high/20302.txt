In countries where status is important, it is not advisable to invite people of different statuses to the same dinner party. Americans will often invite people to their homes. However, in some societies the home is considered too personal, unworthy, or too small to serve as a proper place for business entertaining. In some countries there is a \"help yourself\" method of entertaining done in the home. This method does not work well when entertaining people whose culture teaches them to wait to be asked three times before accepting an offer of food. For example, a Chinese guest went hungry all the evening without eating though he was quite hungry because he was too shy to take food after only being asked to do so once. In another case, an American woman executive  was being entertained in London. After having the tea served, the American woman helped herself to cream and sugar rather than waiting to be served. The English hostess was upset by the thought that she was not serving quickly enough.\nAs a general rule, a small gift from your home country is OK. A gift that is tied to the particular interest of the person is especially good. Gifts for children are also well received. Be careful that the \"hometown\" gift you are bringing to Singapore is not made in Hong Kong. Because many gifts carry symbolic meanings, it is always best to seek the advice of a cultural information before selecting gifts. The giving of large gifts, or payments for special service, should only be carried out after talking with legal department in the home and host culture.", "id": "high20302.txt"}
