Blame! Blame!\nIt seems natural to sing this self-pitying song,but the truth is,if you don't like your life,you should do something about it.No one else knows exactly how you feel or what you need.No one can read your mind correctly.You are the only one with the power to cheek your life,and if you want it to be different,you can change what you're doing.\nWhen you're in trouble,don't give away your power to decide how you feel about yourself. Choose how you want to think and act.Other people can't make you unhappy or angry.They only act in their own way and then it's up to you to decide how you will respond .For example,your friends go out to lunch without you and you feel very angry.How are you going to act? You may blame your friends,\"They are not kind.Who needs them anyway?\" Or you may tell your friends how you feel,listen to their explanation,and let them know you'd like to be invited next time.\nWhen you decide everything in your own way,you're getting hold of your own life and shaping it according to your tastes and feelings.You can choose to be happy,to make friends and to build an interesting life.When you blame others for what is or isn't happening in your life,you have stopped growing or learning.\nOne of the most important rules is that you can never change another person by your direct action.The only person you have the right to change is yourself.Once you change,the other person has something different to respond to and change is possible.If you want change in your life,begin with yourself.", "id": "high3527.txt"}
