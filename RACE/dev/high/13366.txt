What we must remember, however, is not merely how powerful character is in influencing our fate  , but how powerful we are in shaping our own character and, therefore, our own fate. Character may determine our fate, but character is not determined by fate.\nIt's a common mistake to think of character as something that is fully formed and fixed very early in life. It calls to mind old proverbs like \"A leopard can't change its spots\" and \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks.\"\nThis perspective that our character is \"etched in stone\" is supported by a great deal of modern psychology emphasizing self-acceptance. As Popeye says, \"I am what I am.\" The hidden message is:Don't expect me to be more, better, or different.\nUltimately, these views of humanity totally undervalue the lifelong potential for growth that comes with the power of reflection and choice.\nHow depressing it would be to believe that we can't choose to be better, more honest, more respectful, more responsible, and more caring. None of us should give up the personal seeking to improve our character. Not because we're bad, we don't have to be sick to get better , but because we're not as good as we could be.\nThere are so many things in life we can't control, whether we're beautiful or smart, whether we had good parents or bad, whether we grew up with affirmation or negation. It's inspiring to remember that nothing but moral will power is needed to make us better.\nNo, it isn't easy. But if we make a great effort to become more aware of the habits of heart and mind that drive our behavior, we can begin to place new emphasis on our higher values so that we become what we want our children to think we are.", "id": "high13366.txt"}
