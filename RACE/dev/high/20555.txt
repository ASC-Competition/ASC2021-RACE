Probably so.\n\"On the contrary.\" says L. Giambra. an expert in psychology  .\"Daydreaming is quite necessary. Without it, the mind couldn't get done all the thinking it has to do during a normal day. You can't possibly do all your thinking with a consciousness  . Instead, your unconscious mind is working out problems all the time. Daydreaming then may be one way that the unconscious and conscious states of mind have silent dialogues.\"\nEarly psychology experts paid no attention to the importance of daydreams or even considered them harmful. In the past daydreaming was thought to be a cause of some mental illnesses. They did not have a better understanding of daydreams until the late 1980's. Eric Klinger, a professor of psychology, is the writer of the book DAYDREAMING. Klinger says. \"We know now that daydreaming is one of the main ways that we organize our lives, learn from our experiences, and plan for our futures... Daydreams really are a window on the things we fear and the things we long for in life.\"\nDaydreams are usually very simple and direct, quite unlike sleep dreams, which may be hard to understand. It's easier to gain a deep understanding of your life by paying close attention to your daydreams than by trying to examine your sleep dreams carefully. Daydreams help you recognize the difficult situations in our life and find out a possible way of dealing with them.\nDaydreams cannot be predicted. They move off in unexpected directions which may be creative and full of ideas. For many famous artists and scientists, daydreams were and are a main source of creative energy.", "id": "high20555.txt"}
