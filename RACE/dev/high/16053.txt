One California city closed off its downtown due to unstable buildings.\nThe 7.2-magnitude quake centered just south of the US border near Mexicali was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the region in decades.\n\"It sounds like it's felt by at least 20 million people,\" USGS seismologist Lucy Jones said. \"Most of Southern California felt this earthquake.\"\nSunday afternoon's earthquake hit hardest in Mexicali, a commerce center along Mexico's border with California, where authorities said the quake was followed by at least 20 smaller aftershocks, including ones of magnitudes 5.1, 4.5 and 4.3.\n\"It has not stopped trembling in Mexicali,\" said Baja California state Civil Protection Director Alfredo Escobedo on Monday.\nEscobedo said one man was killed when his home collapsed just outside of Mexicali and another died when he rushed into the street in panic and was struck by a car. At least 100 people were injured in the city, most of them struck by falling objects. Power was out in virtually the entire city.\nSusan Warmbier was putting away groceries in the San Diego suburb of Chula Vista when her husband asked, \"Is the house moving?\"\nElsewhere in San Diego, there were reports of shattered windows, broken pipes and water main breaks in private buildings, but no reports of injuries, San Diego Fire-Rescue Department spokesman Maurice Luque said. Coronado Bridge over San Diego Bay was briefly closed as a precaution.\nAcross the border in Tijuana, Mexico, the quake caused buildings to sway and knocked out power in some areas.
