Below we have put together a short list of our favourite summer break locations  that offer a great balance of culture, sunshine and fun.\nBerlin, the second most populous city in the European Union, gets the third place on our list. It has three famous airports: Tegel International Airport, Tempelhof International Airport, and Schonefeld International Airport.\nThe capital of Germany is on this list not only because it is a fantastic place to go on holiday but also since it teaches a very important lesson to humanity(,). The Berlin Wall, the better part of which still remains well kept for educational and amusement  aims, reminds us of the extra costs paid by everyone. Today, the undamaged part of the Wall, known as the East Side Gallery, shows striking murals ;if you are interested in this chapter  of the city's history, there is also a Berlin Wall Memorial you would want to visit. The Potsdamer Platz, divided into two by the Wall, is a newly developed area that is famous for a large shopping center and movie theatre complexes , and adds a bit of modern colour to Berlin's historical value.\nMuch like the other places that made the list, Berlin is also a city of art. The city has over one hundred and fifty museums in all, and a few of the ones providing an extraordinary experience include the Art Center Berlin Friedrichstrabe, the Museum of Indian Art, and the Museum of East Asian Art. Appreciating Berlin's art is much like taking a university course in itself and it can only be truly appreciated in several trips.", "id": "high1090.txt"}
