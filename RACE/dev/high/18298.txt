She ran across the picturesque campus to the shores of Cayuga Lake, where she jumped into the water. \nSo did many of her fellow seniors. But dozens of students decided to stay away, especially the  ly few newly arrived male students. \nWells College, which since 1868 had educated only women, began accepting men this year in hopes of supporting its decreasing enrollment. \nFor many students and alumnae, it was a crushing decision. After the college announced last October that it would go co-educational, about half of the students protested and two filed a lawsuit, which they later dropped. \nThe students--33 men and 383 women--came to campus late last month. Both sexes are now trying to navigate the new social landscape. Mr. Phillips said \"You can't do guy stuff. Every time you want to sit and watch sports or a game, it turns into a movie.\" \nThe women were \"somewhat nasty.\" \"I could see the dirty looks in their eyes,\" he said. \"But I was not going to let that stop me from coming.\"\nWells was a place where women did not have to fuss over their appearance or fight to be taken seriously by their professors. They could enjoy the friendship of their campus sisters and their playful traditions. Besides jumping into the lake, the women dance around the maypole each May and kiss the feet of the statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, before exams. \nMs. Alexander said, \"People told us we wouldn't notice a difference, but from the moment men arrived on campus you could notice a difference. Women are waking up early to put on makeup, and that's odd,\" she said. \nHenry Wells, a founder of Wells Fargo and a friend of Cornell's donator, Ezra Cornell established this college, when women were not considered capable of higher learning. \"Give her the opportunity,\" he wrote.\nThe news that the college would go coed created ripples far beyond campus. One alumna wrote a letter to the college's president, Lisa Marsh Ryerson, saying the founder would haunt her. \"I believe Henry Wells would have haunted me if I let Wells College close,\" said Ms. Marsh Ryerson, a Wells alumna herself. \nThe great-great-great-great granddaughter of Henry Wells, Stephanie Redmond, 18, of Washington State, said that earlier this year a Wells student had tracked her down and asked her to support the protest. But Ms. Redmond said the move to admit men had encouraged her to enroll at Wells this year as a freshman. She plans on a career in engineering, a male-dominated field, and said attending an all-women's college might have put her at a disadvantage.", "id": "high18298.txt"}
