I've loved and hated my job, which can be exciting and stressful . Holidays are the hardest. I don't think I could count the number of times I've been asked to work a holiday for another, because \"You don't have a family.\"\nThis is what I faced the year that I received my most beloved Christmas gift.\nI was to work the night shift on Christmas Eve, 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. It was a bitterly cold night when I arrived at work. When I stepped onto my floor, I sensed excitement. As I rounded the corner, I saw all of my co-workers waiting for me with big smiles. I thought that something big was up, and they were waiting for me to be part of it. Just then one of my co-workers Susan stepped forward, and I realized I was not just part of it...  _ !\nHappy tears filled my eyes as Susan told me she'd celebrated an early Christmas Eve with her daughter so that I could have the shift off and go home to be with my parents. Maggie had taken Susan's shift, and two more had split Maggie's shift.\nGrateful tears froze to my cheek as I reached my car. There was hardly any traffic as I sped home. I sang along to the carols on the radio, alone on the highway. But I was not alone in my heart, for it was filled with thanks and wonder.\nMy co-workers had given me the greatest Christmas gift I'd ever received--their friendship and understanding. Because of that gift, and the sweet memories of that night, I will never be alone on Christmas again.", "id": "high23388.txt"}
