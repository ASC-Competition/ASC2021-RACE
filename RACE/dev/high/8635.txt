I saw many of our nation's treasures, and I also saw a lot of unfortunate people like beggars and homeless folks in the streets.\nStanding outside the Ronald Reagan Center, I heard a voice say, \"Can you help me?\" When I turned around, I saw an elderly blind woman with her hand extended . In a natural reaction, I reached into my pocket, pulled out all of my loose change and placed it in her hand. I didn't even look at her. I was annoyed at being bothered by a beggar.\nBut the blind woman smiled and said, \"I don't want your money. I just need help finding the post office.\"\nImmediately, I realized what I had done. I acted with prejudice --I judged another person simply for what I thought she was.\nThe thing I had forgotten about myself is that I am an immigrant. I left Honduras and arrived in America at the age of 15. Through the years, I have been a dishwasher, cashier, mechanic and pizza delivery driver among many other jobs, and finally I became a network engineer.\nIn my own life, I have experienced many open acts of prejudice. I remember a time, at age 17-- I was a busboy, and I heard a father tell his little boy that if he did not do well at school, he would end up like me.\nBut now, living in my American middle-class lifestyle, it is too easy to forget my past, to forget who I am and where I have been, and to lose sight of where I want to be going. That blind woman on the street of Washington D.C. cured me of my blindness. She reminded me to always keep my eyes and heart open.", "id": "high8635.txt"}
