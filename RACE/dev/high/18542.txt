Since the 1930s, hundereds of stone balls have been found. They range in size from a few centimetres to over two metres. Who made these perfect spheres   and how they made them remains a mystery. Some researchers believe the stones were made by extreme heating followed by cooling. People could have  _ the spheres with sand or leather. The ancient Costa Ricans had no written language so there is no written record of just how they made the spheres, Almost all are made of granite  , a hard stone created by volcanoes. The granite quarries   were 25 to 30 miles away from the largest stones, which weigh more than 10 tons each. Nobody knows how people moved them. Many of the stones have been found near the remains of houses or graves. Some believed that the stones contained hidden treasures and a few have been smashed but nothing has been found inside. Despite these losses, the National Museum of Costa Rica has recorded 130 spheres. However, many stones are not included because they have been removed from their original sites and used as ornaments  in homes, gardens and churches. Clearly, there are also many stones that lie undiscovered.", "id": "high18542.txt"}
