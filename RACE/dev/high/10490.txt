Losing a job or a friend because of a poor attitude is unfortunate--especially because a bad attitude can be fixed.\nYou can find at least two ways to look at everything. A pessimist looks for difficulty in the opportunity, while an optimist looks for opportunity in the difficulty. A poet of long ago put the difference between optimism and pessimism  this way: two men looked out of the prison bars--one saw mud while the other saw stars.\nUnfortunately, many people look only at the problem and not at the opportunity that lies within the problem.
