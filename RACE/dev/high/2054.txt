Then he points to the phone and says, \"If there's anything else you need, just call.\" All this time you have been thinking one thing, \"How much should I tip  him?\" To make your next trip a little easier, here's a guide to tipping across some Asian countries.\nBangkok\nIn general, the more Westernized the place is, the more likely you will be expected to leave a tip. Some top-end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill. If not, waiters will appreciate you tacking on  the 10% yourself. However, if you're eating at a lower-end  restaurant a tip is not necessary. If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht , depending on how many bags you have. Taxis are now metered in Bangkok. Local custom is to round the fare  up to the nearest five baht.\nHong Kong\nTipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis . Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HK $100 in an especially nice restaurant. For HK $10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HK $20 bill may be more acceptable. When in a taxi, round up  to the nearest dollar.\nKuala Lumpur\nTipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive Westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room. If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants, there's no need to add a tip. At five-star hotels, one or two ringgit  will content a porter. At lower-end buildings don't feel you have to tip. Like Bangkok, many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit.\nSeoul\nTipping is not part of Korean culture, although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added. If you're at a Korean barbecue joint , there's no need to add anything extra. But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If you're at a top-end hotel, so expect to pay 500~1 000 won per bag. Taxi drivers don't accept a tip. Keep the change for yourself.", "id": "high2054.txt"}
