As they approach the last page, she reads, \"... and Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after.\" She closes the book and looks at the young girl, adding, \" You know, things don't always happen like this in real life, I just think you should know that now.\"\nWe were all raised on fairy tales with glass slippers, brave princes and magic! It didn't take too long to realize that stories like that aren't necessarily true. In real life, you learn that glass slippers are really uncomfortable, no prince is perfect and magic doesn't always work.\nSo what do you do when the way you planned things is not the way they turned out?\nKnow that parts of your fairy tale have already been written, and sadly, there's not much you can do about those first few chapters. You didn't get the best start. Your trust was unexpectedly betrayed  . You didn't get the job. Whatever falls and failures happened in your past, there's still more to the story.\nYour life has a lot of contributors  , and you are the editor-in-chief. You take what's there and create the masterpiece  . All the good pages and the bad can come together to make a beautiful adventure.\nWhen you find yourself wishing your life was more like the fairy tales, remember that in some ways it already is. There will be dragons, bad witches, great romances, winding roads and friends to help you along the way. Live your life carefully and positively as if you are writing a long story. Whether it's a comedy, tragedy or a little of both, the pen is in your hand. How it ends is all up to you.", "id": "high12282.txt"}
