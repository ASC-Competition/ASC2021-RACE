These days. Kids are first divided by age, then by achievement, and often by the type of performance.\nAmerican culture in general has increasingly accepted prizes and awards. The winner-take-all prize tradition that characterizes American culture started in the early 20th century along with the development of organized American sporting culture. In the second half of the 20th century, the attention on competition, and rankings  in general, grew rapidly. The 1970s had the most prize creations, including the addition of even more prizes to fields such as film and literature. Music competitions, including the introduction of the American Music Awards, saw similar growth in this time period. Since then, prizes have become increasingly fashionable, along with children's competitive activities. \nWhile awards may help people set goals and practice their activity, awards may also be a business practice. Trophies  help make sure that customers return year after year. Keeping kids, parents, teachers and coaches happy with lots of recognition keeps the money flowing to the organizers of the competitions.\nTrophies may keep kids coming back, and their parents paying, but research finds that giving kids trophies for doing an activity means lower levels of encouragement. High levels of encouragement are exactly what we want to foster   among kids to help them get long-term success and take pride in a well-earned achievement. So parents need to be careful when trying to get titles for their young kids, and make sure the honor created is for their kids and not for praise from anyone else in their children's lives.", "id": "high18939.txt"}
