Your mood may affect how you see the world around you, according to a new study. A team of researchers has proved that sadness could have an effect on the way we see colors.\nThe team, led by psychology researcher Christopher Thorstenson of the University of Rochester, found that people who had a sad mood were less accurate in identifying colors on the blue-yellow axis  , compared to people who weren't feeling sad.\n\"We were already deeply familiar with how often people use color terms to describe common phenomena, like mood, even when these concepts seem unrelated,\" Thorstenson said in a statement. \"We thought maybe a reason why these metaphors   appear was that there really was a connection between mood and identifying colors in a different way.\"\nThorstenson and his team are not the first to identify a link between a depressed mood and a difference in recognition. In 2010, Emanuel Bubl and his team at Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg in Germany first proved a link between mood and identifying colors. This was supported by a 2013 paper by Johnson Fam of the University of Singapore.\nThe team conducted two studies. In the first, 127 participants were chosen _ to watch one of two video clips, which had been proved in previous studies to feel either sadness or amusement. They didn't do that in a specific order. The entire group was then tasked with identifying the colors in 48 continued color changes. The group that had been shown the sad clip was measurably worse at identifying colors along the blue-yellow axis.\nFor the second study, 130 participants were randomly assigned to watch either a sad clip or a neutral   one. The sadness group showed reduced ability to identify colors along the blue-yellow axis than the neutral group.", "id": "high14500.txt"}
