Its citizens are fundamentally prosperous and the way of life in the major cities and towns is much the same however many miles divide them. _ However, there is some difference in lifestyle between city dwellers and the country people. Almost 90 per cent of the population lives in the fast-paced cities along the coast and has little more than a passing familiarity with the desert. The major cities preserve pockets of colonial heritage, but the overall impression is modern, with new buildings reflecting the country's youth. In contrast, the rural communities tend to be slow-moving and conservative. For many years, Australia was said to have \"ridden on the sheep's back\", a reference to wool being the country's main money earner. However, the wool industry is no longer dominant. Much of Australia's relatively sound economy is now achieved from natural coal and wheat, and by being the largest diamond producer in the world. Newer industries such as tourism and wine making are also increasingly important. Australians are generally friendly and relaxed, with a self-deprecating sense of humor. On the whole, Australia is a society without hierarchies  , an attitude generally held to stem from its prisoner beginnings.\nYet, contrary to widespread belief, very few Australians have true prisoner origins. Within only one generation of the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, Australia had become a nation of immigrants. Originally coming almost entirely from the British Isles, today one in three Australians comes from elsewhere. Australia's liberal postwar immigration policies led to an influx of survivors from war-torn Europe, most notably Greeks, Italians, Poles and Germans.\nThe emphasis has shifted in recent years and today the majority of new immigrants are from Southeast Asia. Today Australia is a 'blend of nations' and although some racism exists, _ has generally been a successful experiment and the country is justifiably proud to have one of the most harmonious multicultural communities in the world.", "id": "high952.txt"}
