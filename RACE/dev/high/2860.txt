At some point, however, we all begin to question our heroes and our need for them. This leads us to ask: What is a hero?\nDespite immense differences in cultures, heroes around the world generally share a number of characteristics that instruct and inspire people.\nA hero does something worth talking about. A hero has a story of adventure to tell and community who will listen. But a hero goes beyond mere fame.\nHeroes serve powers or principles larger than themselves. Like high-voltage transformers, heroes take the energy of higher powers and step it down so that it can be used by ordinary people.\nThe hero lives a life worthy of imitation. Those who imitate a genuine hero experience life with new depth, enthusiasm, and meaning. A sure test for would-be heroes is what or whom do they serve? What are they willing to live and die for? If the answer or evidence suggests they serve only their own fame, they may be famous persons but not heroes. Madonna and Michael Jackson are famous, but who would claim that their fans find life more abundant?\nHeroes are catalysts   for change. They have a vision from the mountaintop. They have the skill and the charm to move the masses. They create new possibilities. Without Gandhi, India might still be part of the British Empire. Without Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King, Jr., we might still have segregated   buses, restaurants, and parks. It may be possible for large-scale change to occur without leaders with magnetic personalities, but the pace of change would be slow, the vision uncertain, and the committee meetings endless.", "id": "high2860.txt"}
