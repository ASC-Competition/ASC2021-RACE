It is a fantastic 4D film to entertain you before your trip on the London Eye. The 4D effects are great.\nNo Extra Cost to You\nThat's right; you buy your ticket for the London Eye and 4D cinema experience. Merlin Entertainments, the London Eye owners, spent 5 million creating the film and building the 4D cinema and wanted to improve the value for money of the London Eye.\nWhat to Expect\nThe 4D Cinema entrance is in the ticket hall. So after buying your ticket, go straight to it, where you'll be given a pair of glasses. About 160 visitors will pass through the 4D cinema every 8 minutes so don't worry about waiting time. People in the bright pink cinema are all standing on four levels. The top level is designed for wheelchairs.\nLondon Eye 4D Film\nPut on your glasses and enjoy yourself. The story is about a little girl visiting London with her father and she wants to be higher to get a better view so she comes to the London Eye. It differs from watching the 3D film for all your senses are involved. When it snows on screen, you feel it snows in the cinema. And when you watch the fireworks, you can really smell them.\nFor a short film, less than four minutes, before the main attraction you think you've come for, you are going to love this free extra. I stood there with my mouth wide open at the end as many others did. It's fantastic! The effects are the Hollywood standard as no expense is spared. I was lucky enough to try the film three times on the first day and I still want to go back again.", "id": "high13618.txt"}
