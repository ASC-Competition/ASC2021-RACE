Recently, there is scientific research to _ what we have always known about music. The studies have shown that when people are excited or happy they are more helpful. The opposite happens when people feel aggressive  or under stress. The use of music can influence how helpful people can be.\nDr Adrian North made a study with 256 university students. Half the group took exercise in the gymnasium listening to music which can bring happiness and the other half exercised to aggressive music. When leaving the gym, the students were asked to hand out flyers   in support of the local disabled athlete's foundation.\nThe results showed that nearly half of the group that listened to happy music were willing to hand out flyers. But in the group that heard the aggressive music, less than 20% were willing. This study suggests that our choice of music can influence our willingness to cooperate .\nWhile a study also shows that productivity   can increase with the right choice of background music in the workplace. As music stimulates   workers' minds, job satisfaction is often positively influenced. Other studies have shown that workers who are in a good mood report more job satisfaction than those in a bad mood.\nThese studies show that music can have a powerful influence on a person's ability to cooperate. Moods have a direct influence on cooperation and job satisfaction, etc. These factors also have a direct relationship to the success of a business.", "id": "high4829.txt"}
