You are wrong if you guessed the US, even with the housing bubble   and main sadness. Nor is it the UK, where prices have risen because demand is far from supply. According to a recent survey of 227 cities around the globe, you must go south of the equator   to Australia to find the priciest homes.\nThe report measured a city's housing market along the following guidelines. An \"affordable\" home required three times or less of the average family's income to purchase. At four times earnings, a home fell into the \"unaffordable\" category. And a \"seriously unaffordable\" home needed five times a family's income. In Australia, homes in the least affordable city cost just about 9.5 times the average income. Sydney, Perth, and Melbourne were only a little under this figure.\nAustralian officials offered little comment, apart from a general statement on the _ findings. These prices make the possibility that many Australians will one day own a home largely unbelievable. Land rationing   and excessive development charges have raised prices, and the problem will only be solved through urgent action by the Rudd government.\nSome American cities were also included on the least affordable list, four of which were in California. America is still involved in a mortgage crisis, though, affecting the affordability of homes. Yet a number of US cities garnered \"affordable\" status, namely Dallas and Kansas. Australia had no cities listed in the top fifty places with affordable homes.\nThe survey suggests that you can find affordable homes in most places, just not if you're Australian and choose to live down under.", "id": "high9138.txt"}
