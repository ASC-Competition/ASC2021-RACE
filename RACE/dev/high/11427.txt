They attempt to get at what type of person you are, what motivates you,and what you feel passion for. In a single 500-word piece of writing,\nadmissions officers attempt to gather all about you. _ \nYou can try and guess what the admissions officers like. But that won't work.The essay will sound empty and become another dull piece of writing,which admissions officers get thousands of each year.\nIt is true that admissions officers aren't exactly looking for anything. The answer is just as open-ended as the question itself. If they ask for someone who has inspired you, it could be anyone. It could be a grandmother, a teacher, or even a character from a movie. A lot of people will say their dad. But since you really feel it, you'll have a lot to write about.\nThere are some important things to remember.These admissions officers want good writers. You don't have to be Ernest Hemingway, but you have to be able to form an interesting story.That means revision and editing,cutting out stupid grammar mistakes,reading it over several times,leaving it for a few days and looking at it again. Whatever you do, make sure the essay is as good as possible.\nAlso,you should use exciting language and really make the reader feel the same passion as you do. It also means finding something unique about your point of view, something that other people might not think of.For example,if you want to write about your dad, you can focus on a specific anecdote about him .Admissions officers love personal stories that ring true.", "id": "high11427.txt"}
