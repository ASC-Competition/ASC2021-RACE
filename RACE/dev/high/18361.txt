When and how should tips be given? Generally, you should plan to tip your room steward   $3.00 to $3.50 per person, per day, and plan an equal amount for your dining room waiter, and half of that for the busboy . \nOn most ships, tip the maitre d'  or dining room captain only if you ask for special favors or table-side service; $5 to $10 is normal. Barmen and wine stewards are tipped 10 to 15 percent, but many cruise lines will add this tip to your bar or drink bill. Check the bill to see how it is handled. Also, tips for special services such as salon && spa treatments and room service are left to the guest, depending on services offered. Sometimes tips are placed in envelopes from your cabin's stationery supply. Generally, passengers on cruises of 10 days or less will tip at the end of the cruise; on longer voyages, tipping weekly. \nAs part of a new trend that seems likely to grow, Carnival, Holland America, Norwegian, Princess and Cunard now charge tips to your account  . Norwegian, for example, charges $10 per day, per guest, to cover service in the various dining rooms and your room steward. If you feel this amount needs to be increased or decreased, arrangements can be made onboard the ship, generally at the end of your cruise. \nA few lines do not encourage tipping, including Radisson Seven Seas, Seabourn, Silversea and Windstar. Crew members are reportedly higher paid and not tip dependent. Many passengers tip anyway for outstanding service or special favors and give them tips face to face immediately they get serviced. \nTips on Tipping \nCabin steward \n$3.00 to $3.50 per person per day \nWaiter \n$3.00 to $3.50 per person per day \nAssistant waiter \n$1.50 to $2.00 per person per day \nBartender, wine and deck stewards \n10-15% of the bill \nMaitre d' \n$5.00 to $10.00 tip for each special service", "id": "high18361.txt"}
