That daily question often wastes us time and causes stress. Some people have many clothes and might still think , \"There 's nothing to wear . \"But, what if they have only six items of clothing to choose from and wear for an entire month ? That's the idea behind Six Items or Less.\nSix Items or Less is a social experiment , a gentle way of saying \"no\" to fashion consumerism  and the high cost of clothing . Heidi Hackemer came up with the idea . She shared their idea with her friends . And all of a sudden , they had almost 100 people from around the world saying that they wanted to take part in this experiment .\nIt was an interesting month for them . Hackemer was surprised at how few people noticed that she was wearing the same six items the whole month . Having fewer choices reduced stress in her life . \" I learned what's really important and what's really worth stressing . I also found that this simplicity exists in other parts of my life . I realized that physical things that we allow into our world , really blocks our mind . And our mind can be quite a powerful and positive thing if we cleared up a little bit .\"\nKristy Hogue said the experiment inspired her to reexamine her life . With six items , at first she was really excited and everything was working out perfectly and she never got bored . Then she started to feel a little bored . Then she eventually accepted it and started to be more relaxed . \nAlexander was one of the 40 men \"sixers\". The most difficult part for him was having to wash clothes by hand every day . But the experiment changed his opinion on what makes people happy . \"We have many choices for everything . But all those choices don't necessarily lead up to any kind of satisfaction . We are crazy about novelty . In fact , slowing down a little bit and considering your choices a little tightly , actually leads to more time , more happiness and more content .", "id": "high21240.txt"}
