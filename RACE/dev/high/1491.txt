To many people the cause is obvious  : they eat too much. But scientific evidence   does little to support this idea. Going back to America of 1910, we find that people were thinner than today, yet they at e more food. In those days people worked harder physically, walked more, used machines much less, and didn't watch television.\nSeveral modern studies, moreover, have shown that fatter people don't eat more on average than thinner people. A 1979 study of 3,545 London office workers showed that fat people eat less than slim   people.\nStudies also show that slim people are more active than fat people. A study by a research group at Stanford University found the following interesting facts:\nThe more the man ran, the greater loss of the body fat.\nThe more they ran, the greater increase in food intake.\nThus, those who ran the most ate the most, yet lost the greatest amount of body fat.", "id": "high1491.txt"}
