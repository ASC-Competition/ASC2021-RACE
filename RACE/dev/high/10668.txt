And late-airport people would be punished. But early-airport people getulcers , heart attacks and bite their fingernails to the bone. Late-airport people almost don't realize they are flying.\nA guy of that kind once said, \"Don't hurry. If you miss your flight, it's because God doesn't want you to go.\" This is clearly a guy who is never going to get an ulcer.\nEarly-airport people suffer another \"name\". They are called exactly what they are -wimps . I know. I was an early-airport person for years. \"My baggage will get on the plane first,\" I told myself.

I thought it was a trick. I thought there was someone in America who called every airline every day and said: \"Is that wimp Simon flying somewhere today?
