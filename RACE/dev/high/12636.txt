If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.\nStepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path.", "id": "high12636.txt"}
