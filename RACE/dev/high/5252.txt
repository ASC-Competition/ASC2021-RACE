But explaining a clear connection to weather is harder.\n\"Our research confirms the observed connection between solar change and regional winter climate,\" lead author Sarah Ineson of the UK Met Office told the reporters in an email. The study was published in the magazine Nature Geoscience on Monday.\nThe researchers found that the reducing of ultraviolet(UV,) radiation from the sun can affect high-altitude wind patterns in the Northern Hemisphere , causing cold winters.\n\"While UV levels won't tell us what the day-to-day weather will do, they show us the bright future of improved forecasts for winter conditions for months and even years ahead. These forecasts play an important role in long-term possibility planning,\" Ineson, a climate scientist, said.\nIneson and colleagues from Imperial College London and the University of Oxford used satellite data that more accurately  measures UV radiation from the sun and found a much greater change than previously thought.\nThey found that in years of low activity, unusually cold air forms high in the atmosphere over the tropics. This causes a redistribution  of heat in the atmosphere, making easterly winds that bring freezing weather and snowstorms to northern Europe and the United States and milder weather to Canada and the Mediterranean.\nWhen solar UV radiation is stronger, the opposite occurs.\nMore study was needed, though. A key uncertainty in the experiment lay in the satellite data used, because it covers only a few years. \"So questions remain concerning both accuracy  and also applicability to other solar cycles,\" she said.", "id": "high5252.txt"}
