I am a wife. And, not altogether incidentally, I am a mother.\nNot too long ago a male friend of mine appeared on the scene fresh from a recent divorce. He had one child, who is, of course, with his ex-wife. He is obviously looking for another wife. As I thought about him while I was ironing one evening, it suddenly occurred to me that I, too, would like to have a wife. Why do I want a wife?\nI would like to go back to school so that I can become economically independent, support myself, and if needed, support those dependent upon me. I want a wife who will work and send me to school. And while I am going to school, I want a wife to take care of my children. I want a wife to keep track of the children's doctor. And to keep track of mine, too. I want a wife to make sure my children eat properly and are kept clean. I want a wife who will wash the children's clothes and keep them mended. I want a wife who takes care of the children when they are sick, a wife who arranges to be around when the children need special care, because, of course, I cannot miss classes at school. My wife must arrange to lose time at work and not lose the job. It may mean a small cut in my wife's income from time to time, but I guess I can tolerate that. Needless to say, my wife will arrange and pay for the care of the children while my wife is working.\nI want a wife who will take care of my physical needs. I want a wife who will keep my house clean. I want a wife who will keep my clothes cleaned, ironed, mended, replaced and who cooks the meals, does the necessary grocery shopping, prepares the meals, serves them pleasantly, and then does the cleaning up while I do my studying. I want a wife who will care for me when I am sick and sympathize with my pain and loss of time from school.\nI want a wife who will take care of the details of my social life. When my wife and I are invited out by my friends, I want a wife who will take care of the babysitting arrangements. When I meet people at school that I like and want to entertain, I want a wife who will have the house cleaned and prepare a special meal and serve it to me and my friends and will not interrupt when I talk about the things that interest me and my friends.\nIf, by chance, I find another person more suitable as a wife than the wife I already have, I want the liberty to replace my present wife with another one. Naturally, I will expect a fresh, new life: My wife will take the children and be only responsible for them so that I am left free.\nWhen I am through with school and have a job, I want my wife to stop working and remain at home so that my wife can more fully and completely take care of a wife's duties.\nMy God, who wouldn't want a wife?", "id": "high16769.txt"}
