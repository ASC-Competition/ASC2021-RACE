One day , Mrs. O'Neil gave a maths test to our class . When the papers were marked , she found that twelve boys had made exactly the same mistakes in the test .\nThere is nothing new about cheating in exams . Perhaps that was why Mrs. O'Neil didn't even say one word about it . She only asked the twelve boys to stay after class . I was one of the twelve .\nMrs. O'Neil asked no questions , and she didn't scold us , either . Instead , she wrote the following words on the blackboard : On your way home you find some money and you're completely sure that you will never be found out . Later someone comes to ask you if you have found some money he lost . What will you do ?\nShe then ordered us to write down the question , and asked us to take our whole lives to try to find out our own answer to it .\nI don't know about the other eleven children . Speaking for myself I can say : it was the most important single thing of my life. From then on , I have been asking this question to myself when I have to make a decision .\nBecause of this , Mrs . O'Neil has become the most unforgettable teacher for me in my whole life . I often think of this : if Mrs . O'Neil had scolded us as many other teachers often did , would I go on cheating every day ?", "id": "high15297.txt"}
