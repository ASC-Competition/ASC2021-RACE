I was afraid I just couldn't hide my excitement as it had been five years since I had been to the zoo. I was especially excited about getting to see the penguin exhibit that was completed since my last visit. I thought it would be just as magical as it was the last time.\nThe Tulsa Zoo is located on Mohawk Park, and covers 84 acres, making it the third largest zoo in the US. The zoo has several highlights, but I have to admit that I found myself rather disappointed. The maintenance is deeply lacking, and most of the exhibits, landscaping, etc. looked like it had not been updated or well kept. Unfortunately, their polar bear died a short time ago. The strangest attraction was the missing-in-action jaguar  . We spent several minutes searching for the animal without any luck. In most cases the zoo was good about putting up a sign if the animal was no longer there or was moved to a different location, but it was a different case with the jaguar and likewise the kangaroo.\nAlmost all of the hands-on equipment in the elephant encounter was broken and no longer working. Although the zoo did put up signs as an apology, it continued to add to the feeling that the zoo is approaching death. The one exhibit that did not fail to impress was the African Penguins. Their habitat was well built. The lion, bear, and tiger were also easy to watch. A favorite among the kids was clearly the monkeys who were very active and eager to put on a show.\nThe Tropical Rainforest did a very good job creating a special atmosphere. The cafe served very good food and had lovely indoor and outdoor areas for eating. They are currently re-designing the Sea Lion exhibit, so the Sea Lions were not available for viewing while we were there. All things considered, the Tulsa Zoo is still the best zoo in our area, but I would only award it three out of five stars.", "id": "high9067.txt"}
