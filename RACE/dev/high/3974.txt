He had his first big boy haircut. Before today, we have always stood by his side, told the hairdresser what to do and watched over the whole thing. We've been working on the rewards   of responsibility with my son for quite some time. Today, he got one of those rewards by having his own haircut.\nWhen they arrived at the shop, his father showed him a book with lots of styles of haircuts for boys. After he made his choice, he waited patiently for his turn. My husband decided he would get his own hair cut at the same time.\nWhen their names were called, Kevin showed the hairdresser the picture of his chosen haircut, which, thankfully, was not a strange haircut. The hairdresser looked to my husband for approval   and he told her his son was in charge.\nDuring his haircut, Kevin talked happily with the hairdresser. My husband, who was getting his haircut in the next chair, kept silent. When all was said and done, Kevin looked quite handsome.\nWhen it was time to pay, he reached into his pocket and took out the cash my husband gave him. He handed it to her and said, \"Thanks, it's all yours.\" I guess that's the six-year-old equivalent   of \"keep the change.\"\nI have to admit I was a little nervous about the whole thing before, but I'm a believer now. My son is growing up and ready for new big boy experiences.", "id": "high3974.txt"}
