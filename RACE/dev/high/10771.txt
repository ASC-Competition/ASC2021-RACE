Once you are in the habit of rushing through life,being on the go from morning till night,it is hard to slow down. But relaxation is necessary for a healthy mind and body.\nStress is a natural part of everyday life and there is no way to avoid it. In fact,it is not the bad thing it is often supposed to be. A certain amount of stress is vital to provide motivation and give purpose to life. It is only when the stress gets out of control that it can lead to poor performance and ill health.\nThe amount of stress a person can bear depends very much on the individual. Some people are not afraid of stressand such characters are obviously important material for managerial responsibilities. Others lose heart at the first signs of unusual difficulties.
