So far, the team's members have raised $4,500. That's enough to purchase and protect more than 16 acres of rainforest in Costa Rica through the Center for Ecosystem survival.\nEvery year, thousands of square miles of rainforest are destroyed worldwide. Logging and farming are mostly likely to blame, scientists say. The loss is terrible news for animals and people. Even though rainforests cover less than 2 percent of the earth, they are home to half the world's plants and animals. Rainforests also provide water and help control the earth's climate.\nEvan's work to save the rainforests recently earned him a Barron prize for Young Heroes. The prizes are given to children or teenagers who have made a positive difference in the world. Evan's goal is \"to save enough rainforests to last forever\". He won't have to do it alone. His actions have already inspired other kids to chip in. One girl asked for donations instead of presents on her birthday. She raised $850. Other kids are starting their own conservation teams.\nEvan says everyone can help the planet-even by taking small steps such as recycling. He and his family try to make a difference every day. \"We recycle, we try to limit our garbage... we've been walking a little more, and we buy local food,\" Evan said.", "id": "high11532.txt"}
