The researchers said previous theories about how we appreciate music were based on the physical functions of sound, the ear itself and a born ability to hear harmony.\nThe study shows that musical harmony can be learnt, and it is a matter of training the brain to hear the sounds. So if you thought that the music of some foreign culture (or Jazz) sounded like the crying of cats, it's simply because you haven't learnt to listen by their rules.\nThe researchers used 66 volunteers with a range of musical training and tested their ability to hear combinations of notes  to determine if they found the combinations familiar or pleasing. They found that people needed to be familiar with combinations of notes. If they found the notes unfamiliar they also found the sound unpleasant. This finding put an end to centuries of theories claiming that physical functions of the ear determine what we find attractive.\nThe study found that trained musicians were much more sensitive to unpleasant notes than non-musicians. When they couldn't find the note, the musicians reported that the sounds were unpleasant, while non-musicians were much less sensitive. This shows the importance of training or nurturing  the brain to like particular sound of combinations of notes, like those found in jazz or rock.\nDepending on their training, a strange chord  sound was pleasant to some musicians, but very unpleasant to others. This showed us that even the ability to hear a musical note is learnt.\nTo confirm this finding, they trained 19 non-musicians to find the notes of a random selection of western chords. Not only did the participants' ability to hear notes improve rapidly, afterward they reported that the chords they had learnt sounded more pleasant -- regardless of how the chords were played.\nThe question of why some combinations of musical notes are heard as pleasant or unpleasant has long been debated. \"We have shown in this study that for music, beauty is in the brain of the beholder \", a researcher said.", "id": "high5887.txt"}
