All the road markings and signs are shown in two languages -- English and Welsh  . Not all visitors to Britain know that other languages are spoken here. There's the Gaelic   language in Scotland and a few people speak Cornish  in the southwest of England, but the most widely spoken language in the UK besides English is Welsh.\nPerhaps the first Welsh word you'll see on the road into Wales is ARAF. There's a helpful English translation next to it -- SLOW. As you can see, Welsh looks quite different from English. It sounds very different, too. Welsh looks and sounds so different from English because it's a Celtic language. Celtic cultures still exist around the edges of the UK -- in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and also in parts of France. For hundreds of years, almost everyone in Wales spoke Welsh, but nowadays there are about 600 thousand Welsh speakers -- around 20% of the population.\nSo is Welsh dying out? Not at all! Nowadays, all school children in Wales study Welsh and many choose to go to an all Welsh-speaking school. You can get public information in Welsh, speak Welsh in court or take a course at university in Welsh. People surf the Internet in Welsh, keep up with friends on Facebook and write blogs in Welsh.\nBy the way,\"Croeso I Gymru!\" means \"Welcome to Wales!\"  I hope you'll be able to visit it one day.", "id": "high14448.txt"}
