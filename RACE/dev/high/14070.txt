Put a dog, a kid and a book together, and you have a struggling reader's best friend.\nThe therapy dogs of R.E.A.D. - Reading Education Assistance Dogs - have been helping children improve their reading skills since 1999, when Intermountain Therapy Animals (ITA) began the program in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nToday, tens of thousands of R.E.A.D. teams - dogs and their owners - volunteer to spend time with youngsters in schools and libraries across the United States and around the world. The idea is that sharing a book with a nonjudgmental   partner encourages students' confidence and helps develop a love of reading.\nIzzy, a Havanese therapy dog, is a regular visitor to Public School 57 in East Harlem, New York. Students meet him in the library, pick out a book and sit down on the carpet. Izzy snuggles   up to them and gets ready to hear a story.\n\"I love reading to Izzy because he listens to me, and he doesn't make fun of me when I make a mistake,\" says third-grader Aelane Vasquez. The 9-year-old, whose parents are from Mexico, is one of 15 Latin-American students at the school who were selected for the program.\n\"All the students that we work with in the R.E.A.D. program were behind reading levels at the beginning of the year,\" Bridget McElroy, who teaches English as a Second Language, explained. \"Now most of them have reached the average level, if not above it.\" That's important, because achieving proficiency   in reading is vital for kids to succeed. Studies have shown that students who can't read at grade level by the end of third grade are four times less likely to graduate high school by the age of 19.\nThe R.E.A.D. teams from New York Therapy Animals work with 175 kids at Public School 57 and nine other schools.\nMcElroy said she sees a marked difference in Aelane and her classmates, and not just in study. \"Not only do the kids have time to practice reading, what we are really seeing is that they are excited to read and practice even when Izzy is not here,\" she said.", "id": "high14070.txt"}
