He may be an attractive movie star, but there's more to Josh Duhamel than a pretty face. The 40-year-old actor led a youth charity fun run for the third year running on Sunday, in aid of the Red Cross giving a hand to countries and places suffering natural disasters.\nJosh sported the charity's T-shirt and black baseball cap with black jogging bottoms as he joined a group of youngsters in the two-mile effort on Santa Monica Beach. Josh was clearly enjoying himself today, sprinting across the finish line raising both arms in a victory salute.\nIn March last year and January of 2010, Josh led thousands of runners and raised over $200,000 for both Japanese and Haitian earthquake relief efforts. And donations collected at this year's Youth Run will go towards the American Red Cross PrepareSoCal campaign which helps Southern Californians get ready for disasters.\n\"I do the youth run because I feel that younger people may not be able to donate a lot of money but that doesn't mean that they can't contribute and make a difference,\" Josh told the Red Cross website. \"Bringing students of L. A. together for these events not only raises a lot of money, but also raises the spirits of those affected by any disaster and helps everyone young and old.\"\nDuhamel had won the title of Male Model of the Year in an International Modeling and Talent Association competition in 1997. Duhamel began his acting career as an extra in the music videos for Donna Summer's song, \"I Will Go With You\" in 1998. Later that year, he won the role of Leo Pres on the ABC soap opera \"All My Children\". He then began appearing in films, and his acting in the film \"Transformers\" as well as its sequels was so successful that he became a pop film star.", "id": "high6009.txt"}
