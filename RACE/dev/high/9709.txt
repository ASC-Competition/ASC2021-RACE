But instead they are the \"Ipod\" generation --\"Insecure, Pressured, Over-taxed and Debt-ridden\"--according to a study by a group of experts who provide advice and ideas on social issues.\n\"We thought that each generation would be better off than its predecessors  ,\" said Professor Nick Bosanquet of Imperial College London, one of its authors. \"But young people today have more duties and it is much more difficult for them to raise their incomes and create wealth. This really is a very big issue for the country.\"\nAccording to the report, today's youth don't have enough confidence and ability to build on the economic foundations created by post-war baby boomers   . Because they are in debt, they are also _ to take risks. Levels of entrepreneurship   among Britain's youth are lower than in America, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland and have fallen over the past decade. Many choose the jobs which offer a good amount of money after they retire. Others have to take any job that is available to try to pay off their debts.\n\"I borrowed a lot of money from the bank to pay for my education at university, which is the biggest chain around my neck now,\" said Phil Grech, 22, from Cumbria, who has a degree in maths from the University of Reading. \"I'm only doing a temporary job at the moment to pay the mounting bills. I haven't really thought about the long term. Many people think that when you leave university you can get a good job, but it's no longer like that.\"\nWhile older generations enjoyed higher education funded by taxpayers, young people today face university tuition fees and a decreasing \"return\" in the salary advantage they will get from their degrees.", "id": "high9709.txt"}
