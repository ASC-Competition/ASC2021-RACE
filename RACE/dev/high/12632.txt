With a social worker mother, the Sutton children. had inherited her commitment to service, and knew never to take their good fortune at Christmas for granted. This year, Kinzie, her seven-year-old daughter was thrilled that Santa Claus would make a special visit to a 22-year-old mother named Ashley who worked in a factory raising her 12-month-old son by herself.\nThe phone rang on Sunday. A representative from a local organization was calling to say that the aid Ann had requested for Ashley had fallen through. No Santa Claus, no presents, nothing.\nAnn saw the cheer fade away from her children's faces at the news.  Without a word, Kinzie ran into her bedroom. She returned,  her face set with determination.\nOpening up her piggy bank, she put all the coins onto the table:  $3.30.  Everything she had.\n\"Mom,\" she told Ann, \"I know it's not much. But maybe this will buy a present for the baby.\"\nAt a breakfast meeting the next day, Ann told her coworkers about her daughter story. To her surprise, staff members began to open their purses. and empty  their pockets to help Kinzie .On Christmas Eve, Ann drove through the pouring rain to the small trailer where the Ashley's lived. Then she began to unload the gifts from the car, handing them to Ashley one by one.\nAshley was very moved. Reflecting on a little girl's generosity, Ashley says she'll one day be able to do something similar for someone else in need.  \"Kinzie could have used that money for herself, but she gave it away,\" Ashley says. \"She's the  type of kid I'd like my son to  grow up to be.\"", "id": "high12632.txt"}
