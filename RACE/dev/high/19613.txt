A study showed that 25% of young children feel they couldn't live any more if you took away their name. Another study shows that about one third of all young people wish their parents had given them a different name.\nIn many cultures, there are special ideas about how to choose a name. For example, many people choose a name that has been in their family for many years. It tells the child where he or she has come from.\nChoosing a good name isn't easy. Many parents search books that tell them the meanings of names. They could choose a name that carries a message. For example, Edith means \"valuable gift\". Amanda means \"love\". And Fara means \"joy\".\nNames like these tell family and friends how happy they are with their new baby. Other names can say something about the events during the birth of the child. In Africa, a first born son may have the name Mosi and the name Ama means \"born on Saturday\".\nBut can our names influence our lives? Some experts say that they can, but others disagree. Is every girl called Malak like an angel? Is every boy called Curitis polite? And is every girl called Mahira quick and full of energy? No parent can tell what kind of person their child will grow up to be. Just because parents name a boy Fahim, it doesn't mean he will be clever. All they can do is to hope.", "id": "high19613.txt"}
