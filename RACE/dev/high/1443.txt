Suddenly he saw a beautiful painting lying on the floor. John picked it up and gave it to the director of the museum.\nThe director called several museums to check and see if it was a stolen painting, but no one claimed   it. So the director decided to hang it in the museum. All the experts came to look at the painting. Each one said it was beautiful and had very deep meaning. The director was proud to have such a painting in his museum and congratulated John on his discovery.\nSome weeks later a woman and her little son came to the museum. While they were looking at the new painting, the little boy began to cry. The director went over and asked him.\n\"Why are you crying?\"\nThe child pointed to the painting and said, \"That's my painting on the wall and I want it back.\"\n\"Yes,\" said his mother, \"he left it on the floor a few weeks ago. If you look carefully, you can see his name on the painting.\"", "id": "high1443.txt"}
