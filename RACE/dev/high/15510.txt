Sound like something out of a science fiction movie? Think again.\nOn February 21, New Zealand fishermen landed a colossal squid the length of a school bus. They had been fishing with long lines for Chilean sea bass   in the waters off the coast of New Zealand when they caught the rare squid. With two hours of hard work, the crew skillfully pulled the creature into a net and dragged it aboard their ship.\nScientists estimate   that the animal weighs about a half ton and is about 40 feet long. That would make this colossal squid the biggest on record.\nFirst identified in 1925 after two tentacles were found in a whale's stomach, the colossal squid has long been a mystery. The animals are not easy to observe because they can go down to ocean depths of 6,500 feet. What scientists do know from studying the bodies of a half dozen colossal squids is that they are fierce hunters.\nThe recently captured colossal squid has been frozen to keep it for scientific study. It will be transported to New Zealand's national museum, Te Papa, in the capital city of Wellington. Experts believe it to be the first adult male ever caught undamaged. Scientists hope to learn more about the colossal squid's diet, behavior and reproductive   patterns.\n\"Scientists will be very interested in this amazing creature,\" said New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton. \"It adds immeasurably to our understanding of the marine environment.\"", "id": "high15510.txt"}
