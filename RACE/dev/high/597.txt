A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time.\nHis grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC.\n\"I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight,\" Dickinson told KABC.\nThat's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the air bridge waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal.\n\"I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,'\"Dickinson told KABC.\nAuthorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana  at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel.\nThanks to the pilot, Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the sympathetic pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were praiseworthy.\n\"You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating  circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision,\" Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. \"I don't think you could ask for a better example of great service for our customers.\"", "id": "high597.txt"}
