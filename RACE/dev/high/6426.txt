Everyone was having a wonderful time visiting and catching up on all the latest family news.\nLike most children, Tegan was having a good time playing with all the toys that were different from her own and that were kept for children to play with at her grandparents' house. In particular, Tegan had found a little tea set and had begun pretending that she was having a tea party. She set up all the place settings and arranged her table with the great care and elegance that only a three-year-old can create. Meanwhile, her Daddy _ conversation, and as he continued to chat with his family, Tegan would hand him a cup of \"tea\".
