And a British newspaper devoted its front page to a picture supposedly showing how mobile phones heat the brain.For anyone who uses a mobile phone,these are worring times.But speak to the scientists whose work is the focus of these scared and you will hear a different story.\nWhat we do have,however,are some results suggesting that mobile phones'emission  have a variety of strange effects on living tissue that can't be explained by the general radiation biology.And it's only when the questions raised by these experiments are answered that we'll be able to say for sure what moblie phones might be doing to the brain.\nOne of the strange effects comes from the now famous \"memory loss\" study Alan Preece and his colleagues at the University of Bristol placed a device  that copied the microwave emission of mobile phones to the left ear of volunteers.The volunteers were all good at recalling words and pictures they had been shown on a computer screen.Preece says he still can't comment on the effects of using a mobile phone for years on end.But he rules out the suggestion that mobile phones have an immediate effect on our cognitive  abilities.\"I'm pretty sure there is no effect on short-term memory,\"he says.\nAnother expert,Tatterasll,remarked that his latest findings have removed fears about memory loss.One result,for instance,suggests that nerve cell synapses  exposed to microwaves become more--rather than less--receptive to under--going changes linked to the memory formation.\nIt would be an even happier outcome if microwave turned out to be good for you.It sounds crazy,but a couple of years ago a team led by William Adey at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in California,found that mice exposed to microwave for two hours a day were less likely to develop brain tumours  when given a cancer--causing chemical.\nSo should we forget about mobile phone radiation causing brain tumours and making us unable to think clearly or reasonably?\n\"If it doesn't certainly cause cancer in animals and cells, then it probably isn't going to cause cancer in humans,\"says William.And while there's still no absolute evidence that mobile phone does damage your memories or give your cancer,the _ is:Don't panic.", "id": "high15018.txt"}
