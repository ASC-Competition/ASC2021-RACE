A stupid joke at that. I mean, what sort of _ would take a perfectly good, perfectly famous bridge and move it halfway around the world to some no-name town in northwest Arizona? Back in 1962 when all this started, Lake Havasu City was nothing. A couple of shops, a couple of homes, and no tourism at all.\nIt turns out Robert McCulloch is the moron in question, and he wasn't quite the moron I thought he was. His 2.45 million dollar investment in the 130-year-old bridge--which the British government was selling because it was about to fall into the Thames--ended up being the investment of a lifetime. You see McCulloch was a real businessman, among other things, and his money paid off big. He turned Lake Havasu into one of the most visited tourist attractions in Arizona.\nIt took nine long years to take down the bridge, ship it brick by brick to the middle of nowhere, and build it up again. When it finally did open up in 1971, it was a huge deal covered by the international press.\nThe bridge is now a popular tourist attraction, and there's even a mini \"English Village\" at the foot of the bridge with souvenirs and real British food so you can have a good old time.\nNowadays Lake Havasu is a busy town with a population of about 56,000 citizens and another2.5 million visitors each year. Most of that is during spring break when the town overflows with energetic boys and girls. Even MTV and the Girls Gone Wild people get in on the action. All thanks to that little bridge.\nI don't know about you, but I'm saving my pennies. When the French get sick of that Eiffel Tower, I'll be the first to put money on it. It'll look great in my backyard.", "id": "high11099.txt"}
