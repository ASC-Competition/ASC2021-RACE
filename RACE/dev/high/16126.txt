For what more could you ask than comradeship during the peaks and valleys of life? To whom else but a close, valuable friend can you show off your successes and complain about your failures or losses?\nWhat is a \"good friend\"? How is he best described? Well, it has been my observation that although many will cry with you, few can sincerely rejoice   with you. Therefore, in my opinion, a good friend is one who can enjoy your successes without envy; one who can say, \"That was wonderful! You can do it again, even better if you want!\" and mean it.\n. Even the closest of friendships often cannot resist such pressure and fail. No wonder many minor friendships go down day by day for the same reason.\nA person of good character and sound moral, of honor and humor, of courage and belief is a friend to be sought and treasured -- for there are few. Too often we hear, \"If you can count your good friends on more than one hand, consider yourself blessed.\"\nWhat makes a friendship last? Well, I don't know all the answers, but one of my observations is that most good friends usually have similar tastes. They generally like and dislike many of the same things. There also usually seems to exist a similarity of personality types -- especially in the fundamental values of life such as honesty, sincerity, loyalty, and dependability. More often than not, birds of a feather do fly together. I don't think it matters a lot whether one prefers jazz or hockey to another's Mozart or ballet. Much other matters far more: relying, sharing, giving, getting, enjoying; a sympathetic ear always there; criticism when it can help; praise -- even if only because it would help. With not many people on this earth will you find this much in common. When you find one, hang on to him, for a good friend found is a rare treasure.", "id": "high16126.txt"}
