I'm clear that I'm never going to catch up with Mother Teresa. But I want to do something to help people every single day like her.\nEverybody thinks we just serve food and soda. The safety training is serious and stressful. Caring for 49 people in a business class in 90 minutes is not easy. I had a roommate who was a waitress; she just left a candle and a table cloth burning, and I used a fire extinguisher   to put out the fire. If something goes bad at her job, she calls the police. But if something happens up in the air, it's up to us.\nI'm single and have no kids. I've flown every Christmas since 1995. If I fly, someone else can be with their kids. Christmas in an airport can be depressing, but it's the little things that make a difference.\n _ . It's hard to put on a smile and just pretend everything is great when it isn't. I've seen co-workers lose a family member the day before a trip and just pull themselves together (take control of their feelings and believe in a calm way).

You can't wait to turn off the flight attendant's voice and get something to eat without anyone saying \"Excuse me.\"\nSometimes I go all day and never hear a \"please\" or a \"thank you.\" When you say thank you, it's huge. It makes us feel like you actually see us as fellow humans. We're up there together at a height of 30,000 feet, enjoying the miracle   of the modern flight.", "id": "high12016.txt"}
