The money will enab4 Love 146 to bui4 a home in the UK to provide specialist aftercare to  victims of child trafficking.\n The run - the equivalent of 39 marathons in 30 days - will take in nine different countries and pass through some of Eastern Europe's most remote terrain , without the help  of support vehicles or medical aid.The three men will carry everything they need, sleeping where they can and finding food and water along the way.\n\"What really inspires us is the idea that people will join us at various points along the way,  Forrest Gump-style,\" says Tom.If that sounds like your idea of fun,  it's not too late to sign up on their website and join them for a spot of extreme fundraising over the next month.The aim is to arrive in Dubrovnik on 3 May.\nOnly days before they set off, I asked Tom what his biggest concern was at this late Stage.''The cold,\" he said.\"We hadn't imagined Europe would be this cold in April.Some nights the plan is to sleep outside in the camping bags.I'm terrified about the weather.\"", "id": "high23801.txt"}
