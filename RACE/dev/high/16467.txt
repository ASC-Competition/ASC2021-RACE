Yet, at the end of the effort, not much changes. What happens?\nIn most cases, those new plans, programs and employees enter a company with an existing culture  . And plans, programs and new employees have a way of conforming to the existing culture. The culture of your business is the result of a particular mindset, or a particular way of thinking and the general feelings about certain things. Most often, it is the mindset of the founder or people managing the business.\nThe founder has gotten to where he is because of his skill sets, knowledge base and personal beliefs, which unfortunately all come with inherent  limits. Why Skills, knowledge and beliefs come from what he or she already knows or has experienced. In other words, it comes from the past. We (people) try to make the past fit the future. Just because something worked in the past, doesn't mean it is suitable for the future.
