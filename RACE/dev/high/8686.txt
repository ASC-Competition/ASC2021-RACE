Older relatives, English teachers and the media always praise him. But when you actually take the time to read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you find that his work is more wonderful than you could've ever imagined.\nThe novel describes a young boy named Tom Sawyer growing up in a small town along the Mississippi River. He explores the countryside on a riverboat with his friends, falls in love with girls, starts secret clubs and searches for treasure. Twain's idea of childhood is magical - a time of imagination, wonder and, of course, adventure.\nMore importantly, through the eyes of Tom Sawyer, Twain cleverly makes fun of US culture. For example, Tom hates going to church, and Twain uses scenes of Tom there to _ religion   and its old traditions. \"Often, the less there is to justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it,\" he writes in one chapter.\nTwain's writing is full of these kinds of critical   points about culture and politics. That's why he is so loved in the US - he wasn't afraid to state his opinions, and he did so clearly. For instance, Twain didn't like US wars abroad. In 1900, after the US invaded   the Philippines, Twain wrote in a newspaper article: \"We do not intend to free, but to subjugate   the people of the Philippines... We have gone there to conquer.\" He also believed strongly in women's right to vote in elections and gave a famous speech on the subject, called \"Votes for Women\", in 1901.\n\"Tom was a glittering hero once more - the pet of the old, the envy of the young,\" Twain writes in Tom Sawyer. But he could just as well be describing himself.", "id": "high8686.txt"}
