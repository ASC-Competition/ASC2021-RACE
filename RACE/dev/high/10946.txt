That's why university rankings play such a vital role in students searching for their next academic direction. Rankings are also an inescapable part of the reputation and brand image of universities. \"No university website is complete without the claim to be in the top 100 for something or other,\" reported the BBC. The reason is simple: Rankings help them to attract students, staff and research investment.\nCurrently there are numbers of university rankings, and each has its own list of criteria. But the main categories are the same: academic reputation, graduates' performance and faculty resources.\nHowever, experts point out the ranking process isn't entirely reliable. Mark Kantrowitz, a US financial aid researcher, said university rankings were mostly just for show. He wrote in The New York Times. \"It may give your parents better bragging rights, but that's about it.\"\nMoreover, it's not difficult to see the limitations of university rankings.

It can also add an element that rankings can never convey -- the actual emotion of a university experience.\"", "id": "high10946.txt"}
