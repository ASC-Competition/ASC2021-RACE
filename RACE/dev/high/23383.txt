He found out that the monkey was cleverer than other animals.\n   In one test the professor put a monkey in a room where there were several small boxes. Some boxes were inside other boxes. One small box had some food inside of it. The professor wanted to watch the monkey and to find out how long it would take the monkey to find the food. The professor left the room. He waited a few minutes outside the door. Then he got down on his knees and put his eye to the keyhole. What did he see? To his surprise he found himself looking into the eye of the monkey. The monkey was on the other side of the door and looked at the professor through the keyhole.", "id": "high23383.txt"}
