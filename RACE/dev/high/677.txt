You see different foods, clothes and sometimes physical characteristics of people. You observe new customs or habits, such as the use of chopsticks, and, bowing or kissing on both cheeks as a greeting. These differences are interesting and important, but they are usually not too difficult to understand. They are visible so they are seen easily and quickly.\nThe part of culture that is like the underwater part of the iceberg _ assumptions , communication styles, values, and beliefs about what is right and wrong.
