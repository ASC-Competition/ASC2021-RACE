Her mother did not answer, only stared blankly at the scene below. Crowds of people marched about with what looked like picket  signs. Other people gathered around them, shouting angry words that she couldn't make out from this distance. This relatively small town in Missouri had never seen so much action. She and Susie were standing at the top of the only high rise building in town for Susie loved to try to find their house among the rows and rows of little boxes.\n\"Momma? \" Susie said in a frightened voice, two seconds before a gun shot went off, making her scream at the top of her lungs. Her mom grabbed her and held her over her shoulder as the tears started pouring. \"What was that? I'm scared, Momma!!\"\n\"Sh Sh Sh,\" her momma whispered in a soothing tone, rubbing her daughter's hair. \"It's just a bad dream, baby.

It's just bugs dancing,\" Susie said with an innocent smile, wiping away her mother's tears.", "id": "high14573.txt"}
