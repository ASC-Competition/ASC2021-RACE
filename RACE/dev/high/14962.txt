Local specialty food may not be popular among all people, but it offers outsiders a glimpse of local culture and history.\nGongcheng \"oil tea\" is such a kind of food that would be considered \"weird\" by many first-time visitors to the remote county in the north of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Many people dislike its bitter and astringent  flavor when they take a sip.\n\"It felt like drinking Chinese herbal medicine. I never expected that I would gradually accept it afterwards, and even become addicted to it,\" said a traveler surnamed Zhang who comes from Shijiazhuang in northern China's Hebei province.\nLangshan village is said to be the birthplace of Gongcheng \"oil tea\" whose ideal ingredients are green tea and fermented tea. The village has preserved well its buildings and roads dating back to late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), as well as its traditional way of making the special tea.\nLin Fengyou, 60, introduced the cooking process.
