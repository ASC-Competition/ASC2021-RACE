The words used by young people in the UK can be very different to those used by adults. These extremely informal words and expressions are known as \"slang\". Here are a few examples:\n*Instead of using different tag question like isn't it? Can't you or don't they? People use \"innit\".e.g. It's hot here, isn't it?=\"It's\" hot here, innit!\n*Instead of saying very, really or completely, they use \"well\". e.g. I'm well tired.\n* \"Whatever\" means \"I don't care\". e.g. A: But the teacher says we can't leave until we've finished. B:Whatever. I'm going.\nNobody uses slang and not everybody likes it. A school in Sheffield, in the north of England, recently instructed its pupils to stop using slang words. The head teacher says that if young people learn to speak 'correctly' this will help them get a good job.\nWhen British people use slang, it's no surprise that some students say they can't understand native speakers. But perhaps learners don't need to worry about communicating with native speakers so much. Research shows that most of the English spoken in the world today is spoken between non-native speakers of the language. In fact, when we think about \"International English\", there is no such thing as a native or non-native speaker.\nHow important is it to understand these slang words and expressions? If you watch films or TV, chat online in English, then understanding slang can be very useful. But you probably won't see much slang in your English exam though. With over seven billion people living on our planet today, it's easy to think one person's actions won't make a difference, however, from personal experience, I can say: each of us is capable of making a difference, however small, to someone's life.", "id": "high11648.txt"}
