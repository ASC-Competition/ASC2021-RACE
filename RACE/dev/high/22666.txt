But I never remember to look right instead of left before I cross the road. If I stayed for a year, I still wouldn't remember.\" \nHiroshi, from Japan, can't understand why British people keep their shoes on at home. \" If a visitor kept his shoes on at home in Japan, we'd think he was very rude or very dirty. I also can't understand why British people don't wash before getting into the bath. They wash themselves in the bath, in their own dirty water! I wouldn't feel clean if I had a bath in that way. \"\nCecila Vargas, from Spain, noticed that \" strange\" way British people greet each other .\"They seem to be afraid of touching each other .When they meet , they just smile and look embarrassed! If I didn't kiss or hug my friends in Spain, they'd be very surprised. We always greet each other like that. It's perfectly normal. \"\nRoberto, Grazzi, from Italy, couldn't understand why British people queue so much.\"At a bus stop or in a post office, they always stand in a line--- even if there is only one other person!
