Graduating from a top university might not be enough. A new study from the University of Essex in Britain has shown that the more friends you have in school, the more money you'll earn later.\nThe idea that popularity could have a serious influence on one's earning potential shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The researchers noted that if you want to get ahead in life, social skills and networking are easily as powerful as talent and hard work.\n\"If a person has lots of friends, it means that he or she has the ability to get along with others in all kinds of different situations,\" said Xu Yanchun, 17, from Nantou High School in Shenzhen, who totally agreed with the recent finding. \"Also, friends always help each other.

It seems, however, that this is no longer the definition of friend\", said Meghan Daum, who works with The Los Angeles Times in the US.\nDaum dislikes the idea that quantity _ quality in the age of Friendaholism. She thought the idea of friendship, at least among the growing population of Internet social networkers, was to get as many of not-really-friends as possible. For example, a friend might be someone you might know personally but who could just as easily be the friend of a friend of some other Facebook friend you don't actually know. Although she agreed that social ties grease   the wheels of life, she also warned. \"Too bad one thing money can't buy is a real friend.\"", "id": "high9003.txt"}
