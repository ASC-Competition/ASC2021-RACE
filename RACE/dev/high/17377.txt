Some people say it is just a waste. However, I don't agree. Sometimes, I think there are too many on TV, but sometimes I like to watch just the advertisements . I think they are so funny. I like to watch them when I am bored. Another reason why I like advertisements is I like Internet games. Some Internet games are free because of the advertisements.\n  Inna Ignatovich from Russia: Advertising is an important part of marketing. You can't escape it. Sometimes it bothers me a lot.

Sometimes commercials are very useful; they can inform you on a new product which you wouldn't know about otherwise. However, I think that we are bombarded with too many advertisements, especially on TV. When you want to watch a movie, you are interrupted every five minutes. It is so boring.
