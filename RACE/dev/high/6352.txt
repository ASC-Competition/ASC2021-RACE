I'm  trapped!\" coming from the balcony off Lubeck's bedroom.\n\"I ran in and yelled, 'Don, where are you ?'Then I had to run outside to catch my breath.\"\nAfter one more attempt inside the house, he gave up and circled around back.But there was no way to get to him.\"I shined the flashlight into the woods next to an old shed and noticed a adder,\" says Wentworth.He dragged it over to the balcony and pulled Lubeck down just as the second floor of the house collapsed.\nWentworth and Lubeck don't run into each other regularly, but Lubeck now knows that if he ever needs help ,Wentworth will be there.\nLubeck still chokes up when he tells the story.\"I was alone,\"he says.\"Then I heard the most beautiful sound in my life.It was Jeremie.\"", "id": "high6352.txt"}
