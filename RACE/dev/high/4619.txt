Decades ago, Kodak predicted that digital photography would overtake film   -- and in fact, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision, the company chose to shelf its new discovery to focus on its traditional film business.\n\"It wasn't that Kodak was blind to the future\", said Rebecca Henderson, a professor at Harvard Business School, but rather that it failed to execute on a strategy to confront it. By the time the company realized its mistake, it was too late.\nKodak is an example of a firm that was very much aware that they had to adapt, and spent a lot of money trying to do so, but ultimately failed. Large companies have a difficult time switching into new markets because there is a temptation to put existing assets   into the new businesses.\nAlthough Kodak predicted the unavoidable rise of digital photography, its corporate   culture was too rooted in the successes of the past for it to make the clean break necessary to fully embrace the future. They were a company stuck in time. Their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability.\nKodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. In 1976, the company commanded 90% of the market for photographic film and 85% of the market for cameras. But the 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which undermined Kodak by offering lower prices for film and photo supplies. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major miscalculation. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited its sponsorship to win a permanent foothold in the marketplace.", "id": "high4619.txt"}
