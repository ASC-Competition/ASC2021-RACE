Everyone gave it their all.\nAnd I hate admitting it, but I was an exception. I did not do my best. Not for the ribbon exercise, nor for the club exercise. Knowing that I could have reached a little further to catch my ribbon, focused a little more so the stick wouldn't slip through my fingers, tried a little harder to clean up those errors, but I didn't, still bothers me.\nAfter my disappointing competition, I tried my best to keep my eyes dry. But soon tears burned the edges of my eyes, and as I blinked, the first tear rolled down my cheek. Even though I angrily wiped my tears away before she looked at me, the evidence of my self-pity session presented itself clearly in the form of dirty makeup and reddened eyes.\nMy mom hated to see me cry, especially because I had no right or reason to. I had messed up--that wasn't anyone's fault but mine--and crying wouldn't help at all. \"Why are you crying, Amanda?\" she asked, perhaps more pointedly   than intended, but I heard the concern in her voice. Unable to form all the emotions into words, I just looked away and avoided her questions.\n\"Tell me now why you're crying.\" Her voice this time wasn't as gentle as it was before; it was filled with frustration and impatience. \"Why are you crying?\" she whispered again, but this time her voice was shaky and flooded with pain. This was the first time I'd ever seen my mom cry; my mom, who was always so strong and was there to encourage me through the roughest times, was now crying, and I was the reason for it. Finding my voice, I tentatively asked, \"Why are you crying?\"\nShe looked at me and answered exactly what I was afraid to hear, \"I hate to see you hurting yourself.\" So it was my fault. I had put those tears in her eyes. I had filled her with pain, with helplessness and with sadness.\nI'll never forget her pained expression. It forced me to realize how shortsighted and close-minded I'd been. I decided that no matter what happens in the future, I will never lose myself to regret.", "id": "high8508.txt"}
