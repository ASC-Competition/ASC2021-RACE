The animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which said it received details on the shark's death from two whistleblowers\n , criticized the AHA in a letter over the shark's death.\n\"Sharks are sensitive animals who, in captivity , require a highly specialized and controlled environment,\" the PETA letter read. \"Given the delicate nature of this species, why would the AHA approve the transport and use of this animal?\"\nThe shark was placed into a 227- liter outdoor tank in the Van Nuys suburb of Los Angeles, said Karen Rosa, a senior adviser of the AHA. She added that was a good amount of water for it. \"We honestly don't know why the animal died. It was not being mistreated. It was not being harmed,\" Rosa said.\nEarly in the day, the shark seemed to be in good condition, but at one point they noticed it showed signs of distress. \"As far as I know, it was immediately insisted upon that the animal receive specialized aquatic veterinarian  care,\" she said.\nOxygen was pumped into the tank and the shark was given a shot to try to stabilize it before it was transferred to an aquatic compound for care, where it died the same day, Rosa said.\nThe shoot was for a Kmart commercial, but a representative for the retailer could not disclose any details.\n\"We take this matter seriously and safety is always our first concern,\" the spokesman for Kmart said in a statement.", "id": "high18156.txt"}
