Author and biology professor Bridge Stutchbury, _ the love-bird belief that birds pair up for life. \"In terms of the top 10 beliefs about birds, the lasting pair bonds that we think about, do occur in some birds, but in most of the little songbirds that we studied, no,\" the professor from York University in Toronto said. The divorce rate among greater flamingos is 99 percent.\nStutchbury's book, The Private Lives of Birds, based on 20 years of research from radio filming and DNA testing shows male Acadian flycatchers fertilize  females far away from their home nests, \" The main discovery is that so many birds do divorce for what humans would describe as selfish reasons,\" Professor Stutchbury said.
