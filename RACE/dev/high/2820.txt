If everyone drives such a little car in the future, there will be less pollution in the air, there will be more parking space in cities, and the streets will be less crowded. The space now for one car of the usual size can hold at least three such little cars.\nThe little cars will cost much less to own and to drive. Driving will be safer, too, as these little cars can go only 65 kilometers an hour.\nThe cars of the future will be fine for going around the city, but they will not be useful for going far away. If the car is powered by electricity, it will have two batteries--one battery for the motor and the other for the horn  , signals  , etc. Little cars which are powered by gas will go 45 kilometers before needing to stop for more gas.\nIf big cars are still used along with the small ones, two sets of roads will be needed to set up in the future. Some roads will be used for the big, fast cars, and other roads will be needed for the small, slower ones.", "id": "high2820.txt"}
