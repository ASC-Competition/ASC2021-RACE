My father and I were at a grocery store, and I asked, \"What are all the flags doing here?\" He said, \"We are having the Olympic Games. That's where they honor the greatest athletes in the world.\" I said, \"Papa, someday I'm going to be an Olympic champ.\"\nWalking up the 10-meter platform, I thought to myself, \"I've waited 16 years for this moment. Am I going to win?\" So I prayed to God that I was most deserving of winning the Games.\nDAVID BOND, 90, BRITAIN\nGOLD, SAILING\nDuring the war, I spent six years in Royal Air Force. I think in general, the 1948 Olympics meant very little to most people. We were too busy after the war to be worried about sport very much anyway.\nOur team had about six weeks before the Olympics down at Torquay and we went out sailing every day.\nWinning gold was quite something. It was nice to stand on the platform with lots of people cheering. We celebrated by going to a big dance.\nMICHAEL LAPAGE, 88, BRITAIN\nSILVER, ROWING\nI started rowing when I was 14. I joined the navy in 1942. In 1945 the war came to an end and I started rowing again.\nIn 1948 we were still on rations  : 4 oz. of red meat a week. But the United States had all the meat they wanted. They were the favorites to win.\nOn the day of the final, we led the Americans at the start, but their stronger staying power took them through to win. There were no ribbons on the medals, so we just showed them round the family.\nTHOMAS GODWIN, 91, BRITAIN\nBRONZE, CYCLING\nAt 14 I left school and got a job delivering groceries on a bicycle, which excited my interest in cycling. When the war broke out, I volunteered but was held back, so I continued riding.\nAfter my team won our bronze medals, we went home just round the corner and had a sit-down and a chat and a laugh. It was a different world. Money was never, never thought about.", "id": "high3144.txt"}
