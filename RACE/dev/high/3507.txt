Back then,racing around the playground or skipping rope for hours,you weren't thinking fitness,you were thinking entertainment.But in this age of high-tech home equipment and underused gym memberships,the simple joy of jumping rope has been forgotten.Rediscovering it will give you a total-body exercise you can find.\nAlthough considered an excellent form of exercise,jumping rope has never gained widespread acceptance because of two fundamental reasons.First,most people recognize jumping rope as an excellent form of cardiovascular   exercise,but they also believe that it is simply too difficult.In other words,they don't think they'll be able to continue jumping for the near 20 minutes that it takes to achieve a beneficial physical result.Second, many view it as somewhat boring and too repetitive-not as something fun or enjoyable.\nAs a matter of fact,jumping rope can be great fun if you find a proper way to practise it.Instead of doing the usual two-foot bounce over and over again,people good at rope-jumping often change their pattern every 10 or 20 jumps.A single bounce,a double bounce,a skip,a knee-up,side swings,as well as a variety of other easy-to-learn free-style rope-jumping.\nNow researchers are learning that jumping rope also prepares the brain for learning.It is an exercise allowing both brain hemispheres to perform in parallel to each other.In short,jumping rope can be a life-long activity requiring little equipment,time and space,yet leading to a much healthier life.", "id": "high3507.txt"}
