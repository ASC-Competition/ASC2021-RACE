It seems like sharks are attacking all the time .But that is something of an illusion. The number of attacks is very small.\nHow does a shark hunt? Muscles and fins  give the shark its speed and maneuverability in the water. A shark's front fins act like the wings of a plane and let it \"fly\" through the water. The tail acts like a high-power propeller .\nBut the big thing that gives the shark its edge in the ocean is its sensory package. The package includes the shark' eyes ,ears ,skin, nose and mouth, as well as electric sensing.\nA shark' nose is probably its most important sense.  If you were to put a single drop of blood in a swimming pool ,a great white shark could smell that. And they can tell the direction that the smell is coming from.\nSharks handle their electric sensing using cell located in the head .Whenever something moves using its muscles , a shark can detect the electrical impulses flowing to those muscles. A shark can electrically \"see\" anything that has muscles even if it is hiding or the water is not clear.\nSharks even have vibration sensors in their skin. Even something moves near  the shark ,tubes pick up the pressure changes and hairs inside the tubes send signals to the brain . This extra sense allows a shark to turn quickly and attack again.\nWhen you put all these different senses together ,it makes the shark a nearly ideal hunter. A shark can detect prey from miles away and then use eyes ,electrosensing and movement sensing to home in .\nStrangely, sharks do not seem to use these senses to\npeople. The very low number of sharks tells us that sharks do not hunt people on a regular basis. On the other hand , people love to hunt sharks. Millions of sharks die every year. Without protection ,extinction is a definite possibility.", "id": "high15943.txt"}
