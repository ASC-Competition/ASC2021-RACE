At the end of the trial the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was crazy.But the judge said that the lawyer held a policy   from the company in which it had promised that the cigars were insured and that it would insure them against fire.Because the company didn't say what is considered to be unacceptable fire, it had to pay the claim.\nRather than put up with long and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the punishment and paid $ 15 ,000 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the \"fires.\"\nAfter the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested and accused him of arson  .With his own insurance claim from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was charged with burning his insured possessions on purpose and was sentenced to 24 months in prison and a $ 24,000 fine.", "id": "high11671.txt"}
