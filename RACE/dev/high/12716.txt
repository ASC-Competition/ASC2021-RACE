Add two pieces of advanced 21stcentury technology -- global positioning system (GPS) devices and the Internet -- to get \"geocaching\".\nThe word geocaching comes from \"geo\" (earth) and \"cache\" (hidden storage). Geocachers log onto a website to find information about the location of a cache -- usually a waterproof plastic box containing small items such as toys and CDs -- along with a notebook where \"finders\" can enter comments and learn about the cache \"owner\", the person who created and hid the cache. Finders may take any of the items in the cache but are expected to replace them with something of similar value. They then visit the website again and write a message to the owner.\nGeocaching became possible on May 1, 2000, when a satellite system developed by the U.S. Department of Defense was made public. Using an inexpensive GPS device, anyone on earth can send a signal to the satellites and receive information about their position. This is basically a high-tech version of orienteering, the traditional pastime which uses maps and compasses instead of GPS to determine one's location.\nGeocachers are a very considerate group. Owners carefully choose a cache's location to give finders an enjoyable experience, such as a beautiful view or a good campsite. They also consider the environmental impact of their cache since it could result in an increased number of visitors to an area. As for the content of the caches, owners and finders must only use items that are suitable for the whole family, as caches are found by geocachers of all ages.", "id": "high12716.txt"}
