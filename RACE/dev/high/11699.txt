My family are now in Sacramento, California. We are here paying a visit to visit to my aunt Gloria. We have been to the California State Capital Building, the nature center, and the zoo. I have seen many interesting things, but one stands out above the rest. This morning we drove from my aunt's home to Calistoga to see California's Old Faithful Geyser . I had read about it in my book, Sightseeing in California; Where You Should Go.You have probably heard of Old Faithful, the geyser father north in Yellowstone National Park. This California geyser is sometimes called\" Little Old Faithful.\"\nWhen we arrived California's Old Faithful was only a calm pool of water. The geyser didn't look very deep. \" What's the big deal?\" I wondered. As I turned, I saw some steam rising from the water. Before I knew it, there was hot water shooting up about 60 feet into the air. We could not believe our eyes! It continued for almost three minutes.\nAunt Gloria told me that the water came from an underground river. She also said that the water temperature was about 95degC. This water can sometimes shoot 170 feet into the air.\nMy aunt said that other geysers around the world reach hotter temperatures and shoot water even higher than California's Old Faithful Geyser. I'd love to learn more about this geyser and other geysers in different countries when I get home. I'll see you soon!\nYour friend,\nBennetto", "id": "high11699.txt"}
