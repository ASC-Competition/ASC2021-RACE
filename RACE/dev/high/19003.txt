In 1988 , when The World light-heartedly ranked 50 countries according to where would be the best place to be born in 1988 , America indeed came top . But which country will be the best for a baby born in 2015 ?\nTo answer this , the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) , has this time turned deadly serious . It attempts to measure which country will provide the best opportunities for a healthy , safe and prosperous life in the years ahead . Its quality-of-life index links the results of subjective life-satisfaction surveys - how happy people say they are - to objective determinants of the quality of life . Being rich helps more than anything else , but it is not all that counts ; things like crime , trust in public institutions and the health of family life matter too . In all , the index takes 11 significant factors into account .\nDespite the global economic crisis , times have in certain respects never been so good . Output growth rates have been decreasing across the world , but income levels are at or near historic highs , Life expectancy continues to increase steadily and political freedoms have become better known across the globe .\nWhat does all this mean for where a baby might be luckiest to be born in 2015 ? After calculation , the EIU has Switzerland comfortably in the top spot , with Australia second . Small economies occupy the top ten . Half of these are European , but only one , the Netherlands , is from the euro zone . The largest European economies ( Germany , France and Britain ) do not do particularly well . America , where babies will inherit the large debts of the boomer generation , stays in 16th place . Among the 80 countries covered , Nigeria comes last .\nSome people will , of course , find more holes in all this than there are in a big Swiss cheese . For example , in the film \" The Third Man \" , Harry Lime famously says that Italy for 30 years had war , terror and murder under the Borgias but in that time produced Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance ; Switzerland had 500 yeas of peace and democracy -- and produced clocks and watches .\nHowever , there is surely a lot to be said for birth stability in today's uncertain times .", "id": "high19003.txt"}
