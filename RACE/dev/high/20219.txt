Her husband died three years ago and one of her children worked in the capital and the other three lived in another town. Her husband didn't leave her much money and she had to live a simple life. Sometimes her children went to see her during their holidays, ubt they stayed with her for only two or three days.\n    One winter morning the old woman got up early. She was going to buy some food in a shop. And when she came out, she found there was much snow in the street. She had to sweep it away. And suddenly she found a dying dog at the corner of the house. She picked it up and took it into to house quickly. She put it near the fire and gave it some milk and bread. At first the poor dog ate nothing and that afternoon it drank some milk and three days later it was all right. Now the old woman found it was a beautiful dog. And she liked it very much and took it everywhere she went. A week later she went shopping with her dog. At a bus stop a young man was eating fish and chips. The little dog became very excited at the smell of the man's lunch and began jumping up at him.\n\"Do you mind if I throw it a bit ?\" asked the young man.\n\"Not at all,\" answered Mrs. White.\n    Having heard this, he picked up the dog and threw it over the wall.", "id": "high20219.txt"}
