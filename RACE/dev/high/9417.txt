Named last month as one of the government's flagship academies, its students regularly come at or near the top of exam results for the entire country, outperforming such famous names as Eton or Harrow. But unlike those private schools, where fees can exceed PS28, 000 or PS45, 000 a year, Hockerill, in the Hertfordshire town, is a state comprehensive, which charges no tuition fees and is forbidden from selecting its students on the basis of academic ability. And while a third of Hockerill's 830 students are boarders, they are chosen on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.\nSo when the school's principal heard of government plans to raise university tuition fees in England to PS9, 000 a year, he decided to make use of the school's international focus. urging his students to apply to universities abroad and hiring a counselor  to help the students who want to apply to universities in countries whose fees are cheaper. \"If you can get into a university in France and pay about PS180 a year for an education at one of the best institutions in the world, why would you pay PS9, 000 a year in Britain?\" the principal asked.\nPupils at Hockerill are offered a choice of seven foreign languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese or Mandarin. History and geography classes are taught exclusively in French or German. But with English rapidly becoming the international language of education, even less linguistically flexible students soon find that going abroad can save them money while enhancing the quality of their education.\n\"Our students can get to Maastricht in Holland by train more quickly than they can get to Lees from London,\" the principal said. Just over the border from Germany and Belgium, Maastricht University offers a highly regarded undergraduate program taught in English. Tuition fees are about PS1, 430, a year. Germany and France offer even greater savings.", "id": "high9417.txt"}
