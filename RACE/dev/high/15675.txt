It has little to do with the usual challenges, such as flood, rising fuel prices and crop-eating insects. The country's farmers are getting older, and there are fewer people standing in line to take their place. National agricultural census   figures show that the fastest-growing group of farmers is the part over 65. Merrigan is afraid the average age will be even higher when the 2012 statistics are completed.\nMerrigan, a former college professor, is making stops at universities across the country in hopes of encouraging more students to think about careers in agriculture. Aside from trying to stop the graying of America's farmers, her work is made tougher by a recent blog posting that put agriculture at No. 1 on a list of \"useless\" college degrees. Top federal agriculture officials are talking about the posting, and it has the attention of agricultural organizations across the country.\n\"There couldn't be anything that's more incorrect,\" Merrigan said. \"We know that there aren't enough qualified graduates to fill the jobs that are out there in American agriculture.\"\nIn addition, a growing world population that some experts predict will require 70% more food production by 2050, she said.\n\"I truly believe we're at a golden age of agriculture.

The National Young Farmers' Coalition has also been pushing for state and federal policy changes to make it easier for new farmers.\nRyan Best, president of Future Farmers of America, has been living out of a suitcase, traveling the country and visiting with high school students about careers in agriculture. The 21-year-old Best hopes his message --that this is a new time in agriculture-- will motivate the next generation\n. \"Never before have we had the innovations   in technology which have led to agriculture in this country being the most efficient it has ever been,\" he said. \"There's really a place for everybody to fit in. \"", "id": "high15675.txt"}
