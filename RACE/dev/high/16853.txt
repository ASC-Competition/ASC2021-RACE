Performance in mathematics and science.The contest is open to any student who is an American citizen or permitted to live in the United States The Siemens Foundation joined the College Board and six universities to create the competition.More than 1,600 students took part in the contest last year.\n    Experts from the universities judge competitions in six parts of the country.Individual and team winners from those events then compete nationally.They demonstrate their projects to university professors and scientists.A winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics,Joseph Taylor,led the judging group for the latest contest.\n    The results from that judging group produced a first in the history of the competition It was the first time in which girls won both the individual and the team prizes.Forty-eight percent of those who entered the latest contest were young women.\n    The individual winner was Isha Jain of Bethlehem,Pennsylvania.She received 100,000 dollars toward her college education for her studies of bone growth in zebra fish.The Siemens judges said she was the first to discover that bone grows in many short periods of time.They also said her work was equal to that of a student who had completed four years of college.\n    The top team winners were two seventeen year olds from Plainview,New York.Janelle Schloss berger and Amanda Harin off shared a prize of 100,000 dollars for their college educations.The young women studied bacteria responsible for the disease tuberculosis(,TB).They created substances that kill tuberculosis by attacking a protein.The Siemens\n Foundation says their discovery could lead to a new treatment for drug resistant TB.", "id": "high16853.txt"}
