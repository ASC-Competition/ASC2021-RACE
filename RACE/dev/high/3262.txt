It has game nights and student dances, after-school activities, and sports teams. However, students at the school must earn the right to join in the fun. If they don't do their homework, participate in class, and behave at all times, they're banned  from participating in after-school activities.\nStudents and parents say the threat of being excluded  appears to be working. Kenny T. of Reno, Nev., says it taught him that actions have consequences: \"I learned that I need to be balanced in both my work and athletics to be rewarded for working hard.\" Parent Sondra LaMacchia told The New York Times that her 14-year-old daughter is learning responsibility at Cheektowaga Central. The teen used to perform poorly in her studies, but then she was banned from a school dance. The message got through loud and clear. \"It's nobody's fault but hers,\" LaMacchia said.\nAlthough exclusion may help teach responsibility, some psychologists say it can also be threatening, especially for students who often cause, or may cause, trouble in school. They might become more aggressive and antisocial, which is exactly what schools like Cheektowaga Central want to prevent.\nShould schools exclude students from activities to get them to behave? I believe teens need school activities and that inclusion can be the answer. For some troubled students, activities can be their motivation to stay in school. \"Activities such as sports may be the only thing keeping certain students in school,\" says Duace Wood, a teacher at Mohonasen High School in Rotterdam, N.Y. Getting involved in after-class activities keeps troublesome students in class. Even if they don't do as well as their classmates, they are still learning. The more time they spend at school, the less time they have to even think about starting trouble. Teams also provide support and role models, and they help build the confidence that students need to succeed. If students who don't behave are banned from activities, they might give up on school altogether.", "id": "high3262.txt"}
