I was offered a job that looked interesting in a part of the world I'd never been to before. I'd also long had an interest in Africa, so I decided it was time to find out the reality.\nA small amount of research showed that in more than 40 years since gaining independence, Cameroon has been a peaceful country with no wars. Not only are there no wars, but Cameroon is a food exporter to the region.\nNow, after three years, I can say that these have been the healthiest years of my life! No malaria or any of the other frightening diseases you read about when Africa is mentioned. The worst thing that ever happened to me was a bout of food poisoning -- once.\nSo what is it like to teach here? Well surprisingly not so different from teaching anywhere else.\nMost students come to us with a bit of English in their heads. Cameroon is a bilingual country with French and English as official languages, while there are also close to 200 local ethnic languages in a country of 16 million people. French is the _ language, spoken by about 80% of the population.\nThe local school system is very traditional and somewhat strict. Perhaps not surprisingly when there can be up to 150 students in the classroom (of which maybe 30 have the books, and there are probably seats for 70).\nLike anywhere else, students appreciate it if you know a bit about their country, and not just Roger Milla (the top scorer of the 1990 World Cup, in case you're wondering). It helps if you know the names of the ten provinces, know who the first president was, or can say a word in a local language.\nSo in conclusion: Cameroon isn't just football. Not is it war, poverty and disease. It's just life and people, like anywhere else.", "id": "high4656.txt"}
