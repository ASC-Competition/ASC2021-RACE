As the phrase goes, sometimes you do have to \"stop and smell the roses\".\nAlthough you may think that this is just a fancy way of saying taking some time to enjoy life, perhaps we have dismissed roses for too long. Seriously, you should pay more attention to those roses. They could greatly improve your life. That is, if you are one of the millions of people in the US who suffer from arthritis diseases.\nResult from two different arthritis studies have proved that an active ingredient of rose hips has been shown to protect and possibly rebuild joint tissue broken down by arthritis. The latest results, presented at the World Conference in Rome showed that protein GOPO(R) found in rose hips can protect vulnerable cartilage . GOPO(R) has also been shown to improve mood, increase energy and sleep quality of those affected by arthritis. Marked by stiffness, swelling, loss of flexibly and pain, arthritis can significantly stop one from a normal life.\n\"We have little doubt that certain rose hip preparations, and GOPO(R) in particular, have had an important role to play in reducing the pain and disability caused by arthritis,\" said Winther.\nWith the aid of this new research, those affected by joint pain caused by arthritis could choose an alternative treatment than pain killers. \"We suspect that more people will be turning to the power of rose-hip for joint pain relief,\" said Winther.\nSorry Shakespeare, but in this case, no other rose could smell as sweet.", "id": "high19244.txt"}
