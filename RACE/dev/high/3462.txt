The sun heats up lakes, oceans, and other wet places on Earth. When the water gets warm enough, it changes into vapour. Plants also give off lots of water vapour. Some of this water vapour cools off high in the sky and becomes clouds. Then it falls back to Earth in a new place as rain or snow. This cycle happens over and over again.\nThe ground can absorb water like a sponge  . If you could see this groundwater, it wouldn't look like a lake or river. The groundwater is mixed in with the rocks and sand that lie in layers  below Earth's surface.\nGroundwater moves along slowly. How slowly? Maybe 1.5 kilometres in one century. Some of this water has been underground for thousands of years. And once groundwater is pumpedout of the ground from a deep well  by people, it may take hundreds of years for another water to take its place.", "id": "high3462.txt"}
