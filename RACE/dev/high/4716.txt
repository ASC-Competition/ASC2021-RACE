It has a studio where he likes to paint. Tony plans to have his first exhibition later in the year and he has already sold one picture for $4000. At the end of the year Tony is to star in a musical film , which has been specially written for him called \"Two Bits\", an informal expression for 50 cents.

He always wanted me to sing, but he never lived long enough to be a part of my success.", "id": "high4716.txt"}
