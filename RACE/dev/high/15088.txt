Some social workers,the ones who clear up the worms,think we're in danger of carrying this idea of personal freedom to the point where serious risks are being taken with the health and safety of the old.\nIndeed,the old can be easily hurt or harmed.The old is like a car: it needs more mechanical repair as it gets older.You can carry this comparison right through to provision of spare parts.But never forget that such operations are painful experiences,however good the results are.And at what point should you stop to treat the old body?Is it morally right to try to push off death by continuing the development of medicine to excite the forgetful old mind and to make the old body active,knowing that it is designed to die?You cannot ask doctors or scientists to decide,because so long as they can see the technical chances,they will feel it necessary to give them a try,by the rule that while there's life,there's hope.\nTalking to the old,however,you're forced to the conclusion that whether age is happy or unpleasant depends less on money or health than it does on your ability to have fun.", "id": "high15088.txt"}
