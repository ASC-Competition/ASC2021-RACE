They are very interested in it. Why is it becoming more and more popular now? There are some reasons. First, more and more people have their own computers and their computers can be joined with the Internet. So it is possible for many of them to do shopping through the Internet. Second, shopping through the Internet can save them some money and a lot of time. Third, they don't need to go to the shop themselves.  Because of these good facts, few people refuse it.\nOn the other hand, some people don't like this new way of shopping. They are worried about the safety of shopping online. Customers can only see the pictures of a product on the Internet.  And they can't enjoy the pleasure of buying things in a large supermarket or a wonderful shopping center. These are the reasons why they do not like it.  But I think more and more people will like this new kind of shopping in the future.", "id": "high16645.txt"}
