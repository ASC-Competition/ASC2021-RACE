Helping them enjoy science can be easy; there is no need for a lot of scientific terms or expensive lab equipment. You only have to share your children's curiosity. Firstly, listen to their questions. I once visited a classroom of seven -year- olds to talk about science as a job. The children asked me \"textbook questions\" about schooling, salary and whether I liked my job. When I finished answering, we sat facing one another in science. Finally I said,\" Now that we've finished with your lists, do you have questions of your own about science?\"\nAfter a long pause, a boy raised his hand, \"have you ever seen a grasshopper eat? When I try eating leaves like that, I get a stomachache. Why?\"\nThis began a set of questions that lasted nearly two hours.\nSecondly, give them time to think. Studies over the past 30 years have shown that. After asking a question, adults typically wait only one second or less for an answer, no time for a child to think. When adults increase their \"wait time\" to three seconds or more, children give more logical, complete and creative answers.\nThirdly, watch your language. Once you have a child involved in a science discussion, don't jump in with \"That's right\" or \"very good\". These words work well when it comes to encouraging good behavior. But in talking about science, quick praise can signal that discussion is over. Instead, keep things going by saying, \"That's interesting\" or \"I'd never thought of it that way before', or coming up with more questions or ideas.\nNever push a child to \"think\". It doesn't make sense; children are always thinking, without your telling them to. What's more, this can turn a conversation into a performance. The child will try to find the answer you want, in as few words as possible, so that he will be a small target for your disagreement.\nLastly, show; don't tell. Real-life impressions of nature are far more impressive than any lesson children can learn from a book or a television program. Let children look at their fingertips through a magnifying glass, and they'll understand why you want them to wash before dinner. Rather than saying that water evaporates, set a pot of water to boil and let them watch the water level drop.", "id": "high2298.txt"}
