They kept shaking even when I was asked to jump onto a \" lifeboat.\" Cao recalled.\nUpon receiving the urgent appeal, China Marine Search and Rescue Center immediately informed the State Council .The center sent eight lifeboats to the sinking ship and asked for help form the Ministry of Agriculture, the Navy and nearby fishing boats.\nAfter more than four hours of fighting against strong winds and freezing ocean water, the passengers were recovered.
