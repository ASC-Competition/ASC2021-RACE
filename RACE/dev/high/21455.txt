I classify   them according to how well I know them and how well they know me.\nThe first type of friend is just an acquaintance  .This means that you only know their name. You might not even remember what they look like if you go away for a short vacation. You don't miss them when they are elsewhere. It is also this type of friend who gives you the most amount of aggravation  .Since most of the time you are placed in a position where you have to act friendly. You would not normally tell an acquaintance when he or she is doing something that makes you feel angry,such as tapping the fingers on a table or shouting loudly. I call them \"pest friends\".\nThe second kind of friend is a \"guest friend\".They are just social partners. You meet them at a certain location and at the end of the meeting you go your separate way and they go theirs. You don't talk too often with this sort of friend,and you don't share each other's secrets.\nLastly,we have  \"best friends\".This sort of friend is there when you need them. They know you as a person and they are there through thick and thin. Best friends are the ones that you can lean and depend on no matter what happens. If you need a listening ear,they will be the one to lend support.\nFriends come in all different shapes and sizes. Every friend has an influence on our life....", "id": "high21455.txt"}
