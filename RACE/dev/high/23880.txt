In 1863,a Frenchman called Pierre Lallement attached pedals to the front wheel of a bicycle,and the modern idea of a bicycle was born.\n    Every generation sees new designs and new interest in bicycles.Mountain bikes,for example,transformed the way people thought about cycling and introduced a new sport,which was accepted into the Olympics in 1996.\n    New materials such as titanium and carbon fiber are now used to build strong,lightweight machines and combined brake and gear systems have been developed.Englishman Chris Boardman astonished the world in the 1990s with his carbon fiber Lotus bicycle,winning Olympic gold in the 4,000 meters track pursuit in Barcelona.More recently,the Great Britain team took several medals at the Athens Olympics\n    For most people.however.the bicycle remains what it has always been-a pollution-free way of taking exercise and getting from A to B.", "id": "high23880.txt"}
