Our school is located in the most northern part of Thailand.\nI used to teach according to my plan and in addition I had to take care of students` safety. Early this month(November) we all needed to put on our light jacket to prevent cool weather. One morning during the first break I saw a group of primary level boys were playing police and thief game. They were a playing with a plastic pistol , which can shoot with plastic balls. It seemed to me very dangerous for their eyes. Immediately I called them and ask to hand over their toy gun. I placed it between my back bone and waist belt. No one can see it because it is under my light jacket.\nIn the afternoon I needed to pay my house electric bill and I had to _ some money from Kung Thai Bank. I walked into the bank and sat in waiting chair with other customers. I relaxed my back to the seat and then I realized that toy gun in my body. Oh, God! I made a big mistake because it is gun forbidden area. I looked around and my eyes met with the guard's eyes.\nI became sweating and couldn`t move from my seat until my turn announced from public addresser. As soon as I received my money and I shouted without voice \" I will never make the same mistake again\". The following period before I taught my lesson to class I told them what happened to me today. All my students enjoyed laughing without end.", "id": "high7218.txt"}
