How do you decide on a school when there are thousands of them to pick from? Start by asking yourself questions about your preferences:\nWhat are my strengths?\n1.Am I interested in liberal arts or science or business?\n2.What kind of learning environment is best for me?\n3.Would I be more comfortable in a small school or a large one?\n4.Do I want to stay close to home or live far away?\n5.Would I prefer to be in a city environment or a small college town?\n6.Do I like being with people who are mostly like me or do I want to meet a different group?\nAsk friends and older people who are in college about their schools and about other schools they're familiar with. Talk to one of your teachers and go to college fairs when they visit your town.\nOnce you've narrowed down your choices, ask the schools to send you related materials and visit their websites. When you've cut your list down to a manageable number, make arrangements to visit. Try to do this when the schools are having regular classes, so you can get a good idea of what life is really like on campus.\nAnd remember: you're not the only one making a decision. Schools are picking from a large pool of students. They want to know how excellent you are and what makes you stand out from everyone else. They will look at your school performance, test scores, and so on, so it's important to devote time and effort to all these things.", "id": "high7639.txt"}
