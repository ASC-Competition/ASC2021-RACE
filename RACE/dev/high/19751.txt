What are the causes of this phenomenon and what problems has it brought to families and society as a whole?\nIn this day and age, the human society is progressing rapidly on various aspects. Many modern technologies were invented by human such as cars, computers and Internet. But advances in technology lead to our pace of life much faster than before. People have not enough time with their family.\nIt is evident that the causes of this phenomenon are different. In the first place, advancing in technology improves the efficiency of production, but also causes people to do more things at the same time. Moreover, this is especially true when we consider the fact that the global financial crisis in recent years has led many people to fear losing their job, and the significant rising costs of life which need people to work harder than before. Besides, employees may be scattered at the whole world. For example, my friend often holds a meeting at middle-night with his colleague who stays in the US and he still needs to work at daytime.\nIn my opinion, the impact of this phenomenon on families and society is profound. People do not have enough time to spend with their family, especially with their children. They may spend much time in front of TV or computer games which have much violence and may seriously influence children's growth. Furthermore, the increasingly over-speed lifestyle will engender a higher incidence of illness. More instances about employee's sudden death at his/her workplace are reported by media and we must make reflection.\nIn brief, I pen down saying that people should spend more time with their family because families are the foundation of the society. This is no longer a problem for individual families, but for society as a whole.", "id": "high19751.txt"}
