He bit a female zookeeper before being caught. The 24-year-old gorilla came out of his living quarters through an unlocked door on Monday morning. He ran into the space which was used by zoo workers but closed to the public.\nA keeper who has cared for Koga since he arrived in 2007 was bitten on her hand and leg. Zoo officials said it was an act of excitement. \"He was probably just as surprised coming face to face with her as she was with him,\" Buffalo Zoo President Donna Fernandes said.\nThe keeper took refuge   inside the habitat of a female gorilla and her newborn baby. The keeper's decision to lock herself inside the separate habitat likely kept her from being further harmed. The keeper had a good relationship with the mother who, like Koga, is a west lowland gorilla, native to West Africa and the Congo River Basin, according to Fernandes.\nSeveral locked doors prevented Koga from running wildly through the zoo and beyond. The police sent in a team to make sure the area was safe while a vet   used a pipe to sedate (......) Koga. The gorilla was dragged by the zoo staff back to his cage once the drugs took hold.\nVisitors to the zoo were moved indoors and stayed there for about 45 minutes while the team was trying to catch the gorilla and send it back to his cage. \"That was the scariest thing I've ever done in my career,\" said the team's captain Mark Maraschiello. \"It's a 400-pound gorilla. Nobody knew what harm he could do to us. He could have bitten my arm off easily,\" Maraschiello added.", "id": "high8395.txt"}
