Her name is Paula so we call her Miss Paula.\nThe first time we met her she said we are going to be good friends and that good friends are always nice to each other.\nMiss Paula has been teaching us a lot of things. Some of us used to get in trouble for talking in the hallway. Miss Paula says she can't change the rule that we can't make noise in the hallway but we can still talk to each other. She is teaching us sign language. I already know how to say \"hello\" and \"how are you\" with my hands. Now we love it when we have to walk somewhere and we are always quiet except for a laugh or two.\nMiss Paula likes everybody even Sam and nobody likes Sam. He never does what he's told but now he is doing better. Miss Paula says every single one of us is perfect and beautiful just the way we are. I guess that includes Sam.\nThis week at school was really the best ever. I didn't even get in trouble when I thought I would, because I spilled   milk on my homework and had to hand it in when it was still wet. Miss Paula just smiled and asked, \"What's this?\" So I told her what happened. Miss Paula put it near the window to make it dry. She said the sun had been waiting for such an important job as this and would be happy to help us.\nWell, I have to go and get ready for bed now. I have school in the morning and I want to wake up early so I will have time to pick Miss Paula some flowers.", "id": "high16880.txt"}
