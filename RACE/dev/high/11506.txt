They are also more likely to use the Internet to download music and software and to take a class.\nOnline women, meanwhile, are bigger users of e-mail, and they are also more likely to go online for religious information and support for health or personal problems.\n\"For men, it's just, 'give me the facts,'\" said Deborah Fallows, who wrote the report based on six years of Pew surveys, \"For women, its 'Let's talk about this. Are you worried about this problem?' It's keeping in touch and connecting with people in a richer way.\"\nAbout two- thirds of the 6,403 adults surveyed by Pew during 2005 said they use the Internet. By gender, it was 68%of the male respondents, and 66%of the female participants---a statistically insignificant difference given the study's margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2%points. In 2002, by contrast, the gap was slightly larger: 61%vs. 57%.\nThe surveys find that for many activities, such as getting travel information or looking up a phone number, men and women are equally likely to use the Internet.", "id": "high11506.txt"}
