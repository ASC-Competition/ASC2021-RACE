Consider using one address for personal e-mails and a different one for formal use.\nUpper case \n         Take care also NOT TO TYPE UNNECESSARILY IN UPPER CASE, as this is the e-mail version of shouting.\nPersonal information\n         You should  _ too about giving away too much personal information over the Internet.It may feel much more comfortable to \"talk\" using instant messages as there are no uncomfortable silences or awkward moments, but never forget that--unless the person you are speaking to is a friend or family member--you really know nothing about them, so be careful.Further to this, NEVER agree to meet a stranger that you have spoken to online, as it can be extremely dangerous.\nMy final message though is--have fun! The Internet is exciting, useful and informative.But, as with so many things that we believe we can't live without, it is a much better servant than a master.", "id": "high21774.txt"}
