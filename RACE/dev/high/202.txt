If you have to make a decision of this type, most people (especially very busy people) will choose to skip breakfast.\nHowever, many experts in the field of health consider breakfast ( the meal which \"break\" you \"fast\" ) to be the most important t meal of the day. If we eat a good breakfast, they say, we will have the energy and nutrients   we need to begin our working day with vigor  and stay hopeful with good honor. However, many people skip breakfast or _ .

Participants included both males and females who ranged in age from 12 to 83. The results showed that if a person eats an adequate breakfast, he or she will work more efficiently and more productively than if he or she skips breakfast or eats a very poor breakfast. This fact appears to be especially true if a person's work involves mental  activities. The study showed that if school-children eat fruit, eggs, bread and milk before going to school, they will learn more quickly and will be able to concentrate  on their lessons for a longer period of time than if their breakfast is inadequate.\nThe study also showed that contrary to what people believe, if you skip breakfast, you will not lose weight.

So remember, if you want to lose weight, skipping breakfast will not help you. You will likely lose more weight if you decrease your other meals.", "id": "high202.txt"}
