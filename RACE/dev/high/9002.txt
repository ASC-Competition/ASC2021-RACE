The European project now stands in a bad reputation across much of Europe.\"\nThe only European leader rated highly by their own voters was the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with 74 percent voters in favor of her.\nPrime Minister David Cameron was the next highest with a positive score of 37 percent among the British public, although he can take some comfort from the fact that 58 percent of Poles and half of all French people think he is doing a good job.\nIn spite of the dark economic future and growing doubt of the EU, there were strong majorities of more than 60 percent in favor of keeping the euro in the five countries surveyed that use the single currency.", "id": "high9002.txt"}
