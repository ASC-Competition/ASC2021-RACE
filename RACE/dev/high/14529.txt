But using ambergris, which helps a perfume last longer, is strongly opposed by many people who think it is wrong to kill whales just so we can smell sweet. Joerg Bohlmann is neither a perfumer nor a whale expert. He's a plant biologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. But his discovery of a new plant gene   might push whales out of the perfume business.\nThe gene comes from fir trees, found throughout North America and commonly used as Christmas trees. The trees produce a chemical that can be used in perfume in place of ambergris-but _ . \"There's a problem that many people wouldn't consider. In the tree, the chemical is mixed with many others. That makes separation a challenge,\" Bohlmann says. \"lt's like trying to isolate sugar from a biscuit. \"\nThis is where science becomes useful. When Bohlmann learned that fir trees produce the ambergris-like chemical, he decided to use his gene know-how to find the instructions for how to make the ambergris-substitute.\nBohlmann found that gene and took it out of the tree cells. Then he did something that might sound strange to someone who doesn't work in genetics: Bohlmann put the gene from the tree into yeast   cells.\nYeast may sound familiar because it's used to make things like bread, wine and beer. Biologists like to work with yeast because it easily adopts new genes and changes its features and behaviour. When Bohlmann put the fir tree gene into the yeast, the yeast started making the same chemical that had been produced by the tree.\nPerfumers pay big money for ambergris because it is a fixative, which means it holds a smell in place on a person's body.\n\"Cheap perfumes smell good in the first hour or so and then everything is gone,\" explains Bohlmann. \"But expensive perfumes are much more stable.  Their smell lasts much longer, for hours or even a day after you apply them. \"\nThe new chemical, made from the tree genes, can be used as a fixative, too. And using yeast to make it is far cheaper than acquiring ambergris.\nBohlmann admits he never thought he'd get into the perfume business. But now, he says, producers have been calling to find out how to use his technology in new perfumes.", "id": "high14529.txt"}
