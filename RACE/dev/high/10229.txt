A panda can eat up to 40kg of bamboo per day.\nPaleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon, the US co-author at the University of lowa, said the panda's focus on bamboo could have helped it survive all these years.\n\"Once an animal begins to rely on a common and stable food source, such as bamboo, it tends to evolve a larger body size,\" he said. \"As individuals of the evolving species grow bigger, they have a better chance not to be eaten by predators   due to their larger body size.\"", "id": "high10229.txt"}
