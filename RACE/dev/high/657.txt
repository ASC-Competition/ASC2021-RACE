In another way, failure may be a way towards success. The \"spider story\" is often told. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the English. He watched a spider spinning a web . The spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. He tried six times without success. On the seventh time he _ and went on to spin his web. Bruce is said to have taken heart and to have gone on to defeat the English... Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one.\nSo what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it?

Learn to \"live with yourself\" even though you may have failed. Remember, \"You can't win them all.\"", "id": "high657.txt"}
