This could be Mary Moe's motto--the expression that best presents her spirit. Mary Moe has done a lot during the past 91 years. For much of that time, she wanted to fly, but never had the chance--until now. She recently achieved her life-long dream.\nMary just learned how to fly an airplane, a dream she has had since she was a little girl. Growing up, she was inspired by two American pilots: Charles Lindburgh Amelia Earhart. They became her inspiration. Lindbugh made the solo nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. Five years later, Earhart became the first woman to make the flight. But Mary Moe could not find time to make her dream come true. At age 34, she was just too busy--busy fighting cancer. She was also busy with her job in advertising and busy raising her family.\nThere was simply no time to think about flying a plane. And it was difficult for her to drive to the airport. Lessons were costly. Everything seemed to be working against Mary.\n\"I had actually gone out to that airport in the 1980s to see about flying lessons and it was such a long drive out and expensive and I thought, 'No, I have to _ for a while.'\" So her dream had to wait. She kept it on the back burner. Then, at age 91, her wish finally came true.\nMs Moe learned about Wish of a lifetime. Wish of a Lifetime is a non-profit organization whose goal is to change the way our society thinks about aging and older adults.\nSally Webster works for the group. Wish of Lifetime helps older people, senior citizens, enjoy a dream. It also sends the message that it is never too late for a dream. So they really try to look for those stories that are inspiring and can show people that older Americans can achieve things just like younger Americans can.", "id": "high12617.txt"}
