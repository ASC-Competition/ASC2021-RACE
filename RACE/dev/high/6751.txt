While I am not a nurse, and have never given anyone a bath, I would imagine that it would take a lot of sympathy   and patience to do so.\nYet those who attended the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems last month were introduced to Cody, a robot that can bathe human beings.\nThe robot has a base that can be turned to all directions, two humanlike arms, and movable wrists  . It uses a camera to locate parts of the human body.  It then uses bath gloves to clean with a little pressure.\nThe robot was designed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Charles Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab is the senior researcher for the project. In a test run, Cody   was able to remove 96% of a test subject's dirt--not bad  for a robot.\nBut don't go asking for Cody yet--he's still a model.  Yet researchers believe that one day Cody may take the  place of nurses for this task.  Researchers say that Cody  will give patients dignity and protect their personal information. I suppose that would depend on the patient.  I'm  not sure whether a robot using a camera would make me  feel very dignified.\nEven so, I can appreciate the need.  We don't have  enough nurses to go around, and those places that are the  most shorthanded, for example, nursing homes, are those  that have the most patients who are unable to bathe themselves. Still, before I get there, I hope they think of a better way to solve the problem.", "id": "high6751.txt"}
