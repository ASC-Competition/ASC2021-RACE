His life seems different from that of the others. He looks exhausted and carries nothing. He appears along a downtown street, seemingly out of nowhere. We sometimes want to know where he sleeps at night.\nA few weeks ago he boarded the bus. A few stops later, a young woman boarded. She swiped   her bus-card, only to find the machine would not accept it. The driver told her to pay the $2.25 fare. \"I just bought this card,\" she said. \"I paid the money...\"\nThe driver said she could take the card back to the sales office and explain the problem. In the meantime she would have to pay the fare for that day. The woman became confused and _ . The rest of us just watched, wondering how the problem would be solved. Suddenly the man rose from his seat, dropped a few coins into the fare box.\n\"You're lucky,\" the bus driver said quietly. \"He paid for you.\" Silence fell over the bus. The rest of us had watched the woman's discomfort, but he felt it. We lawyers, journalists and business people headed downtown to help fix the world. He fixed her world.\nI haven't seen him since that day. Some people believe angels occasionally drop down and move among us. All I know is that I have a new respect for the simple act of kindness. It speeds us along on our way.", "id": "high6372.txt"}
