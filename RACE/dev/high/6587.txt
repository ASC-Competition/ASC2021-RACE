It may be the first experience of stress, at this level, they have ever experienced and therefore quite frightening. Yes, you may say that it's all a part of growing up and therefore good lessons for them to learn, and to an extent I agree with you. However, it's important to learn how to prepare for life's challenges so that they aren't overwhelming or scary and so that we are able to manage them the best we can.\nHere are some tips you can use during your kids exam time.\nBreak their revision plan down into small parts. Doing this will help transform what once seemed like a huge impossible task into a more manageable one.\nHelp them arrange properly so that the subjects they like the least (perhaps ones that require more time and effort) are worked on first; once they are out of the way, it will help reduce the worry.\nPlan week on week to make sure they are on track. Ticking items of a list each week will help them to feel good about themselves and their progress.\nCreate rewards for all the ticks - a favourite TV programme, a delicious snack, an hour's surfing the Internet, computer games or whatever it was that they enjoy the most. This will encourage them to carry on and make them feel good.\nThink of strategies on how to deal with exams calmly so their anxieties don't _ et the better _ them.\nTalk about times in their lives when they had been successful at something and look at the qualities they used to get them there - determination, persistence, hard work, patience, positivity, dedication - discuss how they can apply these skills to their exams.\nAcknowledge that if they do their best that is good enough.\nEnsure they realize that this period in their lives will pass and that exams are only a temporary time in their lives; nothing can and does last forever.\nEnsure they keep their eye on the prize: enjoying their long summer holiday when the exams are finished; giving them something to look forward to will help to motivate them and provide a positive end in sight.", "id": "high6587.txt"}
