Their study on players at eight clubs in England and Wales, in the British Journal o f Sports Medicine, showed nearly 4 out of 10 had cavities   and that athletes often had worse teeth than the general population. Regularly taking sugary foods is one possible explanation.\nThe dentists, from the International Centre for Evidence-Based Oral Health at University College London, examined 187 players' sets of teeth. They found 53% had dental erosion  , 45% were bothered by the state of their teeth and 7% said it affected their ability to train or play. Around 40% had cavities, compared with 30% of people of a similar age in the general population.\nProf Ian Needleman, one of the researchers, said:  \"These are individuals who otherwise invest so much in themselves so it's a surprising finding.\n\"There are two main groups - some have a catastrophic effect, they have very serious disease that stops them in their tracks and they cannot play or train.\n\"There Il be others experiencing pain affecting sleep or sensitivity every time they take a drink. \"\nAt this level of athlete, even small differences can be quite telling.\nNutrition is one of the primary suspects with having too many sugary or acidic foods during training potentially accounting for cavities and erosion. A lot of air in the mouth during exercise can also dry it out so there is less protection.\nWhile these findings are worrying, clubs are attaching greater importance to dental health and educating their players. According to Stijin Vandenbroucke, head of medicine and sports science at West Ham United, oral health is an area where many athletes have greater problems than the general population and there are clear benefits of oral disease prevention for athletes and clubs.", "id": "high14350.txt"}
