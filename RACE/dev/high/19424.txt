Sorry I haven't written for so long. I've been quite busy planning my holiday with may older brother, Coin. Do you still remember the trip I told you about? I told you Colin and I would spend a few weeks traveling before he goes to university. Well, now we're ready to go! We're going to visit so many exciting places and do lots of astonishing things. We will go to Africa first. I can't wait! Have you been there?\nWe leave London on 15thJuly, and we'll be flying toprefix = st1 /Morocco, in Northern Africa. We're going to travel on camels through theSaharaDesert. It's the biggest desert in the world-about the size of The US! I expect it will be very hot, dry and dusty _ . We'll be traveling by camel, with local guides, camping in tents and sleeping on the ground in our big, thick sleeping bags. I've heard that we can se beautiful stars on clear nights. I'll bring a torch with me so that I'll be able to see in the dark. The whole trip will take six days. That means I'll have to sit on a came for almost a week-how uncomfortable! I hope my camel likes me!\nAfter the trip by camel, we've going to travel down the River Nile. We'll start at Lake Victoria. A little way down the river from Victoria, the water actually gets quite rough. So, we'll go white-water rafting. It's quite dangerous, but very exciting! We have to wear special clothing, a helmet and a life jacket, just in case the raft gets turned upside down or sinks after white-water rafting, we're going on a trip to see wild animals inKenya. We'll live with the local people in their villages, and eat and drink like they do, including cow's blood! Do you think I should drink it?\nSince we'll be walking every day for almost two weeks, I'll need to buy a large, strong, light backpack to carry my supplies of food and water. During the day, we'll walk across the land, following the footprints of big animals such as elephants, lions and giraffes. We'll try to get as close as possible to the animals, even though they're dangerous, so that I can take some really good photos. But don't worry about me--our Guides will have guns with them to scare the animals away if they come too close. I really want to see an elephant up close. Colin wants to see a giraffe.\nAfter that, we'll be moving on to Tanzania, where we're going to climb Mount Kilimanjaro. Mountain climbing can be very tiring, and many people feel sick as the air gets thinner, so Colin and I will make sure that we will get enough rest after sunset. The African part of our trip will take about four weeks. Then we're going to the Himalayas. I'll send you postcards from all the different places we visit!\n                                                            Love\n                                                             Toby", "id": "high19424.txt"}
