For British scientist Robert Edwards,the answer is having a child.\"Nothing is more special than a child,\"he told the BBC.\nEdwards,the inventor of the In Vitro Fertilization(IVF)technology--more commonly known as\"testtube baby\"technology--passed away on April 10 ,2013 at the age of 87.\nEdwards changed the lives of millions of ordinary people who now rejoice in the gift of their own child,\"said Peter Braude,professor at King's College London.\"He leaves the world a much better place.\"\nEdwards started his experiments as early as the 1950s,when he had just finished his PhD in genetics. At that time,much of the public viewed test-tube babies as\"scary\",according to Mark Sauer,professor at Columbia University,US.\nEdwards and his colleague Patrick Steptoe faced _ from churches,governments and media,not to mention attacks from many of their fellow scientists.\"People said that we should not play God and we should not interfere with nature,\"Edwards once told Times. He said that he felt \"quite alone\" at the time.\n\"But Edwards was a fighter,and he believed in what he was doing,\"said Sauer. Without support from the government,the two struggled to raise funds to carry on. And in 1968 they finally developed a method to successfully fertilize human eggs outside the body.\nThe first test-tube baby was born on July 25,1978.Her name was Louise Brown. Despite people's safety concerns,Brown was just as healthy as other children.\n\"IVF had moved from vision to reality and a new era in medicine had begun,\"BBC commented.\nEver since then,public opinion has evolved considerably. Couples who were unable to have babies began thronging to Edwards' clinic. Nowadays,Reuters reports,some 4.3 million other\"test-tube\" children exist. Edwards received a Nobel Prize in 2010 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II the following year.\nBefore his death,Edwards was still in touch with Louise.\"He is like a granddad to me,\"she said in an interview with the Daily Mail.\nHe is a granddad to millions, in fact.", "id": "high11171.txt"}
