Her husband's friend Richards was there, too.

Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that held her body and seemed to reach into her soul.\nShe could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all aquiver   with the new spring life.

And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.\nThere would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself.
