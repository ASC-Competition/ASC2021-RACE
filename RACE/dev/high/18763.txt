Driven by curiosity, he journeyed to remote comers of the Islamic world, traveling through 44 modern countries, three times as far as Marco Polo. Little celebrated in the West,his name is well known among Arabs. In his hometown of Tangier, a square, a hotel, a cafe, a ferry boat, and even a hamburger are named after him.\nIbn Battuta stayed in Mecca as a student for several years, but the urge to travel soon took over. In one adventure, he traveled to India seeking profitable employment with the sultan--the Muslim ruler of Delhi. On the way, he described his group being attacked in the open country by 80 men on foot, and two horsemen:\"...I was hit by an arrow and my horse by another, but God in his grace preserved me...\"In Delhi, thesultan gave him the position of judge, based on his previous study at Mecca. But the sultan had an unpredictable character, and Ibn Battutalooked for an opportunity to leave. When the sultan offered to finance a trip to China, he agreed. Ibn Battuta set off in three ships, but misfortune struck while he was still on the shore. Asudden storm grounded and broke up two ships, scattering treasure and drowning many people and horses. As he watched, thethird ships, with all his belongings and slaves-one carrying his child-was carried out to sea and never heard from again.\nAfter a lifetime of amazing adventures, Ibn Battuta was finally ordered by the Sultan of Morocco to return home to share his wisdom with the world. Fortunately, he agreed and wrote a book that has been translated into numerous languages, allowing people everywhereto read about his unparalleled journeys.", "id": "high18763.txt"}
