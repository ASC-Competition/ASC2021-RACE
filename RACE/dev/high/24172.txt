This vast lake had a unique reputation as being the best fishing and tourist resort.\nWith the boat undocked and the gear and luggage stored beneath the security of the seats, we set off into the setting sun at 8:30.\nUnlike my parents , I had never been on a fishing boat before and was captivated  by the speed and grace in which it traveled through the waves. The lake was deserted as the sky began to darken and looked more threatening by the minute.\nSuddenly the boat hit something with such a force that we all fell over in our seats. The whole boat shook for a moment, before water started to trickle slowly over stern. My father went to the back and after many attempts to start the engine, he began to look very worried. The water was now rushing in at a much faster rate, tipping the boat at an awkward angle.\nWe tried our best to hold on to something. The worst was yet to come. With our life jackets secured and fastened, we waited as the boat sank deeper into the water. We were soon immersed in the chilly depths. The biting cold was more terrifying than anyone could imagine.\nMy parents, who were dressed in floater jackets, clung desperately to each other, trying to keep their heads above water. I, on the other hand, wasn't so fortunate. A strong gust of wind blew briskly across the lake, bringing with it, torrential rain and threatening thunderstorms. The strong waves carried me on into the night. The waves continued to pound violently, forcing me underwater.\nThe following morning a fisherman found us. By that time, our body temperatures were twenty-four degrees, which meant we were nearly dead. Later investigation showed that we had been in the water for fifteen hours.", "id": "high24172.txt"}
