Of the largest greenhouse gas emitters, only Russia and Japan have agreed to follow me rules. China and India-second and sixth on the list-are making efforts to make cuts.\nThe U.S signed the treaty in 1997 but has not yet agreed to follow the strict rules, which require that greenhouse gas release be reduced by 10% by 2012. U.S. officials are opposed to these mandatory ,or required, cuts in emissions. \"We're worrying that it would be too costly and would hurt the U.S. economy. _ ,\" said Harlan L. Watson, a top U.S. climate official.\nEven if greenhouse gases are reduced, scientists say it will take decades or longer to stop the global warming that is already underway. To help poor countries deal with rising temperatures and climate changes, the UN has developed the \"Adaptation Fund\" to help them improve farming techniques and water systems.\nBut so far, it has only raised $67 million.\n\"The money should come from the countries most responsible and most capable,\" said Kate Raworth, a senior research official from the Oxfam International aid group.
