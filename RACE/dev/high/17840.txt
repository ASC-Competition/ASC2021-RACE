An international study showed that teenagers living with both parents are less likely to suffer from alcohol and drug problems, and a strong  _ is the most effective way to fight against them.\n\"These findings suggest that living with both parents may prevent drug use,\" said Dr. McArdle, of Newcastle University in northern prefix = st1 /England, who led the study. \"They also suggest that attachment, particularly to mothers, is a more effective factor and that this is truly across cultures and substances.\"\nThe report, which is published in the journal Addiction, involved nearly 4,000 teenagers in England,Ireland,Italy,Germanyand theNetherlands. They were questioned about their use of several kinds of drugs and alcohol. The teenagers also filled in questionnaires about their relationship with their parents and grandparents, how well they were supervised   after school and whether they were allowed to meet friends at home.\n\"Both the quality of family relationships and the structure of families have significant influences on youth drug use,\" McArdle said in a statement. But he added a strong maternal bond offered the greatest protection against developing drug habits.\nThe rate of drug abuse among teenagers living with both parents and who bad a good relationship with their mother was 16.6 percent. If either factor was missing the drug abuse rate rose to 32 percent. More than 42 percent of teenagers living in one parent families who did not have a strong bond with their mother used drugs.\nDrug prevention campaigns in British schools and on television warn teenagers about the danger of drugs and alcohol but McArdle said no one is undertaking the issue of their parents' responsibility.\n(http://edu.china.com/zh _ cn/elearn/english/news/512/20020516/11254954.html)", "id": "high17840.txt"}
