Just like children, they adopt a \"look and learn\" approach which means they can mimic   human's actions when going about their tasks.\nBiologists and psychologists at the universities of Vienna and Oxford designed an experiment to test the theory that dogs do have the ability to copy what they see, using a simple wooden box. In the study, ten owners showed their dogs how to open the wooden box, sometimes using their heads to push a handle and sometimes using their hands.\nIn the first part of the test, five dogs were rewarded with a piece of sausage for copying their owners' actions. The other five were rewarded with food for not copying, and using other methods. With each dog the experiment was repeated hundreds of times, and the time taken for a dog to get it \"right\" on 85 percent of attempts (17 goes out of 20) was recorded. The dogs encouraged to mirror their owners reached this point almost three times sooner on average than those rewarded for not copying them. In the second part of the test, all the dogs were only rewarded for copying the method their owners used. The five dogs previously rewarded for copying their owners reached the 85 percent mark more than twice as the other five.\nIn a paper published in Proceeding of the Royal Society, _ concluded, \"Like humans, dogs can't help imitating actions they see.\" Going further, they said, \"The results suggest the imitative   behavior of dogs is shaped more by their developmental interactions with humans than by their evolutionary   history of domestication  .\"\nCaroline Kisko, from the Kennel club, said, \"A dog's behavior is influenced much like that of a child learning right from wrong and adopting similar patterns of behavior. We hope that owners understand the importance of their actions and use this knowledge to set good examples and therefore positively influence the behavior of their pets.\"", "id": "high13683.txt"}
