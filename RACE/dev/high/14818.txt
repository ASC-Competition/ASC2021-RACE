It is responsible for the death of one in ten adults worldwide (about 5 million deaths each year). If current smoking patterns continue, it will cause some 10 million deaths each year by 2020. Half the people that smoke today, which is about 650 million people, will eventually be killed by tobacco.\nTobacco is the fourth most common risk factor for disease worldwide. The economic costs of tobacco use are equally devastating  . In addition to the high public health costs of treating tobacco-caused diseases, tobacco kills people at the height of their productivity, depriving   families of breadwinners and nations of a healthy workforce. Tobacco users are also less productive while they are alive due to increased sickness. A 1994 report estimated that the use of tobacco resulted in an annual global net loss of 200 thousand million US dollars, a third of this loss being in developing countries.\nTobacco and poverty are closely linked.

It contributes to a higher _ rate, since money that could have been used for education is spent on tobacco instead.", "id": "high14818.txt"}
