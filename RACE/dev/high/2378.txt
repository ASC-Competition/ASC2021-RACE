Overall, that is a very exclusive  club; only about a dozen men ever did it in the history of the world and just eight or nine ever stepped foot on it. Most of them are still alive and they discuss their adventures, insights and personal feelings here.\nOne gets the feeling that the rest of us will never know exactly how beautiful the moon is except to take the astronauts's words about it, because even the pictures on this DVD can't convey that.\nSince this documentary is about 100 minutes long, you get a lot of information. You also get reminded how close two of the three men who went up on that historic first walk on the moon almost didn't get home alive.\nAn absence in this documentary is the most famous astronaut of them all: Neil Armstrong, the first man to step foot on the moon! Apparently, he did not want to be part of this film. One of the astronauts mentions something briefly about Armstrong being somewhat of a \"recluse \" now and it \"being understandable with what he's gone through\". From what I've read, a lot of people have tried to make money off him in shady ways and so now he's withdrawn  from the public spotlight.\nThis film, a legacy to the Apollo program and the brave men who ran it, should be in every schoolroom. It would make history more interesting to students.", "id": "high2378.txt"}
