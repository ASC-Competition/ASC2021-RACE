Nowadays, however, one large city is very like another. They all have their Hilton or Sheraton Hotels which look Hilton or Sheraton Hotels everywhere. They all have their McDonald's, their KFCs, their Pizza Huts. Office buildings look the same everywhere, and most city centers are full of office buildings. And, of course, people are driving the same brands of Japanese or European cars, usually wearing the same kinds of clothing and the world's airlines are all flying the same aircraft, Boeings or Airbuses.\nWhat, therefore, is the purpose of foreign travel for people who are not on business? What do tourists hope to experience in a foreign country that they cannot experience at home? Why travel to foreign countries at all? The answer could be that people are very interested in the past. It is a nation's history that is its main attraction. Most of today's tourists travel overseas to find out what foreign countries and cultures used to be like, not what they are like today. The words \" _ \" are now part of the language of tourism, and it is the museums and works of art in many countries that are their main attractions.\nIf they are lucky--and have had sensible, strong governments--many countries also usually have at least a few beautiful places for tourists to visit.\nFinally there is perhaps a nation's greatest attraction: its people. A nation is not just its historical buildings, its works of art or beautiful places, it is also the people who live in it. This is why a country such as Thailand attracts millions of people every year. They come mainly because of the friendliness of the Thai people. It is why the Pacific Islands are also so popular. There may not be much to see or do in Fiji, but there are lots of friendly, smiling people to make visitors feel welcome.", "id": "high12475.txt"}
