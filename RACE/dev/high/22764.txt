A challenging new book by the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker says that the answer is \"yes\".\nIn The Better Angels of Our Nature, Pinker presents data showing that human violence, while still very much with us today, has been gradually declining. Moreover, he says, \"over the long sweep of history, women have been and will be a peaceful force. Traditional war is a man's game: tribal women never band together to attack neighboring villages.\" As mothers, women tend to maintain peaceful conditions in which to bring up their children.\nSkeptics immediately reply that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power. If they were empowered as leaders, the disorder of the world would force them to make the same warlike decisions that men do. Margaret Thatcher,Golda Meir, and Indira Gandhi were powerful women; all of them led their countries to war.\nBut it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of \"a man's world.\" It was their success consistent with male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place. In a world in which women were in the majority of leadership positions, they might behave differently in power.\nSo we are left with the broader question: does gender really matter in leadership? In terms of traditional opinion, various psychological studies show that men tend towards the hard power of command, while women are cooperative and naturally understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion.\nThe key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender, but on how leaders combine hard and soft power skills to produce smart policies. Both men and women will make those decisions.", "id": "high22764.txt"}
