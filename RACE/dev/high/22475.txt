I pull back the curtains and the sky is dark grey. \nHearing my brother is getting up, I go downstairs to make him a cup of tea. He's down in the kitchen about five minutes later, wearing his work clothes, eyes mostly closed against the morning. \n\"Morning.\" I say. \n\"Uh huh.\" \nI leave him to work out what he is going to eat and go back to my room, and get back beneath the quilt . \nThis morning I want to think a while. Today is Dad's birthday; Mom won't mention it. My brother might, just to _ , so I'll keep him sweet when he comes in from work. Every year on my dad's birthday I draw a picture of him; each year he looks a bit different. I'm an artist. It's not that I draw a straighter line or a truer circle, as they try to teach us to do at school. I just get the message across more clearly than other people. More truthfully. I know it.\nI read a lot of books too, mainly about artists, and I try to paint like them. When my dad comes back I'll be able to say \"this is you when I was twelve and I was in love with Monet\" or \"this is you on your thirty-eighth birthday, when I was fourteen, and you'd been gone five years, and I wanted to paint like Dante Gabriel Rossetti.\" And he'll look at each painting and know that I love him and never forget him. \nOn Saturday mornings he'd take me to town and I'd drag him around the art shops. On my sixth birthday he bought me a box of 99 crayons. On my eighth birthday he bought me an easel  , a real one, not a kiddie's. On my ninth birthday he bought me oils. Some mornings I'd wake up and there'd be a book on my pillow about Picasso, or Chagall.\n\"Draw me,\" he'd say. \n\"Aw, Dad, I can't.\"\nI know I should go to school; I'm not one of those kids who are scared to go. But, it's my dad's birthday and I think I must spend it with him. \nSo I spend some time thinking about his hair, which I think is probably no more grey than it was last year; I know hair doesn't age at the same speed every year, but I make his hair longer this year. And in my mind's eye I give him an extra few pounds too. But I keep the smile fixed in my head, like it is when he's happy. \nIt's head and shoulders, so I'll put him in a T-shirt that shows his neck and throat and how strong he is and how brightly his eyes shine and how his eyebrows are dead level straight and still black. \nI try to think of how much I want to show and how much I want to tell. \nThen I pick up a charcoal stick  and do it. I pick up a chalk to add a suggestion of color1 to his eyes, then another chalk for his mouth. \nAnd there he is. \nDad. \nThere  _ are.", "id": "high22475.txt"}
