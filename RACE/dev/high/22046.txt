In their 8year, 12album history, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr altered   popular culture dramatically. And it wasn't just the suits and changing lengths of hair the four Liverpool boys wore that had such an impact, but what they seemed to stand for. The world saw them as the voice of a new generation, one with a very different attitude to life.\n Their influence was at its height in the 1960s, but their music continues to stir listeners today. However, up until recently one aspect of the Beatles was struck in Yesterday: The music had never been remastered  . But on September 9 that situation came to an end, with the release of the entire band's music in a digital makeover. It is probably the biggest reissue   in pop music history, said British newspaper theFinancialTimes.\n The albums were remastered at Abbey Road Studios in London, the location where the band produced much of their work. The cover of their last album, AbbeyRoadof1969, featured the four young men striding   across a zebra crossing on Abbey Road itself. It is one of the most famous of all Beatles images.\n Recently, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the album, hundreds of Beatles lovers gathered there to show their appreciation.\n Pop groups come and go. The boy band pursued by screaming fans one year will be forgotten the next. But the Beatles are one of the few groups whose music seems to have endured  . Why? Paul McCartney's biographer Barry Miles has an explanation: \"They were the first rock band... and they just happened to be the best. They were the first band to play stadiums, to have their own products. They were groundbreaking in every way,\" he says.", "id": "high22046.txt"}
