Different from a traditional printed book, e-books are born digital. \nBeing a firm believer in tablet computers for many tasks not involving heavy data entry, I applaud these new designs of the products. In particular, the SoftBook has nice leather binding  , going far beyond the traditional (and boring) industrial design used for other portable computers. The PocketBook has a more traditional industrial design, typical of leading electronic gadgets  . \nUnfortunately, neither company mentions their product's screen resolution  . Low-resolution monitors (including all computer screens until now) have poor readability: people read about 25% slower from computer screens than from printed paper. Scientists believe that only the screen with 300 dpi displays has the same reading speed as print. So unless they have much better screens, electronic books will have a problem. \nA project called \"the last book\" is getting much attention, which aims at producing a computer in the form of a folio  : a set of pages using \"digital ink\". Users would move forward in the information by turning pages just as they do in a printed book. Hopefully, the scientists will eventually invent a way to make the \"digital ink\" display characters at a high enough resolution to gain the same reading speed as print. \nEven when e-books gain the same reading speed as print, they will still be a bad idea. Page turning remains a bad interface  , even when it can be done more conveniently than by clicking the mouse on a \"next page\" button. \nAnother problem is that most e-book publishers do not warn their customers about the real meaning of the digital rights management (DRM) tied to their products. Generally they claim that it is meant to prevent copying of the e-book. However, in many cases it is also possible that it will result in the complete denial of access by the purchaser to the e-book. The e-book is tied to a specific computer or device. In these cases, the DRM will usually let the purchaser move the book a limited number of times after which they cannot use it on any additional devices. If the purchaser upgrades or replaces their devices, they may lose access to their purchase. Some forms of the DRM depend on the existence of online services to authenticate   the purchasers. When the company that provides the service goes out of business or decides to stop providing the service, the purchaser will no longer be able to access the e-book.", "id": "high20980.txt"}
