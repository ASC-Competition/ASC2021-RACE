He told her not to open it until her birthday. She knew her mother wouldn't tolerate any disrespect to the kind man who helped them out after Vicki's father passed away. Besides, Vicki didn't want to get Uncle Tom angry. But little Vicki didn't want to just hold it and guess what was in it. After all, she looked forward to his coming to show her interesting things, like how to turn an old sock into a doll.\nAll the day, Vicki couldn't stop thinking about the gift. While her teacher was giving a lecture, Vicki sat still in her seat, drawing paper dolls inside the box. When school was done, she raced home. Walking into the room, again, she shook the present, but she heard nothing. Holding her breath, she opened the box and looked inside. Seconds later, she cried. When Mrs Black saw the box, she said angrily, \"Didn't I tell you to leave it alone?\"\nVicki sobbed   and said, \"Mommy, you don't understand.\"\n\"Don't cry to me. You have missed everything now, just because you couldn't wait,\" Mrs Black accused. \"What will Uncle Tom think now?\"\n\"Uncle Tom gave me nothing,\" Vicki cried and handed the empty box to her mother. \"He played a trick on me.\"\nMrs Black said doubtfully, \"Uncle Tom is not like that. You must have dropped it.\"\nVicki kept crying. Only a rapid knock on the door made the house quiet. It was Uncle Tom. He looked at the empty box. \"You have already done it? I told you to wait for your birthday.\"\n\"You didn't give me a gift.\" Fresh tears filled her eyes.\n\"I try to give you something. I know your birthday is a special day. I tell myself to give you something valuable to last your whole life. I think hard and get an idea to give you an important lesson. If you open it on birthday, I see you learn. Then I will make a big party to celebrate, Maybe next year you listen, and then you will understand the gift better.\"\nVicki's cheeks flushed  .", "id": "high13208.txt"}
