What Jack had become was a version of what I wanted to be.\nDuring his talk, Jack  1  his wallet, pulled out a hundred-dollar bill, and said, \"Who wants this?\"\nHnads  shot up in the audience; people leaned forward to see whom Jack would  choose. But I\nran up the  stairs  to the stage and grabbed the bill from his hand. He turned to me and said, \"Yes, that's it! Instead of waiting around for opportunities, simply take the initiative and create what we want!\"\nAfter this week, I asked for his personal e-mail address and sent him e-mail sharing my views and dreams. He kindly e-mailed back simple encouragement such as \"Keep thinking and playing bigger; it's much more fun that way. Love, Jack.\" Then I got occupied with other things in life and I stopped e-mail Jack.\nA year later, my dream gradually faded. I had this idea if I got back in touch with Jack. I e-mailed him again and again but got no response. As I sat down at my computer to check my e-mail for the fifth time in 15 minutes, an inspiration came like lighting: What was I doing? Was I waiting for the prize of life? I knew I needed to do something about all this waiting. I was going to write a book, which I would call \"Waiting for Jack\"!\nIt all sounded good, but then reality hit. Some nights I cried and wanted to give up. I wrote and rewrote. Even though I could feel the fear, I did it anyway. Fortunately, three years later, Waiting for Jack turns out a best-seller on Amazon!\nWe all have a \"Jack\" for whom we wait--whether it's a person, a place or a thing. Now I would like to ask you: what are you waiting for?", "id": "high12609.txt"}
