Finally, Lily could not stand her mother-in-law's bad temper and decided to do something about it.\nLily turned to Mr. Huang, who sold herbs  , for help. She asked if he could give her some poison so that she could solve the problem once and for all. Mr. Huang thought for a while and said: \"Lily, I will help you solve your problem, but you must listen to me and do what I tell you.\" Lily agreed.\nHe told Lily, \"You can't use a quick-acting poison to get rid of your mother-in-law, because that would cause people to become suspicious. Therefore, I have given you a number of herbs that will slowly build up poison in her body. Every other day, prepare some delicious food and put a little of these herbs in her serving. Now, to make sure that nobody suspects you when she dies, you must be very friendly towards her.\" Lily thanked Mr. Huang and hurried home to start her plot to murder her mother-in-law.\nThus every other day, Lily served the specially treated food to her mother-in-law. She controlled her temper, obeyed her mother-in-law, and treated her like her own mother. After six months had passed, the whole household changed. Lily and her mother-in-law were now treating each other like a real mother and daughter.\nOne day, Lily came to see Mr. Huang and asked for his help again. She said: \"Mr. Huang, please help me to stop the poison from killing my mother-in-law! I do not want her to die.\"\nMr. Huang smiled, saying, \"Lily, there is nothing to worry about. I never gave you any poison. The herbs I gave you were vitamins to improve her health. The only _ was in your mind and your attitude towards her, but that has been all washed away by the love which you gave to her. \"", "id": "high8862.txt"}
