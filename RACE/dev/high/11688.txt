All you have to do is to sit around and wait for your meals.There's catch, however.You have to stay in a chicken cage with a stranger for a whole week.There are no books or television or radio for amusement.You can't leave until the week is up.And a camera will be recording your every move.\nTwo people actually took the job.The idea came from Rob Thompson, a video artist.He wanted to make a film about the way animals are treated.His goal was to raise people's awareness of the living conditions of animals that are raised for food.He decided to pay $ 5000 out of his own savings to two people who were willing to lie like chicken for a week.\nTo Rob's surprise, quite a few people answered his advertisement.He had interviews and selected Eric, a 24-year-old restaurant worker, and Pam, a 27-year-old chemist.The plan was for them to spend seven days together in a chicken cage that was six feet long and three feet wide.A camera would record their experience, which would take place in an art museum.\nThe week was long and difficult.They slept on a hard wooden floor.They couldn't stand up without banging their heads.They ate vegetarian mash and drank water from a garden hosepipe .Their only privacy was a toilet surrounded by a curtain.There were no sinks, mirrors, or toothbrushes in the cage.Their only inspiration was the two framed checks that hung on the wall outside the cage.Visitors who came here were warned, \"Do not food the humans.\"\nFinally it was over, Pam and Eric emerged from their cage.They had survived the week, and they each had a $2,500 check in their hands.When Rob Thompson opened the cage, Eric came out, changed into clean clothes, and ate a chocolate bar right away.\"It's great to be able to stand up,\" he said.Pam just changed her clothes and left.After a week of visitors and reporters watching her, she didn't want to talk to anyone.", "id": "high11688.txt"}
