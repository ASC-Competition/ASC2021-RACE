My car was _ and my heart was full, so I pulled over. There was a group directing the cars and another group spraying them down. As sponges  were wiped over every square inch of my dirty car, I sat enjoying the little water bottles. I was amazed at why forty to fifty teenagers had devoted their Saturday to washing cars.\nAfter I handed them a twenty-dollar bill I asked what they were raising money for. They explained to me that a friend of theirs, C.T.Schmitz, had recently died of cancer. He was only fifteen years old. He had gone to school with a lot of the teenagers who were there that day and each of them had memories of a boy sweeter than any they had known. His friend Kevin had decided to put this car wash together because he wanted to honor his friend and also bring together his classmates with his boy scout troop . He told me that they wanted to plant a tree in front of their school and if they raised enough money they would put a plaque  there also. Both would be in memory of their friend C.T.\nThey handed me a bag of homemade cookies with my receipt  saying\"Thanks for helping us plant a tree of C.T.\"\nYeah!
