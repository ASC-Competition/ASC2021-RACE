When it arrived,  I got on and I noticed one little girl called Amy. She was different from everyone else on the bus.\n        \"Don't talk to Amy,\" warned Lauren, who sat beside me. \"Or everybody will make fun of you.\"\n        Amy had many physical differences and the other kids always made fun of her. Her eyes weren't straight. Her glasses were an inch thick. And she had really strange teeth. Every day kids shouted insults at Amy. They would say, \"God, what a strange face! Stop looking at me!\" \nFor a while I shouted insults at Amy too, just so I could fit in. After all, I didn't want the other kids treating me the same as they treated Amy. But it made me sad to insult her. I could see that the insults were making her feel ashamed and lonely. I began to pity her. Then I wanted to stand up for her. I didn't know how to stop my schoolmates insulting Amy until the night of our class skating party.\nOur whole class was there, including Amy. Amy didn't know how to skate, but I could see how much she wanted to have fun like the rest of us. So I skated over to her and took her by the hand. Holding her hand, I slowly pulled her, and together we began the journey around the skating rink. I didn't say a word to her, and she didn't speak to me. She just smiled, and every once in a while she would laugh in excitement.\nThe next morning, on the school bus the other kids talked a lot about Amy and me. But nobody insulted her or me. And they didn't do that for the rest of the year. When the school year ended, my family moved away, and I never heard of Amy again. But I've always hoped that I changed her life for the better.\nShe changed my life as well. After becoming her friend, I no longer tried to impress people by trying to act like them or dress like them. I became myself.", "id": "high20574.txt"}
