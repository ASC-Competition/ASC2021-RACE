It is true that children used to take part in outdoor sports and games. Today many young people stay inside watching television, playing computer games, or surfing the Internet. Rarely can people see children today, enjoying themselves outdoors, on playgrounds or even in neighborhoods.\n   Young people who join in after-school sports activities will be out of the house. They will be on the move, running and jumping, which is great exercise. They will learn discipline and the importance of being a team player, whey they are part of an organized sport. They also learn about good sportsmanship, teamwork and gaining confidence. There are even sports that young athletes do better in school. Outdoor sports give children, teens and young adults the opportunity for fresh air and sunshine, which improve their over-all health. They will obtain Vitamin D from the sun, and burn extra calories which will help prevent obesity  . It is important that a child enjoy what he or she is doing.\n   Children do better in sports events, when they have a healthy desire and a natural ability for a particular activity. While track and field events may not be some small children's cup of tea, there were other children who enjoyed themselves and received rewards. The Rhodes family joined in the Subway Commonwealth Games for the first time. The 3 siblings took home 2 medals each, for a total of 6. Eight-year-old Jerel Rhodes II, won gold medals for the shot put  , and the discus   throw. Seven-year-old Jadyn Rhodes, received a silver medal fro the shot put, and a bronze medal in the 400-meter race. Five-year-old Jase Rhodes took home the gold medal in the 800-meter race, as well as the discuss throw.\n   There is a down side to athletic activities. Not everyone will go home as a winner. If your child does not win a medal, you should not complain about him or her. You should be proud of him or her just for taking part. If a child feels bad about his or her performance, he or she may be teased by other children, or his or her parents may express disappointment. All these can have an effect on self-esteem. The bottom line is to get your children out of the house, and to be involved in activities that keep them moving. Playing on the playground or playing games such as hide and seek can be fun for all. If your child is indeed a young athlete in the making, encourage --but do not push -- him or her to take advantage of organized competitive sports.\nThe Mayo Clinic, an internationally famous medical research group, says that all children should be encouraged to be active in sports. Pushing boys and girls into areas where they are not comfortable, or they do not have the athletic ability could have the worst effect on them. If you encourage those like the Rhodes family, who have the desire to play sports, they just might bring home a gold, silver or bronze medal.", "id": "high17929.txt"}
