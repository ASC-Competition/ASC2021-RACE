My partner and I won the Canadian junior pairs championship when I was 14. Later I was thrilled to be picked to skate in the 1994 Olympics in lillehammer, Norway. But then everything came down. \n   We finished the 12th at the Games. I soon quit double skating and tried to continue in singles. But I wasn't good enough; I didn't even compete in the next two national championships. I felt like I was a somebody who had become a nobody. \n   I was 18 and had just graduated from high school, when my mum told me, \"You can't just depend on skating to make a living. You'd better find a job.\" I knew she was right. So I found a job at a restaurant where I waited at tables and did anything else that needed to be done. In fact, I worked so hard that I had never got the chance to have a break. No one cared that I had been an Olympic skater; I was judged only by how hard I worked. \n   That job taught me so many things. I learned, for example, how to deal with people. As an athlete, this was new to me. One day a man loudly called me over to his table and complained, \"This milk is sour. I am not drinking this junk! I want my money back! \" It was near the end of my shift   and I wanted to tell him how rude I thought he was. But I had learned that \"the customer is always right\" and a smile can go a long way. \"I'm really sorry, sir. I'll get you a free cup.\" I said with a smile. When I brought him his coffee, his attitude changed. And he left me a tip! \n   My first job taught me that it is important to do your best at anything you try. I knew nothing about being a waitress when 1 started my job but by the time I left when 1 decided to return to skating -- I had earned a raise and my boss's praise. They meant so much to me.", "id": "high24267.txt"}
