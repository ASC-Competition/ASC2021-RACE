His name was Ed and he dropped her off for her doctor's appointment, and was going to park the car and wait for her. She was so upset because he never came back to get her. As she described her situation to the person on the phone she started to cry and I knew I needed to take action. \nAfter I introduced myself, she told me her name was Helen. She was talking to a local restaurant they were going to have lunch at after her appointment. She called to see if he was there. She explained her husband \"Ed\" was supposed to park the car and wait for her. Then she said,\" My husband has Alzheimer's  and he shouldn't be driving without me.\" Numerous thoughts ran through my head. Call the police, call her family, call the doctor's office she had just come from ! I offered to drive to the local restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there. \nAfter telling the nurse about the situation we exchanged cell phone numbers in case Ed showed up as I jumped into action searching for him. Once arriving in the parking lot of the restaurant, Helen described she received a call from the nurse, who had found Ed sitting on a bench in front of the hospital a few buildings down waiting for her. What a relief ! Once reunited, we needed to find his car which he forgot where he parked! Fortunately, he parked in the handicapped spot so it was easy to find!\nOnce all this was done, I followed Ed and Helen home to be sure they arrived safely. After I waved goodbye and wished them my best, I thought,  \"That is the kind of love in life, simple but deep. \"", "id": "high22990.txt"}
