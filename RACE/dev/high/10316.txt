Five years ago, researchers found an area in the Atlantic Ocean seabed, where a part of the Earth's outer layer, or crust , is  missing. A thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed.\nThe crust, mantle  and core  are the main layers that make up the planet. The mantle rests between the crust and the core.\nLast month, a team of 12 British scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust.\nThe hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. Scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. \"It is like a window into the interior   of the Earth,\" says scientist   Bramley Murton, who is part of the research team.\nThe site where the hole is located is part of a ridge   of undersea volcanoes.  There, two of the plates that make up the Earth's surface meet. The plates are always   moving. When the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to   fill the gap and form a new crust. But this did not happen in the area where the hole is located.\nThe hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the Earth's   surface. The team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. They hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the Earth's surface behaves under the sea.", "id": "high10316.txt"}
