When I looked in her direction, she apologized: \"Sorry. Was it wrong to take a picture?\"\n\"I can't read my own handwriting ,\"the young woman explained.\"It's best if I take a picture of your writing so I can understand the notes.\"\nThat remark started a class-wide conversation about taking a picture instead of taking notes. For those in the photo-taking camp, motivations extended beyond their inability to comprehend their own handwriting. Some took pictures of notes because they knew their phone was a safe place to store material. They might lose paper, they reasoned, but they wouldn't lose their phones. Some took photos because they wanted to record exactly the manner in which I had noted information on the board. Others told me that during class they liked to be able to listen to the discussion attentively.\nYet the use of cameras as note takers, though it may be convenient, does raise significant questions for the classroom. Is a picture an effective replacement for the process of note-taking?\nInstructors encourage students to take notes because the act of doing so is more than merely recording necessary information--it helps prepare the way for understanding. Encouraging students to take notes may be an old-fashioned instructional method, but just because a method has a long history doesn't mean it's out of date. Writing things down engages a student's brain in listening, visual, and kinesthetic learning--a view supported by a longstanding research. The act of writing down information enables a person to begin committing it to memory, and to process and combine it, establishing the building blocks of learning new concepts.\nTaking a picture does indeed record the information, but it deletes some of the necessary mental engagement that taking notes employs. So can the two be equally effective?\nI'm not sure how to measure the effectiveness of either method. For now, I allow students to take notes however they see fit--handwritten or photographed--because I figure that some notes, no matter the method of note-taking, are better than none.", "id": "high8060.txt"}
