Since moving to Buffalo she's become a big hockey fan and has encouraged me to start watching it. Unfortunately it's very difficult to find hockey on television here in Alabama. Since hockey games don't air very much on television I've had to look for different ways to watch hockey games.\nI often see websites that claim if you go to their website you can watch television on your computer. I try out many of these websites hoping that one of the television stations is a northern station that airs hockey games. Unfortunately, most of them don't work. Either the site doesn't really give you what they advertise or their video player doesn't work properly. But finally I've found one website that actually works.\nFree Tube is a site that you can go to and watch Television online for free. You don't have to download any kind of special software or pay money or even sign up for anything. All you have to do is go to Free Tube, choose your channel and start watching.\nThe different channels to choose from are separated into different categories like news, business, entertainment, music and sports. You're not going to find channels like NBC or ABC so you can watch the latest episode of Heroes or Grey's Anatomy but it does include some popular channels like Cartoon Network and ESPN.\nThere is also a movie section. Each movie channel airs different sorts of films like adventure, classics, comedy or horror and that channel will always air that kind of movies. The movie section also includes my favorite station called Maxx Trailers  . Maxx Trailers airs nothing but movies trailers 24 hours a day. Some of the trailers are for movies coming out and some are for movies that have already been released but already released movies don't go back farther than a couple of months.\nSo far I haven't had any problems with Free Tube's video player either. Whenever I choose a channel, the video almost always works and usually loads every quickly. The only problem I have with Free Tube is that there is currently a _ if you're using Firefox. Once you choose a channel you can't select another channel to change to, your web browser will freeze up. So if you're using Firefox, the only way to switch channels is to leave the site and re-enter the site, when choosing what channel you want to go to. However, Free Tube is aware of this glitch and is working with Mozilla to get it fixed right away.\nIf you're missing some show everyone is talking about like Grey's Anatomy or Heroes, this isn't really a solution for that. But Free Tube is a good way to find channels that you weren't aware of; there are several good stations to be found.", "id": "high5086.txt"}
