One year, I had a student, John,  who entered my class when he was a junior  . John changed to our school from Greece, and seemed to be interested in athletics, so I encouraged him to join our track team. I explained to him that even though he had never taken part in it before, I did believe that he could do well in any event, and I would be willing to coach him at whichever ones interested him. He accepted the offer, and began to work hard at every practice.\nAbout a month later, I had found out from other sources that John was a first-class tennis player, winning various junior awards in his home country. I went to him asking, \"John, I really appreciate that you came out for the track team, but why didn't you play tennis instead? It seems that would interest you a lot more, since you're so good at it.\"\nJohn answered, \"Well, I like tennis, but you told me that you believed in me, and that you thought I could do well in track, so I wanted to try it for that reason.\"\nFrom then on, I often remember my student's reply. I told it to a friend and she suggested I write it down to share somewhere with more teachers. No matter how critical   students can be of themselves, I've found that a simple \"I trust that you can do it!\" can go a long way!", "id": "high8110.txt"}
