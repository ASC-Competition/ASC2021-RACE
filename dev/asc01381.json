  "article": "There are many kinds of ants in America. One kind is very strong. People are afraid of it.\nThese ants move in a large group. They eat all the animals on their way. They can kill and eat elephants, and they can eat wood houses. Sometimes even people are killed by them. When the ants come, people leave their homes. But people are sometimes glad after the ants pass through, because they can see no insects  or snakes.",
