  "article": "In my last essay, I wrote briefly about a bathtub in the classroom. What really was the use of that bathtub? \"Guys, it is Reading Workshop time now. When I call your table, get your things, please!\" said Mrs. Toalson. She was holding a cup that had many sticks in it; on every stick was written each student's name and table number.\nWhat does she mean? Probably books, I thought. Mrs. Toalson picked a stick out of the cup and said, \"Okay, Aniqa's table; Table Two, you may get your things. \"Then my four classmates ran for the cushions in the bathtub. Mrs. Toalson kept picking sticks and calling out different table numbers. On hearing their numbers, students would run to get cushions. Because there were not enough cushions for everyone, the last to be called had to go without. Those students sighed, \"Oh! They are the lucky ones.\"\nFinally, Mrs. Toalson picked the last stick ; what is she going to do now?\n\"Kate, you may use the bathtub. \" Mrs. Toalson said. Gosh! Use the bathtub? Is Kate going to take a bath, I wondered. Kate is the girl who had pretty brown hair. She ran happily with her book to the bathtub and lay down in it. As she read, she hugged a teddy bear. I think it must be comfortable reading in a bathtub.\nExcept for lucky Kate, everybody had to read elsewhere. Some were sitting on the seats, some were lying down under the table, and everybody's reading pose was different.\nJust then, my friend found me sitting at my table quietly, not doing anything. She said, \"Mary, let me find you a book. \" I nodded. Then she led me to a comer of the classroom where the book-shelf was and picked a picture book for me.\nRegina thought that it would be more fun to read outside on the grass. What a great idea! The next day our whole class went to the park across the street from our school. As we read, animals such as squirrels ran around us. It was amazing !",
