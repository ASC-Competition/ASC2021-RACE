  "article": "We know the famous ones--the Thomas Edisons and the Alexander Graham Bells--but what about the less famous inventors? What about the people who invented the traffic light and the windshield wiper ? Shouldn't we know who they are?\nJoan Mclean thinks so.In fact,Mclean,a professor of physics at Mountain University in Range,feels so strongly about this matter that she's developed a course on the topic.In addition to learning\"who\"invented\"what\",however,Mclean also likes her students to learn the answers to the\"why''and''how\"questions.According to Mclean.\"When students learn the answers to these questions,they are better prepared to recognize opportunities for inventing and more motivated to give inventing a try.''\nHer students agree.One young man with a patent for an unbreakable umbrella is walking  proof of McLean's statement.\"If I had not heard the story of the windshield wiper's  invention,\"said Tommy Lee, a senior physics major,\"I never would have dreamed of turning  my bad experience during a rainstorm into something so constructive.\"Lee is currently  negotiating to sell his patent to an umbrella producer.\nSo,just what is the story behind the windshield wiper Well,Mary Anderson came up  with the idea in 1902 after a visit to New York City.The day was cold and stormy,but  Anderson still wanted to see the sights,so she jumped aboard a streetcar.Noticing that the driver was struggling to see through the snow covering the windshield,she found herself wondering why there couldn't be a built--in device for cleaning the window.Still wondering about this when she returned home to Birmingham,Alabama, Anderson started drafting out solutions.One of her ideas,a lever on the inside of a vehicle that would control an arm on the outside,became the first windshield wiper.\nToday we benefit from countless inventions and innovations.It's hard to imagine driving  without Garrett A.Morgan's traffic light.It's equally impossible to picture a world without  Katherine J.Blodgett's innovation that makes glass invisible.Can you picture life without  clear windows and eyeglasses?",
