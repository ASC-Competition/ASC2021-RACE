  "article": "\" Can we go now, Momma?\" little Susie asked, pulling on her mom's arm. Her mother did not answer, only stared blankly at the scene below. Crowds of people marched about with what looked like picket  signs. Other people gathered around them, shouting angry words that she couldn't make out from this distance. This relatively small town in Missouri had never seen so much action. She and Susie were standing at the top of the only high rise building in town for Susie loved to try to find their house among the rows and rows of little boxes.\n\"Momma? \" Susie said in a frightened voice, two seconds before a gun shot went off, making her scream at the top of her lungs. Her mom grabbed her and held her over her shoulder as the tears started pouring. \"What was that? I'm scared, Momma!!\"\n\"Sh Sh Sh,\" her momma whispered in a soothing tone, rubbing her daughter's hair. \"It's just a bad dream, baby. She said both to herself and Susie.\nSusie looked at her with confused eyes at the same time a fight broke out among some members of each group. The little girl gasped in surprise. \"Why are those ants fighting , Momma?\"\n\"Those aren't ants, sweetie; they're people, or, at least they're supposed to be.\"\n\"I don't understand what's going on! I'm scared!!\" the four-year-old child clung to her momma. \"It looks like they're dancing, momma.\"\n\"Yeah, it sort of does, doesn't it?\" her mother said with an air of disbelief. How could the expression of heated anger be so beautiful? It was so wondrously unexpected that it brought soft tears to her eyes.\n\"Why are you scared, Momma? It's just bugs dancing,\" Susie said with an innocent smile, wiping away her mother's tears.",
