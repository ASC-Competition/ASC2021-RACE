He noted that many Somali aid organizations have only Somali members.\n    \"So my group and my whole motto has been'Let every ethnicity and race help Somalia'.I think it's a huge resource to have non-somali people helping Somalia.\"said Mohamud.\n    This year,Students for Somalia and Aadamiga are cooperating on a project to fight     poverty and increase education.Mr.Mohamud said the groups lend money to women who have     lived a long time in refugee camps in Mogadishu.They use the money to start or     support businesses like small food stores.The women must have a child in school in Somalia to     receive the money.She also must pay back the loan,but Mr.Mohamud says the woman does     not return the loan money to the lender.Instead,she gives it to her child's schoo1.That way,he says,the school can make improvements.",
