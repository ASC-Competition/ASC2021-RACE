  "article": "Many Chinese people like American country music( ),such as  the songs of John Denver. But still some people don't know when country music began.\nCountry music is from the folk music  of the Appalachian Mountains in the east of America. There, people sang while playing the violin and guitar. They sang about everyday life, love and their problems. So the songs were sometimes a little sad.\nOne of the most popular country music singers is John Denver, who is also quite famous to the Chinese. For Denver, music was a language that could bring the world together. He says music can bring people together. We will understand  each other better through  music. People are different in colour and they may speak different languages, but people are the same in mind and body . All of them love music and can understand music.\nThe world lost a great man when John Denver died in 1997. But his music and words will live on.",
