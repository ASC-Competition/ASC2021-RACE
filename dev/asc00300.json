  "article": "According to the American Automobile Association , since 1964 all cars sold in the United States have been equipped with seat belts (These are also called safety belts.) . Many studies of automobile accidents have shown that safety belts can save lives. One study showed that forty percent of those killed in auto accidents could have been saved if they had been wearing seat belts.\nUnfortunately, belts are worn only by a small percentage of drivers and passengers -- about fifteen percent in cities, and only nine percent in small towns. And safety belts cannot protect people who do not wear them.\nIn order to find out what kinds of people do wear seat belts, a study was made in several cities of the United States. The following facts were about those who use their safety belts:\n1. They do not smoke while driving.\n2. They have had more education than non-users.\n3. They know someone who was injured (but not killed) in an automobile accident.\nAdvertisements based on these facts have been printed in newspapers and magazines in order to teach people the importance of using seat belts. But these advertisements have not helped much. Some people believe there should be a law requiring drivers and passengers to use safety belts. In Australia, where there is such a law, deaths in auto accidents have decreased twenty-four percent.",
