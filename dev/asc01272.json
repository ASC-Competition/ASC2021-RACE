  "article": "What does a Korean father look like? Strict, cold and focused  only on his job. Well, yes, this is the popular image   of Korean fathers. However, this image does not tell the whole story. Across the country, more and more fathers are looking for the answer to the question: what does it mean to be a good father today? And they choose to attend Father School.\nSet up in 1995, Father School began in Seoul. It was to help Korean men show love to their families. Most of the students are from 30 to 70 years old. They are asked to write letters to their kids as homework and to practice saying \"I love you\" to all family members.\nLike many students in Father School, Edmond Rhim never wanted to come. \"I'm not a bad father,\" he said. \"But it was just difficult for me to communicate with my two teenage kids.\" He began to show up in class, and things got better. When he graduated from the school among 70 other men, he no longer felt awkward   when hugging his wife and kids.",
