  "article": "In every school there is a \"top\" crowd that sets the pace, while the others follow their lead. For example,the top crowd decides that it is smart to wear bright red sweaters. Very soon everybody is wearing a brightred sweater.\nThere is nothing wrong with that, except the fact that bright red is not suitable on some peopleat all.\nThe situation can even become dangerous, if the top crowd decides that it is smart to drink or to drivecars at 70 miles an hour. Then the people who follow the lead are causing danger to people's lives. They arelike sheep being led to the slaughterhouse  .\nPerhaps you have come across situations like these more than once in your life. In fact, at one time oranother you probably did something you knew to be wrong. You may have excused yourself by saying, \"Thecrowd does it.\" Well, let the crowd do it, but don't do it yourself. Learn to say, \"No.\" Make your own judge  . If you know the crowd is planning something with which you disagree, have the courage to leavethem politely. You'll have the satisfaction of standing on your own feet.",
