  "article": "Ever since the global economic recession( ) began in 2008,many Americans have changed their lifestyles by downsizing what they buy and what they possess.\nTammy Strobel and her husband used to own a two-bedroom apartment,two cars and had good incomes. But Tammy wasn't happy.Inspired by a web site,they began donating some of their belongings to charity, and eventually got rid of their cars.Some thought they were crazy,but now they feel much happier.Without debt and working fewer hours,now they have more time to be outdoors and to volunteer.\n\"The idea that you need to go bigger to be happy is false,\"Ms. Strobel says. \"I really believe that the acquisition of material goods doesn't bring about happiness.\"\nDespite the fact that the economy is not as booming as it was,studies have shown that many are feeling happier as they save more and spend less.This mainly happens when they spend money on experiences instead of material objects and when they relish what they plan to buy long before they buy it.\nIt is true that extra cash always makes life a little easier because it lets people meet basic needs.But scholars have found that types of purchases,their size and frequency,and even the timing of the spending all affect long-term happiness.One major finding is that spending money for an experience---concert tickets,French lessons, sushi-rolling classes---produces longer-lasting satisfaction.\nAt the height of the recession in 2008,consumers were doing something different---vacationing in their yards, eating more dinners at home,organizing family game nights .As a result, these leisure activities appeared to make them less lonely and increased their interactions with others.\n\"I think people are realizing they don't need what they had.They're more interested in creating memories,\"says a scholar.\nTo stop purchasing things using credit cards at any time brings happiness,too;in other words,waiting for something and working hard to get it makes it feel more valuable and more stimulating. In fact,scholar have found that anticipation increases happiness. Considering buying an i-Pad?You might want to think about it as long as possible before taking one home.\nMs.Strobel is now an advocate  of simple living.\"My lifestyle now would not be possible if I still had a huge two-bedroom apartment filled to the gills with stuff,two cars,and 30 grand  in debt,\"she says. \"Give away some of your stuff,\" she advises. \"See how it feels.\"",
