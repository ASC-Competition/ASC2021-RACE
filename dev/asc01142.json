  "article": "English breakfast is a very big meal --eggs, tomatoes, tea, coffee....\nFor many people lunch is a quick meal. In cities there are a lot of sandwich  bars ,where office workers can buy brown or white bread or a roll  ,and then all kinds of salad and meat or fish to go in the sandwich. School children can have a hot meal at school, but many just take a sandwich, a drink and some fruit from home.\n\"Tea\" means two things. It is a drink and a meal , some people have afternoon tea, with sandwiches, cakes and a cup of tea.\nThey usually have the evening meal quite early, between six o'clock and eight o'clock, and often all the family eats together. On Sundays many families have a traditional lunch. They have chicken, pork,... with potatoes ,vegetables...\nThe Englishmen like food from other countries too, such as French, Chinese, Italian and Indian. People often get take-away meals---they buy the food outside and then bring it home to eat.",
