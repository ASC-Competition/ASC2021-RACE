  "article": "\"The more you learn, the more you earn,\" said the pop singer Cyndi Lauper as she accepted her high school diploma  , at the age of 35 ! Although Cyndi made it without a high school degree, most people don't. In the USA today, about 75% of jobs need some education or technical training further than high school.

And great athletes and entertainers outearn everyone else!",
