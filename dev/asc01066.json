  "article": "This month in Travelers Corner there are three teenagers' experiences in year-abroad programmes.\nMariko Okada - Tokyo\nMy year abroad in the United States was a fantastic experience. I'm not a shy person, and I was very comfortable speaking to everyone. So I got lots of speaking practice. I also learned lots of interesting things about American culture. When I got home, my friends all said that I had improved so much! I hope to go back again in the future.\nCarla Fonseca - Rio de Janeiro\nI spent last year studying English in London. I'm from a small town, and London is a very big city. Sometimes I felt it was too big. There were so many people to talk to, but I always felt bad about my English. I missed my family, and I really missed my two cats. My roommate was always using our telephone, so I hardly had the chance for a nice long talk with my parents. I think it was a good experience for me, but I'm glad to be home!\nAlvin Chen - Hong Kong\nStudying in New Zealand was a fun experience for me, but it was also lots of hard work! I had English classes six hours a day, five days a week----with lots of homework. I also kept a diary of my experience. I like to write, and I wrote two or three pages in my diary every day. On Saturdays, my homestay family took me to lots of interesting places and showed me so many wonderful things about the culture. I'm really glad I went!",
