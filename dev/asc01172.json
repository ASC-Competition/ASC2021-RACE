I don't have any sisters in the family.\nWe live with Grandpa in a small house in Liverpool, in the northeast of England. My parents work in Chesterfield. They come back home every weekend.\nDo you like games? I like football. My favourite team is Manchester United . My friends and I often play football on Saturdays. Sometimes my brother goes with us, but he isn't good at playing football.\nI have seven pets---two birds and five goldfish. I want to have a dog and a cat too, but my grandfather doesn't like them.\nPlease write to me soon.\nBell",
