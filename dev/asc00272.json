  "article": "You're standing in the dairy section at the grocery store, searching for your favorite brand. Suddenly, you catch a smell of chocolate cookies. You forget about dairy and head for the bakery   section. Guess what? You just walked into an odor   trap  ! The odor was cooked up by scientists in a lab.\nFor years, scientists have been studying the special powers of smell. They found that more than our other senses, smell changes our mood and helps us remember things.\nSo companies have begun spending thousands of dollars to scent   entire stores. Artificial   scents are being used to lead customers by the nose. These smells help to get people inside and put them in the mood to buy. They even make customers remember the store later, so they'll come back for more. Also, many companies have smartly made use of product smells. A company added lemon fragrance to its dish cleaner. They wanted people to think the soap contained \"natural\" cleaners. It worked!\nNew uses for smells are being created every day. One bank, for example, gives customers coupons   advertising car loans  . To get people to take out a loan, bank officials hope to coat these coupons with the fresh leather smell of a new car. In Australia, telephone offices are putting sweat odor on unpaid bills. Since some people sweat when they're scared, this smell might remind them of when they were frightened. And they'll pay the bills right away!\nWhat lies ahead for our noses? Smell scientists are working on some pretty far-out ideas. Would you believe TV sets that produce smells? Or how about scent diets? Certain food smells will fool your stomach into thinking it's full. Alarm clocks will scent your bedroom with a strong pleasant smell designed to wake you up. Scientists are even working on ways to keep garbage from smelling. Researchers expect scents to help students make more sense of what they're learning.\nAnd just think.",
