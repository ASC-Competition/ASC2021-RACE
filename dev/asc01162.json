  "article": "How often do you change your hairstyle or ask for new clothes? Do you care much about fashion?\nA recent survey among high school students in China, Japan, South Korea and the US found that Asian teenagers cared more about their appearance   than teenagers in the US.\nThe survey was made in 156 high schools in the four countries. South Koreans cared most about their appearance. They were followed by the Chinese and Japanese, while US students showed the least interest in fashion.\n\"The different results show the differences of cultural backgrounds  ,\"said Sun Yunxiao from the China Youth and Children Research Centre.\nHe explained that in the US there are many different standards   of beauty, so teens are more likely to be confident about their appearance. About 85% of American teens are happy with themselves. Besides, most US students agree that people should follow their own interests rather than those of others.\n\"According to the survey, Chinese students are happy and disciplined  . They have a strong desire to make a difference. But Chinese students depend on their parents too much, so they need to be more independent _ Besides, they should learn how to relax,\" said Sun.",
