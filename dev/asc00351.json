  "article": "It's cool, and it's hot, and everyone is doing it. People talk about it often, and friends tell other friends how good they look. Sound like a fashion? It's actually another trend : \"blog\". What's a blog? A blog is a personal online diary. The word \"blogger\" means a person who writes diaries online.\nMany bloggers are teens who've been logging  onto sites to discuss anything in their lives. Many of today's teenagers are not afraid to openly discuss everything in their lives. Teens complain  about parents and homework. They share diaries, post songs from the latest bands and show pictures of theirs. They write their own poems, say something about their girlfriends or boyfriends and complain to each other or offer support. But mostly they just write down what they do every day.\nHowever, many parents are afraid of these young bloggers. Parents see the kids talking about how they got drunk last weekend and how they don't like studying. They are using language that is surprising to their parents. Besides hearing from their friends, teen bloggers also get message from strangers. Most of the time, it's older men asking to meet teenage girls. \"These strange men are dangerous for my kids. They sometimes teach my kids bad words, \" said Cara Cabral, a mother of two.\nMany teens and young adults know it's not safe to use blogs on the Internet. They know they are putting information about themselves in a place they can be seen by anyone. But teens are unlikely to give up these new communication tools that have becomes a way of life for many of them.\nAre you a bloggers? What do you think of the blog?",
