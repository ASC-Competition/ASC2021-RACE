  "article": "I felt very sad not to be able to get the ticket for the film Titantic last Friday. I learned in the newspaper that ticket could be bought at the cinema box office   in Richland Hill every day between 10:00 and 4:00. Because I work from 9:00 to 5:30, the only time I could go to the cinema was during my 45-minute lunch time. It is a pity that the cinema is on the other side of the town, and the bus service between my office and Richland Hills is not very good. But if you are lucky, you can make the round  trip in 45 minute.\nLast Monday I stood at the bus stop for fifteen minutes, waiting for a bus. By the time I saw one come around the corner, there was not enough time left to make the trip---- so I had to go back to the office. The same thing happened on Wednesday. On Thursday my luck changed, I got on a bus right away and arrived at the cinema in twenty minutes. But when I got there, I found a long line of people at the box office. I heard one man say he had been waiting in line for fifty-five minutes. I found that I would not have enough time to wait in line, I caught the next bus and went back across the town.\nBy Friday I understood my only hope was to make the trip by car.it was not cheap,but I felt it would be worth ot to see the film. The trip by car only took 10 minutes, but it felt like one hour to me. When I reached the cinema, I was _ to see that nobody was waiting in line. But quickly found out that it was because they had already sold all the tickets.",
