  "article": "Copenhagen, one of the world's most bicycle-friendly cities, has begun turning its extensive network of cycle paths into bike highways in an effort to push more commuters   to leave their cars at home.\nConsidered one of Europe's two \"bicycle capitals\" along with Amsterdam, Copenhagen counts more bicycles than people and cycling is so popular that its numerous bike paths can become jammed. Two-wheeler traffic jams are especially regular on the main Noerrebrogade thoroughfare   used by around 36,000 cyclists a day. \"You have to elbow your way to go forward and some cyclists aren't always thoughtful,\" complains 22-year-old university student Lea Bresell.\nThe creation of bike highways \"comes right on time\", says Danish Cyclist Federation spokesman Frits Bredal. \"Copenhagen's roads are overloaded with people who want to ride their bicycles in all kinds of weather,\" he says. If in the 1960s Danes viewed the car as the symbol of freedom, the bicycle has assumed that role today, Bredal says. \"It's a means of transportation used by all social classes, and even politicians ride bikes,\" he says.\nIt is on crowded Noerrebrogade -- the busiest bicycle street in Europe -- that city planners have decided to build the first of Copenhagen's environmentally friendly streets. The jammed bike paths will be widened up to four meters on either side of the road, which will itself be reserved for bikes only. The idea is to make Noerrebrogade \"Europe's great cycling street\", says Andreas Roehl, the Copenhagen city's bicycle program manager who is also known as \"Mister Bike\". But Roehl is not content with making life easier for Copenhagen's inner city cyclists: He wants to get suburbanites out of their cars and onto two wheels as well. His goal is to increase the percentage of suburban commuters cycling to and from the city from the 33 percent it is today to more than 50 percent by 2015. Within the city, 55 percent of all commuters already travel by bike.\nAlready Copenhagen stands out among other European capitals for its cycling infrastructure, counting more than 390 kilometers of bike paths.",
