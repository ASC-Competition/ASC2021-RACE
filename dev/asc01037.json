Go to a quiet place for a month, go to bed early, drink some milk, walk a lot and smoke one cigar   a day.\"\n\"Thank you very much,\" said old John, \" I will do everything you say.\"\nA month later old John came to the doctor again. \" Well, I'm glad to see you. You look much younger.\" Said the doctor.\n\"Oh , doctor,\" said old John, \"I feel quite well now. I had a good rest. I went to bed early, I drank a lot of milk, and I walks a lot. Your advice certainly helped me. But you asked me to smoke one cigar a day, and the one cigar a day nearly killed   me at first. It's no joke to start smoking at my age.",
