  "article": "Shu Pulong has helped at least l000 people bitted  by snakes. \"It was seeing people with snake bites  that led me to this career\" he said.\nIn l963, after his army service, Shu entered a medical school and later became a doctor of Chinese medicine. As part of his studies he had to work in the mountains. There he often heard of people who had their arms and legs cut off after a snake bite in order to save their lives.\n\"I was greatly upset by the story of an old farmer I met. It was a very hot afternoon. The old man was pulling grass in his fields when he felt a pain in his left hand. He at once realized he had been bitten by a poisonous snake. In no time wrapped a cloth tightly around his arm to stop the poison spreading to his heart. Rushing home he shouted 'bring me the knife!' Minutes later the man lost his arm forever.\"\n\"The sad story touched me so much that I decided to devote myself to helping people bitten by snakes,\" Shu said.",
