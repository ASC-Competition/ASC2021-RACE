He thought for a few seconds and then said, \"Has the letter got to go far?\" \"What does that matter?\" answered Ali.\n    \"Well, my writing is so strange that only I can read it, and if I have to travel a long way to read your letter to your wife, it will cost you a lot of money.\" Ali went away quickly.",
