  "article": "About one-third of a typical home's heat loss occurs through the doors and windows. Energy-efficient doors are insulated  and seal tightly to prevent air from leaking through or around them. If your doors are in good shape and you don't want to replace them, make sure they seal tightly and have door sweeps at the bottom to prevent air leaks. Installing insulated storm doors provides an additional barrier to leaking air. Most homes have many more windows than doors. Replacing older windows with new energy-efficient ones can reduce air leaks and utility bills. The best windows shut tightly and are constructed of two or more pieces of glass separated by a gas that does not conduct heat well. If you cannot replace older windows, there are several things you can do to make them more energy efficient. First, caulk(...) any cracks around the windows and make sure they seal tightly. Add storm windows or sheets of clear plastic to the outside to create additional air barriers. You can also hang insulated window curtain on the inside--during the winter, open them on sunny days and close them at night. During the summer, close them during the day to keep out the sun.",
