  "article": "Young visitors to museums often complain about having museum feet,the\ntired feeling one gets after spending too much time in a museum.A case of museum feet\nmakes one feel like saying:\"This is boring.I could have done the painting myself.\nWhen can we sit down? What time is it?\nStudies of museum behavior show that the average visitor spends about four seconds looking at one object.For young visitors,the time call be even shorter.Children are more interested in smells,sounds,and the \"feel'' of a place than looking at a work of art.If they stay in a museum too long,they will feel tired and become impatient.\nTo avoid museum feet,try not to have children look at too many things in one visit.It is reported that young visitors get more out of a visit if they focus on no more than nine objects.One and a half hours is the ideal time to keep their eyes and minds sharp,and their feet happy.",
