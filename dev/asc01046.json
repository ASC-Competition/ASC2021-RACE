  "article": "When I was a little girl, my family lives in a small village. There was a very beautiful river near my home. The water was clean and cool. I liked to go fishing there with mom. We would catch fish, look for clams and play in the water. There were also a lot of  birds near the river. We would spend all day watching the birds. Life was beautiful and wonderful in the old days.\nNow my family lives in the city. Last Sunday my daughter asked me to take her to see the beautiful river I was always talking about. \"I want to go fishing there with you and Grandma ao much,\" she said.\nWhen we went to the river, we only saw a factory and a mountain of garbage . My mom was surprised, my daughter was quite _ and I was sad--the river was my best friend. I grew up with it. Now there are no fish in it; the birds are gone, too. I hear it crying for help. But what can I do ?",
