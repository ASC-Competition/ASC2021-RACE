  "article": "The crowd cheered and cheered. The man with the horn waved and smiled his great, happy smile.\"More! More!\"cried the crowd. And Louis Satchmo Armstrong took his horn and began to play again. Here he was inprefix = st1 /England. Now a famous man, he was rich. He knew many important people. Wherever he went, people knew his name. They wanted to hear his music. As Louis played the sad, slow songs, he thought of his home inNew Orleans. He lived there as a boy. How many years ago it was? It was a busy, exciting city. But Louis' family was very poor. He went to work to help his mother. He also went to school.  One of Louis' teachers asked him to be in the school band\"This horn is yours until you leave our school,\"his teacher said. Louis' music was jazz and he loved it. He remembered all the music he heard. He didn't learn to read music until he was a man.\n   When he left school, he played in many bands. He loved his work and people loved him. They knew he had a wonderful talent. Louis played on the boats that sailed up and down the river. He played in little towns and in big cities. Satchmo's horn had as many sounds as ten horns-sometimes slow and sweet; sometimes fast and hot, high and low. His music was always strong and exciting.\"He does make wonderful music,\"said the man who listened happily.\"Yes,\"said another man,\"he makes that horn speak.\"Then the music jazz as I can play. I thought jazz was my music, but now I understand it is ours. Isn't it beautiful how music brings us together!\"",
