  "article": "Want to be perfect at a holiday dinner party? Follow these tips on good manners, and your dinner companions are sure to be thankful.\n*Arrive no earlier than the time the host has announced and no later than half an hour after the time.\n*Plan to stay about an hour after dinner unless travel plans or sleepy children which make you leave a bit earlier.\n*Bring a gift and write a note of thanks afterwards.\n*Offer to help set up for dinner and to clean afterwards.\n*Tell the host of any special dietary needs---if you are a vegetarian, diabetic or allergic to common foods. You can tell the host how to prepare a dish you can eat, or even better, offer to bring that dish yourself.\n*If you're going to a potluck   dinner, bring a serving dish with you as an offer. Remember, the best potluck dishes are those that need little preparation in the host's kitchen, can be served at room temperature and need only a fork to eat.",
