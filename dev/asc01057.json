  "article": "When you are reading something in English, you may often meet with a new word. What's the best way to know it?\nYou may look it up in the English-Chinese dictionary. It will tell you a lot about the word: the pronunciation, the Chinese meaning and how to use the word. But how can you know where the word is thousands of English words? How to find it in the dictionary both quickly and correctly?\nFirst, all the English words are arranged  in the letter order. In the dictionary you can first see the words beginning with letter A, then B, C, D.... That means, if there are two words \"desert\" and \"pull\", \"desert\" will be certainly before \"pull\". Then if there are two words both beginning with the same letter, you may look at the second letter. Then the third, the fourth... For example, \"pardon\" is before \"plough\", \"judge\" before \"just\", etc.\nDo you understand how to look up in the dictionary?\nThe dictionary will be your good friend. I hope you'll use it as often as possible in your English study.",
