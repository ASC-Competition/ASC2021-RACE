  "article": "My favourite great book is The adventure of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri. He's a lively and clever young boy, and he finds himself in many exciting adventures . He runs away with his friends, Huck Finn and Joe, to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days. With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave and finally they find a box of gold.\nMy favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead. He decides to go to his town funeral. He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is surprised to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story, but there are another important characters. Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him . Becky is pretty with fair hair, Joe is Tom's best friend and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the story is about children growing up. It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom, social rules and how people are punished for bad behavior.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876, but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story. Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in the 19thcentury, so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature. Go on--read it! I know you'll enjoy it, too.",
