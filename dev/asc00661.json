  "article": "In 1857 Louis Pasteur accepted a position at the Ecole Normale Superieure, a prestigious school in Paris.There, he continued the research on fermentation  that he had started earlier.\nUltimately, his research led to the process of pasteurization , which uses heat to kill harmful germs in a variety of food products.Later, Pasteur took on industry-related cases such as a disease affecting the silk industry.Beginning in 1865, Pasteur spent three years investigating the bacteria that were the culprits and developing ways to prevent their spread.\nIn 1866 Pasteur lost two daughters to typhoid fever.Two years later he became partially paralyzed as a result of grief and stress.But despite these difficulties, Pasteur pressed on to even greater accomplishments.\nIn the late 1870s, Pasteur began research in the emerging scientific field of immunization and developed a vaccine  for the deadly disease rabies.Following this success, the Pasteur Institute was founded to support Pasteur's work.Pasteur headed the institute until his death in 1895.Since then, the institute has continued to grow.Today, the institute's headquarters in Paris contain over 130 laboratories along with extensive teaching facilities and the institute's own medical center.Over the years, the institute has also extended through the establishment of around thirty research centers in other countries.At each one, researchers help local authorities monitor public health and provide medical treatment.\nUnlike many research organizations, the Pasteur Institute is not government funded.Instead it relies on financial gifts that it receives from institutions and ordinary people.This insures the institute's independence and enables it to respond quickly when health needs arise.",
