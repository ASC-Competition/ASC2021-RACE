I'm happy that I can do something for the Earth.\nBen: Right. That's why we had this plan to get our clean beach back. Do you know if Paul's coming?\nI remember he had the same idea and said he would try his best to come over.\nJudy: But he just called and said he wouldn't come today because it's too hot.\nBen: I can't believe it! He always says, \"We can do this and that . . . .\"\nJudy: Don't you know him? He only _ what should be done but never does anything.\nBen: I see. Let's forget about him. We'll have Tony and Sophie to help us soon.\nJudy: That's great. So where should we start now? Should we pick up those bottles first?\nBen: Sure, let's go.",
