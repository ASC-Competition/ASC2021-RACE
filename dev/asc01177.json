  "article": "Lucy Li is only an 11-year-old girl, but she's the youngest person to qualify for   a US Women's Open Golf Tournament  .\nShe qualified for the US Women's Open in May 2014. And today she is playing with some of the best female golfers in the world. Earlier this week Li said that she wasn't nervous  . \"I just want to have fun and play the best I can and I really don't care about the result. I can learn a lot from these great players.\"\nLi doesn't spend all her time golfing. Her favourite subjects are Maths, History, and Science and she loves to read. She also loves medicine, diving, badminton, dancing and table tennis. But golf is her favourite sport. \"I like golf because it's different from other sports. Anybody can play it,\" she said.\nSome golfers are worried that Li isn't quite ready. \"When I found out she qualified, I said, where does she go from here? You qualify for an Open at 11, and what do you do next? If it was my daughter, I wouldn't let her play in the US Open at 11, but that's just me,\" said world champion Stacy Lewis.",
