  "article": "Can you remember a world before the Internet? If you answer is \"no,\" then you are probably a millennial. Millennials are the new generation of young Americans. They were born between 1982 and 1992. There are 33 million of them, and they are just starting to enter the workforce . Many experts believe that millennials are different from young Americans of past generations. They also believe that millenials will change the workforce in important ways.\nHow are millennials different? They are the first generation born in the computer age. The internet has always been a part of their lives. They spend about 16 hours a week on the Internet, and this doesn't include e-mail. And they spend 72 hours a week using other electronic media , including mobile phones and video games. They are \"nation speakers\" of the language of the computer age. People who were born earlier will never be native speakers of that language. Why not? They did not grow up \"speaking\" it.\nHow will millennials change the workforce? To answer that question, it is important to understand how millennials use the Internet. They use the Internet to communicate. They visit website such as FaceBook and MySpace every day. They share ideas, music, information, games, and friendships with people all over the world. When they start working, they will want to share their work and ideas with others.\nIt is also important to understand the way millennials grew up. Thair parents and teachers gave them a lot of attention. They taught them that their opinions were valuable . As a result, amny millennials are very cinfident. At work, they will expect their co-workers and bosses to listen to their opinions.\nMillennials also grew up with a lot of structure in their lives. Many of them went to school from the age of two or three and played on sports teams. At work, they will expect the rules to be clear. They will also expect a strong but fair boss, like a coach on a sports team. They will follow the person in charge   if he or she is fair. But they will not follow an unfair boss. They will also expect their work to be fun and creative, similar to their experience on a sports team.\nThese are a few of the changes that experts believe millennials will bring to the American workforce. But the world is changing very fast. There will probably be more changes that are difficult to imagine today.",
