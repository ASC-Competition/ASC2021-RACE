  "article": "Moms take care of their children and dads bring home food and make the family rules. These are the roles moms and dads fall into when they become parents and it's common among all cultures. But times change and parents' roles seem to be changing,too. More women are bringing home food by having fulltime jobs and men are taking care of their children at home.\nChinese TV show Where Are We Going,Dad?provides a closer look at the changing roles of dads in modern family life. The show follows the adventures   of five celebrity   dads who take trips with their young children (aged 4 to 6) and try to complete a set of tasks. It shows how young dads are trying hard to find the best way to raise their children and keep a closer relationship with them. Young dads no longer want to be cold.\nPsychologists   say that a strong fatherly influence is important in a child's development. Fathers teach their children skills and encourage them to try new things. They also give them a sense of safety. A child learns that if something goes wrong,he or she can depend on dad to help fix it. The psychologists also say that without a dad,a child is more possible to drop out of school and get into trouble.\nA mother's love is important,and so is a father's love. Chen Mo,a psychology professor says,\"It takes both parents to raise a child. Children have different needs at different ages and this needs to be considered  by both parents.\"",
