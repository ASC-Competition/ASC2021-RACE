  "article": "So he put a notice on the gate of the farm: whoever finds the gold watch will be rewarded 100 dollars.\nPeople tried their best to look for the watch in order to get the reward. However, the barn was too large and the straw in the barn was too thick,it was getting dark they were still unable to find it. So they give up the reward of 100 dollars one by one.\nBut only a small boy was still not discouraged but kept looking for it .He had nothing to eat throughout the day.In order to solve the family problem, he looked forward to finding the gold watch and let his parents,brothers and sisters have a full meal.\nThe night was already getting late,the boy was also tired. He was lying in the straw to have a rest when he heard a strange \"tick--tock \".\nHe immediately held his breath and listened carefully,and followed the sound. He found the watch and got the 100 dollars.\nLike the gold watch in the barn,success has been around us and spread in every corner of life. Only when we are calm and firmly look for it ,we can find it.",
