  "article": "People began to make robots about several hundred years ago. In the past, some of the early ones looked like animals or humans. However, they couldn't talk and were pretty _ . They worked like clocks and did the same things over and over again.\nNow modern robots don't always look like people. Some are like big machines; others are nothing but long arms attached to boxy bodies. However, modern robots are smart. Some can solve problems on their own. Their brains are computers and their eyes are sensors . Motors help them move.\nIn the future, robots will learn from their mistakes more than they do now. They will be smarter. It's possible that we will have robot judges, robot household workers, and robot factory workers. Robots will help people to do more things.",
