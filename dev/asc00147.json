  "article": "In the tenth grade,I began working for free at a vet's that was run by a friend. I wanted to get experience for what I thought would be my future job. However,on one particular Saturday morning I learnt something perhaps more important.\nThe hospital was in the middle of one of the poorer sections of the city and some people could only pay for the most basic treatments. On this Saturday,a man and his young son,who was probably about 7 years old,walked in with a small cat in a cardboard box. There was something wrong with the cat's left eye. But the man could not afford to pay for the cost of the medicine. He kept quiet for a while,and then he asked where the nearest animal shelter was. Hearing this,his son cried and started to argue with him. All of a sudden,an older woman who was sitting in the waiting room stood up,walked up to the counter,and told the man that she would pay for the cost. The man thanked her and the son got to keep a healthy cat.\nI always thought it was the right thing to help out a needy person,but I only saw people do acts of kindness on TV or in movies. What the woman did made me believe that these things do happen in real life,and quite often.\nNow,when I can't decide whether to help someone who is in need,I remember this woman,and then I have the courage to step up to the plate. Sometimes other people follow.",
