  "article": "Wherever travelers go, cameras are sure to follow. It's great fun to take photos, and even more fun to show _ of the trip to friends and relatives when they come back home.\nThere's Aunt Sarah, smiling in front of Buckingham Palace; Aunt Sarah, smiling under the Eiffel Tower; and Aunt Sarah, smiling in a Venetian Canal. Everyone knows what Aunt Sarah looks like; they also know what Europe's great landmarks   look like.\nBut a young man named David, just back from a trip to Greece, asked a few friends over to see his slides. The young man had an artist's eye. His pictures were not of familiar Greek architectures. Instead he took pictures of farmers at work in the field, fishermen repairing their nets, and bearded priests   bending over their Bibles. He captured   the color and character of the country. His friends were so interested that they asked for more.\nAny amateur   can do the same. All he needs is a simple camera and a little sensitivity. When he learns that a nation lives in its people as well as in its landmarks, he moves from an amateur to an artist.",
