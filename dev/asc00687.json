  "article": "We don't plan to cry, but it just happens. In fact when we feel sad or angry, a good cry is almost impossible to resist. But if you didn't know what crying was, you'd have to wonder why some strong feelings started water streaming from people's eyes and why they seemed to feel better afterwards.\nNow a US researcher had found there may be more in crying than we think. William H. Frey II, author of \"Crying: The Mystery of Tears,\" believes it may really be one of the body's clever self-repair mechanisms. Crying may be a way of getting rid of the by-products of stress, he says.\nHe has found that tears contain some chemicals which can cause stress. One of these is the hormone prolactin  , which is set free when one is feeling stressed. Since women have more of this than men, that might explain why they usually cry more, he suggests.\nUnsurprisingly, Dr Frey's study seemed to prove that most people feel better after a good cry. And sex has nothing to do with it --- the result was true for women and men. So, next time you feel like bursting into tears, go ahead. If Dr Frey is right, you'll be doing yourself a favour.",
