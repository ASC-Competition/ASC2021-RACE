He sees the crow and the meat. \"How can I get that piece of meat?\" he thinks.\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Crow.\" says the fox, \"How are you?\" But the crow doesn't say a word. \"You have very nice babies, Mrs. Crow.\" says the fox, \"How are they? May I see them ?\" Still the crow doesn't say a word.\n\"You are very beautiful, Mrs. Crow, and you have a beautiful voice ,too.\" says the fox, \"Would you please sing a song for me? \"Mrs. Crow thinks \"How nice Mr. Fox is! I must sing him a song.\" So she opens her mouth and begins to sing. At that time, the meat drops down from her mouth.",
