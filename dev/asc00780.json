  "article": "When the lazy days of summer arrive and the schedule is filled with swimming,camp,and family vacations,it can be a challenge to find time for learning. But kids' reading skills don't have to grow cold once school's out. Here are some ways to make reading a natural part of their summer fun:\nExplore your library. Visit your local library to borrow books and magazines that your kids haven't seen before. Many libraries have summer reading programs, book clubs, and reading contests  for even the youngest borrowers. With a new library card,a child will feel extra grownup by borrowing books.\nRead on the road. Going on a long car trip?Make sure there are some books at the back seat. When you stop driving,read the books aloud. Get some audio books in libraries and listen to them together during driving time.\nMake your own books. Pick one of your family's favorite parts of summer--whether it's baseball,ice cream, or the pool--and have your child draw pictures of it or cut out pictures from magazines. Stick  the pictures onto paper to make a booklet and write text for it. When you're done,read the book together. Reread it whenever you like!\nKeep in touch. Kids don't have to go away to write about summer vacation. Even if your family stays home,they can send postcards to tell friends and relatives about their adventures . Ask a relative to be your child's pen pal and encourage them to write each week.\nKeep up the reading habits. Even if everything else changes during the summer,keep up the reading habits around your house. Read with your kids every day--whether it's just before bedtime or under a shady tree on a lazy afternoon. And don't forget to take a book to the beach!Just brush the sand off the pages -- it's no sweat!",
