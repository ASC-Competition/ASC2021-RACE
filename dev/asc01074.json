  "article": "All students need to have good study habits. When you have good study habits, you learn things quickly. You also remember them easily.\nDo you like to study in the living room? This is not a good place because it is usually too noisy. You need to study in a quiet place, like your bedroom. A quiet place will help you only think about one thing, and you will learn better. Before you begin to study, do not forget to clean your desk. A good desk light is important, too. It's good for your eyes if there is enough light.\n,.",
