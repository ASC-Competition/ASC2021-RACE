  "article": "In ancient Greece, Socrates was a great philosopher  , who was widely known for his wisdom  .\nOne day the great philosopher met a man, who ran up to him excitedly and said, \"Socrates, do you know what I just heard about one of your students?\"\n\"Wait a moment,\" Socrates replied. \"Before you tell me, I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Test of Three.\"\n\"Test of Three?\"\n\"That's correct,\" Socrates continued. \"The first test is Truth. Are you sure that what you are about to tell me is true?\"\n\"No,\" the man replied, \"actually I just heard about it.\"\n\"All right, so you don't really know if it's true or not,\" said Socrates. \"Now let's try the second test, the test of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about my student something good?\"\n\"No, on the contrary...\"\n\"So,\" Socrates continued, \"you want to tell me something bad about him even though you're not sure it's true?\"\nThe man shrugged  , a little embarrassed.\n\"The third test - the filter   of Usefulness,\" Socrates continued. \"Is what you want to tell me about my student going to be useful to me?\"\n\"No, not really...\"\n\"Well,\" Socrates said, \"if what you want to tell me is neither true, nor good, nor even useful, why do you want to tell me at all?\"\nThe man was ashamed   and said no more.",
