They walked!\nLater Columbus found the New World in 1492.At first,only a few Europeans followed.They traveled to America in boats.For the next 300 years,about 500 000 people went there.Then the number grew very quickly.From 1815 to 1915,over 32 000 000 Europeans left their countries for the United States.The biggest groups went from Germany and Italy.These Europeans spoke many different languages.Most of them took almost no money.They went to America to find a better life.",
