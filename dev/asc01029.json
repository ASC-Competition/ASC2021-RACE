  "article": "As young students, you have many dreams. These dreams can be very big, such as winning the Nobel Prize; they can also be small, such as becoming one of the best students in your class.\nOnce you find a dream, what do you do with it? Do you ever try to make your dream real? Follow Your Heart by Andrew Matthews, an Australian writer, tells us that making our dreams real is life's biggest challenge. You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that it is impossible for you to become a writer. Those kinds of ideas stop you from realizing your dream, the books says.\nIn fact, everyone can realize his dream. The first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. Don't let it leave your heart. Keep telling yourself what you want every day and then your dream will come true faster. You should know that a big dream is, in fact, made up of many small dreams.\nYou must also never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. But the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. You need to decide what is the most important. Studying instead of watching TV will help you to get better exam results, while saving five yuan instead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book.\nAs you get closer to your dream, it may change a little. This is good as you have the chance to learn something more useful and find new hobbies.",
