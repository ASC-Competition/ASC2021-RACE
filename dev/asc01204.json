According to the law , all children between five and sixteen must go to school on weekdays, and their parents must make sure of _ .\nThe number of children missing school is increasing. The government is worried, because, according to a research, children who often don't go to school are more likely to smoke, drink under age or do some other bad things. Also, it' s difficult for them to do well in exams. What's more, it's harder for them to get a job after they leave school. Since 2002,the police have kept checking town centers where truants often go. These happen twice a year. During each check, a student will be stopped and asked why they are not in school. This will happen even though they are with an adult. The police will stop and question children who they think do not have a reason for being out of school. The police are not allowed to catch truants, but they can take them back to school. The police said there were nearly twice more boys playing truant than girls.\n,. (5,2,10)",
