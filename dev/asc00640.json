  "article": "Body language is a very powerful tool of a communication, not only between people but in the animal world as well.\nIn many instances, we produce idioms which are all understandable by borrowing examples from animal communication.\nFor example, we know that a frightened cat will arch . From this starting-point we might hear the expression. \"He gets my back up!\" meaning \"He makes me angry.\"\nIn the same manner, we know that many animals, if challenged by attackers, will not turn and run away because this will encourage the attackers to attack them more forcefully. Instead, they will move backwards slowly to get out of harm's way, always facing their attacker. We call this action \"backing off\" and it can be used as well with humans as with animals.\nIn the case of humans, however, the back-off may not be physical but oral, as in using a kinder tone of voice and gentle words instead of fighting against the attackers.",
