  "article": "Look at this boy. He is an English boy. His name is Peter. His last name is King. This is his school. His school ID card number is five-five-four-three-seven-six-one-zero-eight-nine. His teacher is Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang is a good teacher. Henry is his good friend at school. Look! What's that? It's his backpack. It's black. But where is his watch? I don't know.
