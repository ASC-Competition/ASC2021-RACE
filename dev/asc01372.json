They happened to look up at the sky and saw a black cloud overhead.\n\"Ah!\" said one farmer, \"tomorrow we shall have rain and the rice will grow well.\" The second answered, \"Nonsense  , the rain will only kill the crops  .\"\nSo they began to quarrel  . Just then a third farmer came along and asked them why they were quarreling. Both farmers explained about the black cloud.\n\"What cloud?\" asked the third farmer. They all looked at the sky. The cloud was no longer there.",
