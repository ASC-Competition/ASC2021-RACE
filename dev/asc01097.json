  "article": "After a long day's study at school, you are very tired. So after school you go home to relax. When you get home, a robot _ you. He's happy to see you and helps you take your school things to your room. He listens to you talk about your school life and tells you a new joke. And he tells you to call your cousin and to say happy birthday. And then he helps you with your homework.\nThis is your future, and the robot's name is NAO. NAO has a small body, big eyes and a large head. He can walk and dance. He listens and talks, and he even learns and thinks for himself. His creators   predict that the robot will be in people's homes before 2040.\nThis $16,000 robot knows who you are. NAO can even express emotions  . He is a self-guided robot. A self-guided robot can sense  , think and act. Other robots might do two out of the three. For example, a robot might sense things using cameras and think using computers, but with no arms, he can't act. Another robot can move and sense things, but he can't think for himself. These aren't self-guided robots. But NAO can do them all.",
