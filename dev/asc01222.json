  "article": "One day in Overtown, Florida, 3.7 million dollars fell from the sky! It happened when a truck turned over. There was money everywhere! One man said, \"The streets were like gold.\" Some people took off their shirts and filled them with money.\nPolice officers went from door to door in the neighborhood. They asked people to return the money. After six hours, the total returned: zero.\nNo one in Overtown was surprised. Many people in this town are poor. They need the money to buy food for their children. They think that God sent the money to them.\nThe police say this is a serious _ \"People took thousands of dollars. It's not their money, and they have to return it.\" The police also say it's dangerous to keep the money because everyone knows the story from the news. People have money in their pockets and their backyards, and other people will try to steal it.\nSo far, only one person has returned some money. He is a firefighter. He found 300,000 dollars in a bag and gave it to the police. The people of Overtown still have the rest of the money.",
