  "article": "Here's one very simple but lifechanging advice that I first heard from Brian Tracy. Cut down on the TV at night by just one hour. Instead, use that hour to read books that could improve your life.\nIf you're a salesman, google for the best and most useful books on improving your sales.\nThis applies   to all fields, not just the work-related   ones. Maybe you want to improve your health, become a more energetic person. Or maybe you want to improve your study, your relations or perhaps do some personal development.\nOne hour a day is not much. But if you read for one hour a day on weekdays, that's about 260 hours a year. That's a large number of books and a lot of useful advice.\nIf you follow the ideas, who knows what great things and feelings could come into your life. Also, all that information and advice will start to open up your mind. You will start to see more chances in your life.\nNow, you might think something like this:\n1. I really don't have the money...\nAnswer: Visit your public library or search the database  . Or look for books that are used in places like amazon.com.\n2. I really don't have the time...\nAnswer: Buy audiobooks and listen to them in the car while driving to and from work. Or copy them to your MP3-player and listen while riding your bike /bus to work or school. Recently selling audiobooks through MP3-downloads has become popular...\nShut off the TV a little earlier and start reading.",
