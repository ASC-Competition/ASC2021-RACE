  "article": "One year, my school report made my parents angry. On Christmas Eve, all the presents were stolen, along with our TV. My parents told me that there were no presents because Santa was very angry with my behavior over the past year. The next year on Christmas Eve I slept downstairs with a plastic sword waiting for Santa to make sure that he didn't steal the new TV. The next morning, when I woke up, I saw Santa standing there. As soon as I saw that there were no presents, I grabbed my plastic sword and ran at him, shouting angrily: \"THIEF! THIEF!\"\nJack\nWhen I was young, we always had a specific room for the Christmas tree. My mom never really liked the location, so one year she moved the tree into another room. I was convinced that Santa would not know where the tree was and would get lost in our house. I was worried that he would be mad and put me on the \"bad\" list and would not give me any gifts because he couldn't find the tree. I came up with the idea to make signs leading from the fireplace to the tree. They said things like: \"Tree this way\" or \"Santa, put the gifts over here.\" When my big brother saw them he began to laugh his head off.\nLucy\nDoes everyone remember going to the mall and sitting on Santa's lap to have his picture taken at Christmas time?\nWell, I used to think that if I did that, Santa would get mad bcause he would have to go all around the world and give every kid the chance to have his picture taken with him. Of course his lap would hurt and he would be very fired. I thought he might keep a copy of the picture and that would be how he decided who would be on his naughty list.\nMy mom couldn't get me onto Santa's lap until she made him promise I wouldn't end up on his naughty list.\nLydia",
