  "article": "My cousin and I have very different living habits. I think I have a good habit. I take an active part in sports. After school, I often play ball games with my classmates. I don't like indoor activities. I'm hardly ill, and I haven't caught colds for years. I get up at the same time every morning and go to bed at the same time every night. I always sleep for nine hours each night, and I always feel refreshed   in the morning.\nMy cousin, however, has a very bad living habit. She never does exercise. She even hates walking to the bus stop from her home. She prefers indoor activities. She likes to play computer games and watch TV. She is overweight and often falls ill. She always goes to bed late and gets up at the last minute. She often feels tired in the morning.",
