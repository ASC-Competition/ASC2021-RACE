  "article": "It's not just gloves that can help people keep warm in winter. Love can, too.\nA pair of 16-year-old American twins, Jack and Jake Moran, stared a program called \"Warm Hearts, Warm Hands\" last month. Their aim was to collect new and used gloves with fellow students at Richards High School.\n\"We started this program a few weeks ago after we saw something on the news about a student who got frostbite riding his bike to school,\" Jack said. \"I just kind of realized that there are so many kids who don't have or wear gloves. The school has started the collection competition among classes, and the class that collects the  most gloves gets a pizza party.\nThe twin brothers talked to other students about their program. Many teachers also joined in, bringing in gloves and encouraging their students to help meet the needs of local community members.\n\"The conversations we are having now aren't so much about what actions we can take, but about _ .This program has really shown me that I don't need to get on a plane and go to help refugees to make a difference. I can do it right here. I can do it every day.\" Jake said.\nMore than 500 pairs of gloves have been collected in a month and more donations are coming in every day, including hats and scarves.",
