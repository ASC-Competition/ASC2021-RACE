  "article": "Take a look at the label  on almost any bottle of milk and you may see the word PASTEURIZED. What does that mean? Let's find out by meeting Louis Pasteur.\nLouis Pasteur was born in 1822 in a little town in France. As he grew up, he loved to paint. He loved to look at the world around him. When he went to college in Paris, he showed interest in looking through a microscope. A microscope makes things look a lot bigger; it lets you see things you can't see just with your eyes. Looking through a microscope, Pasteur found a living world in a drop of water. He saw and drew pictures of the small living things -- he called them \"microbes\" or \"germs\"-- that crowded in a drop of water.\nOne day a winemaker came into the lab, hoping that someone could help him with his problem. \"Sometimes my wine tastes delicious, but sometimes terrible,\" he said to Pasteur. \"Can you help me find out why?\"\nPasteur put some drops of the wine under the microscope. He noticed that the terrible wine had some unusual germs. If he killed these germs, maybe he could keep the wine from turning terrible. He tried with different ways to kill the germs. In the end he found heating   the wine seemed to work best. The winemaker tried it, and every bottle of wine tasted good.\nPasteur's idea worked for other people, too. When farmers heated milk, it didn't turn bad so quickly. When breweries heated beer, it tasted better. People called it \"pasteurization\" ---heating a liquid to kill bad germs. Aren't you glad that the milk you drink has been pasteurized?",
