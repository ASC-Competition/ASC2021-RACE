  "article": "If someone asks me, \"Do you like music?\" I am sure I will say, \"Of course, I do.\" I think music is an important part of our lives.\nDifferent people have different ideas about music. For me, I like rock music because it's so exciting. And my favourite rock band (  ), the \"Foxy Ladies\" is one of the most famous rock bands in the world. I also like pop music. My classmate Li Lan loves dance music, because she enjoys dancing. My best friend, Jane, likes jazz music  . She thinks jazz is really cool. \"I like dance music and rock very much,\" says my brother, \"because they are amazing.\" But my mother thinks rock is boring. \"I like some relaxing   music.\" she says, that is why she likes country music  , I think.",
