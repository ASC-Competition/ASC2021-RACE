  "article": "I arrived in the classroom,ready to share my knowledge and experience with 76 students who would be my English literature class. Having taught in the US for 17 years,I have no doubt about my ability to hold their attention and to impress on them my admiration for the literature of my mother tongue.\n    I was shocked when the monitor shouted, \"stand up!\" The entire class rose as I entered the room and l was somewhat confused about how to get them to sit down again,but once the embarrassment  was over, I quickly regained my calmness and admiration. I went back to my office with the rosy glow which came from a strong sense of achievement.\n    My students kept diaries. However, as I read them the rosy glow was gradually replaced by a strong sense of sadness.The first diary said, \"Our literature teacher didn't teach us anything today perhaps her next lecture will be better.\" Greatly surprised.I read diary after diary, each expressing a similar theme. \"Didn't I teach them anything? I described the entire Western  _ and laid the historical background for all the works we will study in class,\" I complained. \"How should they say I didn't teach them anything?\"\n    It was a long term, and it gradually became clear that my ideas about education were not the same as those of my students. I thought a teacher's job was to raise interesting questions and provide enough background so that students could draw their own conclusions. My students thought a teacher's job was to provide exact information as directly and clearly as possible. What a difference!\n    However, I also learned a lot,and the experience with my Chinese students has made me a better American teacher, knowing how to teach in a different culture.",
