Our town is small but it is nice and beautiful. Your son Tom can go to the sports center every day. He can play games and go swimming there. Jill  is also lucky. My son has a cat and two sheep and I have two horses. She can play with them all day.\nPlease don't worry. I'm sure you'll have a good time here. See you soon.\nBest wishes,\nLinda",
