  "article": "Changsha,\nHunan Province\nMay 6, 2010\nDear editor,\nUnder China's current   educational system, there are those who do nothing but study. They of course are thought to be model students.\nBut I feel that there is another type of student who, perhaps not as diligent   as the first type, uses his time more efficiently and achieves a lot academically.\nLast year, a classmate of mine was accepted by a top university. It surprised all of us. It was because, unlike most of us, he didn't spend too much of his time studying.\nWhen I asked him the secret of his success, he said that the key was properly and scientifically arranging his time.\n\" I spent a lot of time keeping fit and as a result, I was able to better concentrate   on my class work.\"\nThe moral   of the story is: it isn't necessary to sit at your desk all day long to get high academic   grades.\nYours,\nZhang Zishu",
