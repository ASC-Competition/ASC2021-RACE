After the music class, it's time to go to the computer room. The teacher teaches us some new computer games. Then it is time for lunch. There is an \"English Day\" in the dining hall, so we talk in English and eat English food. Then I have some ice cream. School food is really good. After lunch I go to the gym   for sport. A famous basketball player teaches us how to play basketball. I think I do it very well. But football is my favorite game. Then we go to the school cinema. We watch Jurassic Park   to help us with our homework on dinosaurs  . After the film it is time to get on the school bus to go home. I have some noodles after I get home. Then I do my homework and read Harry Potter. What a happy dream school day!",
