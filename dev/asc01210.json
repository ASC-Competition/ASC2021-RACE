  "article": "Mr. Brown's house was less than two miles from his office, so he could drive home every day for lunch. Every time he drove home at noon, he found many cars outside his house and there was no room for his own car. He had to drive somewhere else to park his car. Then he walked back home. This made him very angry.\nHe put up a board in the garden facing the road. The board said, \"No Parking\". But nobody noticed it. People seemed to obey only a police notice with white letters on a blue board:\nPOLICE NOTICE\nNO PARKING\nMrs. Brown asked his husband to steal a police notice but he was afraid to do so. Then she asked him to make one just like a police notice. Mr. Brown said he was not the police and couldn't use the word \"police\". Several days later, Mr. Brown made a blue board with white letters.\nPOLICE NOTICE,\nNO PARKING\n\"Oh!\" Mrs. Brown said. \"You told me you weren't going to use the word 'police', but why do you use it now?\" \"Really?\" he asked.\n\"Look again,\" she started to laugh. \"You are really clever\".",
