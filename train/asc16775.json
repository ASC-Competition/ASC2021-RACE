  "article": "One-hundred-and seventh birthdays aren't usually celebrated for authors who aren't alive anymore. But Theodor Seuss Geisel---better known as the children's books author Dr. Seuss ---who came into the world on 2 March, 1904, was an unusual man.\nLike generations of children I was raised on his wonderful stories. But when I now read them to my children it's not just the childhood memories I enjoy.

Seuss was ahead of his time, and in this book the dawn of concern for environmental problems are shown as the Lorax \"who speaks for the trees\" battles against an evil businessman who wants to destroy the forest and make goods \"which everyone needs\".\nIt's not only a warning of the heavy price of environmental destruction, written well before most people had thought to worry, but it's also a smart analysis of consumer societies: \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\" This is of course a moral message, but not of the kind designed to persuade the youngsters into behavior that adults want.\nI could go on, but hey, it's a birthday, and I'm sure you folks have some good toasts to raise for the party...",
