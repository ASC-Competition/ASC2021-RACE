  "article": "In England, afternoon tea is the most informal   meal of a day. It is taken between four and five. If you are a friend of the family, you may come for tea at any time. Very often it is not taken at a table. The members of the family and visitors take the tea in the sitting room. Each person has a cup and saucer  , a spoon   and a small plate for bread and butter   and cakes. By the way, do not help yourself to cakes first, bread and butter first, and then cake. Do remember: Though you can eat as much as you want, do not put more than  one piece of bread or cake on your plate each time.",
