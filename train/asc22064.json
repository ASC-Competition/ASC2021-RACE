  "article": "Raising pets is a popular online game among teenagers. \"More than 20 of my classmates have adopted  pets online.\" Said Wang Hui from Beijing.\nIf you go to some websites, you can adopt virtual  pets like penguins , chickens, dogs and elephants. You can feed, wash, talk to and play with your pet.\nDai Yingshuang of Shanghai said, \"It's great fun and I have also learned how to take care of others.\" She usually asks her uncle to take care of her pet while she is at school.\nIf you don't feed and care for the pet, it will become unhappy and unhealthy. So raising an online pet means spending a lot of time online. This makes many parents worried. They fear it will have a bad influence on the children's studies.\nWang Zhaotong from Anhui has raised a penguin since last year.
