  "article": "In New York there are quite a few free museums for visitors. Below we explore New York's most impressive free ones.\nNational Museum of the American Indian\nFocusing largely on Native American culture, this museum boasts over a million items, from crafts to traditional tools, all of which played a large part in Native American culture in past times. Located at 1 Bowling Green, the museum is free of charge. Open 10 a.m.~5p.m. Frid-Wed and 10 a.m.~8 p.m. Thurs, it's served by subway lines 4/5 to Bowling Green.\nFederal Hall\nA popular one for followers of American politics, Federal Hall is the original location of the US Customs House and the place where Washington took the oath of office in 1789 as the first US President. Today, this building is a premier example of classical architecture. Free of charge to visitors, the museum is located at 26 Wall St, which is accessible by subway lines 2/3/4/5 to Wall St. It's open from 9 a.m.~ 5 p.m. Mon-Fri.\nNew York Academy of Medicine\nFor the more intellectual, a trip to the New York Academy of Medicine is unmissable. With over 700,000 catalogued works, it's the world's second largest health library. Its biggest attraction, however, is the interesting medical equipment on display here, which is weird  but wonderfully original. Located at 1216 Fifth Ave at 103rdSt, it's free of charge to peruse. Open 9 a.m. ~ 5 p.m. Mon-Fri, it's served by subway line 6 to 103rdSt.\nMuseum at Fashion Institute of Technology\nThe museum contains a huge permanent collection which features 200 historically significant clothes and also features works by student exhibitions. With free talks and tours on offer, this museum is a great place without spending a cent. Located at Seventh Ave at 27the St by subway line 3, this free museum---undoubtedly the most fashionable one in New York --- is open Tues-Fri 12 a.m. ~8 p.m. and Sat 10 a.m.~ 5 p.m..",
