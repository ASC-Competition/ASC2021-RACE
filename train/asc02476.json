  "article": "Move over Psy. There's a new viral music video on the Internet that's getting millions of people dancing and laughing. Psy is a singer who created Gagnam Style, a music video which featured a catchy tune and interesting dance.\nThe new music video called The Fox (What does the fox say?) has recently gone viral. At     123 000 000 views, it may even catch up to Gagnam Style. The video asks the question, \"What does the fox say?\" It's a good question. And it seems, at least according to the music video, there is no good answer.\nActors in the video dress up like the animals they're singing about. One of the brothers dresses up like a fox. There is a surprising and silly dance in the video that takes the viewer a bit _ . The video's appeal is the song's simple rhythm and catchy chorus  .\nThe makers of the video never expected the video to do well or even to be taken seriously. In fact, it started out as a joke. The song was written by two brothers from Norway, Vegard and Bard Ylvis ker. The brothers have their own late-night talk show in Norway. They thought the video would be so bad that it would give them something to talk about on their show.\nOn their website, they say the video was \"supposed to entertain a few Norwegians for three minutes -- and that's all.\" But people started loving it. Some people say that once you listen to the delightfully silly song, you want to listen to it again and again.\nThe brothers have been guests on some major North American talk shows. They say they're happy about the success of their video, but they know that tomorrow something else could come along and be even bigger.",
