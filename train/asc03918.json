  "article": "Writers used to approach publishers to have their work read by the public. Now they can simply post them and find millions of instant audience.\nAfter breaking up with her boyfriend, Bao Jingjing started \"making up\" a love story simply to distract   her attention. Her story of a girl suffering the pain like hers progressed quickly, attracting many readers.\nWhen Bao stopped writing as she reunited with her boyfriend, she was urged to continue, as readers wanted to know what happened next. Bao finished it soon. It became so popular that it was turned into a best-seller. _ , Bao's novel was later adapted into a successful movie.\nBao's story is only one of many Internet novels that have landed deals for physical books, TV shows and films. Unlike traditional writers who buried themselves in their books for years, some young writers like Bao have got readers rapidly online and find overnight success.\nBao admits her success was unexpected. She still remembers how surprised her parents were when she proudly gave them her copyright earnings. Online literature forums are platforms for grassroots writers to succeed.\nIn recent years, Zhang Wei, known as \"Tangjiasanshao\", has earned 177 million yuan by his fingers though working as an author was beyond his dreams. He topped the list of wealthiest Chinese Internet novelists twice and was the only online writer to be listed on the 2014 Forbes \"Chinese Celebrity List\".\nHe admits that he is one of the few writers at the top of the pyramid while most online writers remain unknown. However, he urged that his success can be achieved by others, as long as \"they write hard enough\".",
