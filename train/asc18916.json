  "article": "There was a robbery at City Central Bank last yesterday afternoon. Two men entered the bank at about 4 p.m. and told the bank teller on duty to give them $ 1,000,000. The robbers were carrying guns  and wearing black masks  to cover their faces. The robbers told all the customers  in the bank to lie down on the floor. Witnesses  said that everyone in the bank was very frightened and did what the robbers told them.\nThe teller agreed to give them the money but told them they'd have to wait a few minutes. She said the bank manager would have to get the money out of the safety. As the robbers were waiting for the money. the teller tried to press an alarm button  that was hidden under the counter. It was a silent alarm, so the robbers didn't realize it had been set off.\nJust as the manager arrived with the money, ten police officers entered the bank. The robbers were very surprised that the officers caught them easily. The robbers are now in custody  , and will appear in court next week.\nPolice congratulated Miss Alston , the bank teller , on brave act. The bank manager said that he would give Miss Alston a week's vacation to thank her.",
