  "article": "\"My kids really understand solar and earth-heat energy,\" says a second-grade teacher in prefix = st1 /Saugus,California, \"Some of them are building solar collectors for their energy course.\" These young scientists are part of City Building Educational Program (CBEP) , a particular program for kindergarten through twelfth grade that uses the stages of city planning to teach basic reading ,writing and math skills , and more .\nThe children don't just plan any city . They map and analyze  the housing , energy , and transportation requirements of their own district and foretell its needs in 100 years . With the aid of an architect  who visits the classroom once a week , they invent new ways to meet these needs and build models of their creations . \"Designing buildings of the future gives children a lot of freedom,\" says the teacher who developed this program. \"They are able to use their own rich imagination and inventions without fear of blame , because there are no wrong answers in a future context . In fact , as the class enters the final model-building stage of the program , an elected \"official\" and \"planning group\" make all the design decisions for the model city , and the teacher steps back and becomes an adviser .\"\nCBEP is a set of activities , games , and imitations that teach the basic steps necessary for problem-solving ; observing , analyzing, working out possible answers , and judging them based on the children's own standards .",
