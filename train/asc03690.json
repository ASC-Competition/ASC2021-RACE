  "article": "\"Tiger Mother\" parenting raises media storm. A new book written by a self-described Chinese descent  on her super-strict parenting--Battle Hymn of the Tiger Motherhas raised media storm and fierce debates in the U.S.\nAmy Chua is a Yale Law School professor and the mother of two teenage girls. She is the daughter of immigrants of Chinese descent. In the Chinese culture,the tiger symbolizes strength and power. In her book Ms.Chua writes about how she demanded excellence from her daughters. For example,her daughters,Sophia and Louisa,were never allowed to attend a sleep-over,be in a school play,watch TV or play computer games. They couldn't choose their own after-class activities or get any grade less than an A.They had to play piano or violin--and no other musical instruments. She writes that if a Chinese child gets a B--which she says \"would never happen\"--there would be a screaming,hairtearing explosion\".She describes making her 7-year-old daughter play a piano piece perfectly--yelling and not letting her leave the bench even to use the bathroom--until it was.\nMany people have criticized Chua. Some say her parenting methods were abusive. She even admits that her husband,who is not Chinese,objects to her parenting style. But she says that was the way her parents raised her and her three sisters.\nStacy DeBroff,who has written four books about parenting,says Amy Chua's parenting style is not limited to Chinese families. She says it represents a traditional way of parenting among immigrants seeking a better future for their children. But she also sees a risk. When children have no time to be social or to follow their own interests, they might not develop other skills that they need to succeed in life. Stacy DeBroff advised parents not to just repeat the way they were raised.\nAlison Lo,an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Washington's Bothell campus said, \"I don't think Amy is advocating a best practice of parenting style, or that success and achievements are critical yardsticks  of a good life. But I can imagine how strong her daughters' college applications are going to be. For many parents whose dreams are seeing their kids graduating from a competitive university,Amy is sharing with the readers that it is achievable by persistent,dedicated parental guidance,\"Lo said in an interview with Julie Muhlstein,a columnist with the US-based Heraldnet.com.\"In that sense,a young adult's giftedness can be born,or made,\"Lo continued.",
