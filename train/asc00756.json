  "article": "Although the US is so big and its people have so many different racial backgrounds, it is in some ways less varied than Europe.The English language is used almost everywhere in its American form.The American way of speaking has developed independently of English and is on the whole closer to what can be heard in Ireland.\nAnother example of uniformity is in habits and ways of living.From Boston to Los Angeles it is as far as from France to Central Asia, and from east to west there are five time zones; but everywhere people get up and go to bed at about the same time, eat the same kind of food, buy in the same kind of shops, work and rest at the same time of the day and have the same pattern of holidays. _ there is less difference between rich people and ordinary people or between town and country, than in any single European nation.\nAlthough far more food is produced than the present population needs, America is actually an urban society.Less than a tenth of the people are engaged in   agriculture and most of the rest live in or around towns large and small.Here the traditional picture is changing; most Americans do not live in small towns any more.Half the population now live in some thirty metropolitan   areas.\nThe fact that the United States has always been a single economic unit has contributed to uniformity.Modern industry favors large organization, and it is no accident that the world's biggest commercial firms are American.The people can choose between the products of competing manufacturers   but the products are all much alike.",
