  "article": "A surprisingly high number of city citizens in China suffer from poor health and many die at an early age.\nPoor health with no sign of any identified disease, a condition known in China as \"sub health,\" is on the rise. Sub health is marked by general weakness, low energy levels and a poor immune system.\nA survey held in 16 cities with over 1 million population showed high proportions of urban Chinese have been suffering sub health problems.\nThe numbers are particularly high in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, with 75.31, 73.49, and 73.41 percent respectively of residents in poor health, the survey showed.\nThe problem happens mostly among senior and middle-level managers, clerks and other white-collar workers with high education levels, said the website of the Red Cross Society of China.\n\"The sub health condition, found in most cases among groups of people with a high educational level, will have bad effects on China's long-term development and progress if not dealt timely and properly,\" the website warned.\nA survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences shows that the average life of Chinese intellectuals is 58 years, 10 years lower than the nation's average.\nThis early death phenomenon may be increasing.\nAmong Chinese people with high education in the 25-59 age group, the death rate for women is as high as 10.4 per cent. For men it is even higher: 16.5 percent.\nA report published by the China Sub Health Academic Seminar said the country's health is going through a transitional period and many long-term diseases have taken the place of infectious diseases such as SARS and flu as the main cause of death.\n\"Bad working habits, poor disease prevention knowledge, not enough governmental investment and lack of health education are the main reasons,\" said Yang Xiaoduo, a healthcare expert with a local health association, who said China should race against time seeking measures to solve the sub health problem.",
