  "article": "A dog might be man's best friend, but my dogs are more like my kids! I think everyone should experience the unconditional love of a dog, but owning one is not for the nervousness. It's work--especially when it comes to the job of cleaning up their waste. When you clean up after your dogs, your neighbors will love you for keeping those smelly landmines out of their yards. But there are even bigger benefits. You'll not only be doing your part to keep bacteria out of your yard and neighborhood, you're also keeping harmful microorganisms away from the drinking water supply.\nThere are more than 77 million pet dogs in the United States and their waste is found in backyards, neighborhood parks, and the green areas that frequently line small waterways. When you don't clean up after your dog, heavy rain can carry bacteria from the waste into drains. Dog waste left in parks and other such places can be swept directly into nearby streams. This affects the quality of the water in our streams. These small channels often empty directly into our local drinking water supply or the water where we boat or fish.\nDog waste contains harmful microorganisms like roundworms that can be passed onto humans. This is why dog waste should not be used as fertilizer around your home. And it won't fertilize your yard either if you leave it behind like other types of fertilizer. Dogs don't eat the same kinds of natural material that cattle, horses or even elephants eat. The waste from those animals is actually beneficial for your yard and garden.\nYou should always pick up after your dog and throw the waste into the trash can. Some smaller cities might prefer the waste to be washed down the toilet, but in cities where there are many dogs, it's best to send the waste to the landfill.\nWhen you properly deal with your dog's waste, you'll be doing your part to keep harmful bacteria out of your yards, your neighborhoods and your drinking water.",
