  "article": "When a dog bites a man, it usually doesn't make news. However, this saying change when Beijing and several other Chinese cities announced the \"Civilized Dog Raising\" campaign in November.\nThe government will require Beijingers to get licenses for their dogs, and will enforce the one-dog, one-family policy. Police say the \"one-dog policy\" is aimed at reducing the number of dog bites and lowering the risk of rabies. According to the Ministry of Health, rabies has become the top infectious disease in China. Dangerous dogs and dogs taller than 35 centimeters, such as Great Danes, have been banned from urban areas.\nPet owners are also required to clean up their dog's droppings and make sure dogs are leashed  , especially in public areas. Some public areas, such as banks, are closed to dogs entirely.\nDogs are regarded as man's best friend and the history of raising dogs can be traced back to the stone age. It therefore seems sad that dogs are unwelcome in Beijing. But it is not the case that Beijingers dislike dogs. Actually, there are many dog lovers in Beijing. The city now has more than 550,000 registered dogs, up 20 percent from the previous year.\nThe problem is, actually, about living space. Different from many Westerners, most Beijingers live in urban apartment buildings, not houses in the suburbs. There is very limited open space for walking dogs. The barking, the waste, and unleashed dogs in buildings, elevators and places people gather can cause fear, fights and frustration.\nBeijing is not the only city to have a dog problem. Paris, London, New York and Vienna all face similar challenges and have common rules for dogs and their owners.",
