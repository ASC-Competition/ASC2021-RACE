  "article": "How to make friends\nChoosing friends\nBefore you make friends,you have to decide who you want to be your friends.Most people like to have friends who like to do the same kind of things as they do.That doesn't mean you have to be exactly like each other,just that you enjoy some of the same things.Think about your favorite things to do and try to talk to your classmates at lunch or rest about your hobbies.You are sure to find at least one person who's excited about the same things that excite and interest you,too.\nMaking friends\n*The quickest way to make a friend is to smile.When you smile,people think you are friendly and easy to talk to.It may not be easy at first to smile.But you can practice smiling in front of a mirror.When you look at yourself in the mirror,think if you'd rather talk to your smiling face or your usual scared or angry face.\n*One easy way to start a conversation with someone is to say something nice about them.Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you.Doesn't it make you want to talk to him?\n*Ask your new friends questions about themselves.It's the only way to get to know what they're like and it's the only way they'll know that you are interested in them.\n*Make sure you have something to add to the conversation,too.When someone asks you a question,do have an answer for them.There is nothing that will stop a conversation quicker than a shrug  for an answer.\nActivities\nAfter you've made a friend who shares the same interests with you,it's always fun to plan activities together that you'll both enjoy.Inviting a friend to your house after school is a great way to make your friendship closer.\nIf you know a game your friend likes to play,you can plan to do that together.When you play a computer game,one person is always left sitting with nothing to do but watch.Not fun.",
