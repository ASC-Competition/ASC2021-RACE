  "article": "With only fish and birds for company, Eric Erden has been rowing across the Pacific Ocean to Australia in his 23-foot-long boat since he left California on July 10, 2009.\nThis is the first part of Eric's trip around the world using only his own energy. He will row, bike, and walk without help from any motors at all. His plan includes climbing the tallest mountain on each of the six continents he visits, to honour the memory of a fellow climber.\nHe says he is doing this to show kids that they can achieve any goal, but he also hopes to have some great adventures along the way.\nStorms and huge waves regularly force him in the wrong direction and even threaten to overturn his boat. \"Sometimes I really feel scared,\" says a somewhat embarrassed Eric. \"But that's part of the journey. I knew this wouldn't be easy when I started.\"\nProtein bars give him energy, and he boils water to heat freeze-dried meals on a one-burner stove. A sun-powered machine removes salt from ocean water so he can drink it, but when that fails he sometimes tries to collect rainwater in a bucket.\nHe's not bothered by any of the hardships. Eric sees the world as a laboratory where there is much to learn. And when his trip around the world takes him across land, he enjoys meeting people -- especially children. He has already visited several schools and shared his story.",
