  "article": "I'm Bolivia Williams, a students at Bard College. I was the only person in my family who was Facebook friends with my mom, Rynn, when she died four years ago. At that time, my brother and sister were still young. As soon as we got the news that she died, I thought it would be an easy way to let everyone know what happened. Right after I posted the news, so many people offered their help and shared stories about her.\nI like to visit my mom's page to tell her things that I'm doing and I like to look at her pictures there. I sing with the Brooklyn Youth Chorus ,and we did a concert for the tenth anniversary  of 9/11,which was also my mom's birthday. It was an unforgettable day. I posted, \"You will be proud of me--I will sing at the site of the World Trade Center tomorrow. I know you will be looking down, smiling. \"When I'm writing to her, it feels like I'm still here.\nIn the beginning, I wasn't sure how to face my mom's death. But I've grown up now. I haven't been on my mom's page for a month, but I would miss _ if it were gone. Her page allows me to think that she's still here.\nI used to go to my mom's page to look at her pictures, which would make me feel really sad, Now, when I visit it, I smile more often than cry.\n,.",
