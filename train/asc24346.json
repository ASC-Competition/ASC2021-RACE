  "article": "How did your parents celebrate when you were born? Of course you can't remember, but they can. They have photos or videos from a ceremony of some kind.\nIn the United States, the proud parents of a new baby often put something on their front door. It's an exciting time for them, and they want to share the good news with their neighbors. For example, they put balloons on their door. Pink balloons mean the baby is a girl. Blue ones are for boys.\nPeople around the world often celebrate a new baby's birth with some kinds of ceremonies, perhaps a religious ceremony. This perhaps takes place when a baby is a few days or weeks old. Take what people do in Mexico as an example, many new parents dress their babies in special clothes take them to church.In some African countries, the family plants a tree near the house. In Korea, there is a traditional ceremony on the baby's 100th day. And it's the same in China. On that day, all family members and friends get together to have a big meal, with all the best wishes that the baby will grow up happily and healthily.\nThe parents of new babies often receive presents. In the United States, friends send cards, flowers or baby clothes. In China, family members and friends give money or presents.\nPresents, celebrations---these are great, but what do most new parents really need? More sleep!",
