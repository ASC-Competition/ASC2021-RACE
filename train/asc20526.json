  "article": "It was a Saturday in May. When Mrs. Black opened the door and looked out, she smiled and said, \"It's a beautiful day.\" She woke her small son up at eight thirty and said to him, \" Get up, Tod. Let's go to the zoo today. Wash your hands and face, brush your teeth and eat your breakfast quickly. We are going to New York by train.\"\nTod was six years old. He was very happy now, because he liked going to the zoo very much, and he also liked going by train. He said, \"I dreamed about  the zoo last night, Mummy.\"[:++Z+X+X+K]\nHis mother was busy, but she stopped and smiled at her little son, \"And what did you do in the zoo in your dream?\" Tod laughed and answered, \"You know, Mummy! You were there in my dream, too.\"",
