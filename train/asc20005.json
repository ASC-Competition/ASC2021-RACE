  "article": "Every year there is the Spring Festival in China. Usually it is in January or February . It is the most important festival in China. So before it comes, everyone has to prepare things. They buy pork, beef, chicken, fruit and many other things. And they often make a special  kind of food called \"dumplings\". It means \"come together\" in Chinese. On the day before the festival, parents buy new clothes for their children and children also buy presents for their parents. On Spring Festival's Eve, all the family members come back to their home. This is a happy moment. They sing, dance and play cards. Others get the dinner ready. When they enjoy the meal, they give each other the best wishes for the coming year. They all have a good time.",
