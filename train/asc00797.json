  "article": "Your genetic makeup plays a big part in determining your size and weight. If both your parents are tall, there is a good chance you'll be tall. But if your parents are smaller than average, you may want to rethink that professional basketball career!\nThe same goes for your body type. Have you ever heard someone say a person is \"big boned?\" It's a way of saying the person has a large frame, or skeleton . Big bones usually weigh more than small bones. That's why it's possible for two kids with the same height, but different weight, to both the right weight.\nBeing overweight can run in someone's family, but it may not be because of their genes. Poor eating and exercise habits also run in families and these may be the reasons the members of a family are overweight. And even though some kids gain weight more easily than others, when they eat right and exercise, most kids can have a healthy weight that's right for them. It's true- the way you live can change the way you look.\nHow much your weight is a balance between the calories you eat and the calories you use. If you eat more calories than your body needs to use, you will gain too much weight. If you spend you free time watching TV, your body won't use as many calories as it would if you played basketball, skated, or went for a walk. But if you eat more and exercise less, you may become overweight. On the other hand, if you eat less and exercise more, you may lose weight.",
