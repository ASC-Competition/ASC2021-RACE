  "article": "The book, Aliens Ate My Homework, is set in a small town in the United States. By the way the characters talk to each other and the description of items from their daily lives, I think the story takes place within the last 10 years. It is a story about a boy named Rod Allbright who goes to school like any other normal kid. Unfortunately, the class bully  always picks on him because he is overweight. While he's working on a school project for the science fair, tiny aliens  come, crashing through his bedroom window in a spaceship. They have come to the earth to get another alien, an evil one named BKR. He is known in other galaxies  for his cruelties. Rod gets bullied throughout the entire novel. The bully's name is Billy Becker, who is also called BKR! Rod does not discover that Billy is a bad alien until later on.\nThis book has lots of action and the main character is fun to read about. The most exciting part is when the aliens and Rod find out that BKR is Billy Becker and they skip school and go to search his house. They get caught when BKR comes home from school. He traps them in a storing device where he keeps his alien items. They break free of the device and escape from his house with some difficulty. Rod Allbright is fun to read about because he can never tell a lie. This gets him into trouble when the aliens eat his homework and he can't make up an excuse for the teacher.\nThe main idea that the author shares is that there could be other galaxies out in the universe with intelligent life forms who could be almost the same as humans. In this book, the aliens are just like humans in the way they think even though they look different and have a different language. I have learned that if you are nice to people they will be nice in return. This is proven in the book because Rod is nice to the aliens and they return the favor.",
