  "article": "Whether it's joining a school club, going to a friend's birthday party, or travelling by train, we can meet new people anywhere and anytime in our lives. However, many of us feel awkward when meeting people for the first time, especially when we aren't quite sure what to say. The situation feels cold, even icy.\n\"Breaking the ice\" is a term widely used in the English-speaking countries to describe a small talk technique that can help rescue a conversation from certain failure.\nSo where do you even begin? Well, a good start is to accept that it is perfectly normal to feel a little nervous when talking to someone for the first time. They might look _ or scary, but they could turn out to be the nicest person you've ever met.\nYou might think that breaking the ice is difficult. But sometimes just a simple \"hello\", followed by a three-second smile, can make all the difference.\nComplimenting someone on their garment or accessories  is also a great, easy way to break the ice. You might say: \"I love your jacket. Where did you buy it from?\"\nBeing in an uncomfortable or unpleasant situation with someone new might feel terrible, but it can actually be one of the best icebreakers. By focusing on the situation, you come together to fight the common enemy: the long bathroom queue, for example, or the overcrowded bus.\nYou can make observations too. \"What kind of drink is that?\" \"That's a lovely name. What does it mean?\" \"Do you study here too?\" There are opportunities all around you to ask questions that don't seem weird, as long as you have some follow-up questions in mind.\nIf you're feeling extra bold, make a joke. Jokes can be difficult to master but if you get them right, they show the likeable, witty side of your character. \"What's your name?\" \"Well, people usually call me Mike, but you can call me tonight.\"",
