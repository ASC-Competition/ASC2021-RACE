[:Zxxk.Com]\nHe asked excitedly, \"Will you please go home with me, my bird?\" Though the bird was also happy to see the old man, it shook its head.\n\"Take me to your home and let me see how you live,\" the old man said. The bird led the old man to its new home. And he found it lived well with many other birds. So he decided to go back. Before he was leaving, the bird gave him a basket.\nWhen he returned home, he told his wife what had happened. She opened the basket and saw a lot of gold.
