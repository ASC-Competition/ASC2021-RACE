  "article": "In England, we look forward to our birthdays for 364 days a year!\nWe invite special people to celebrate it with us.\nThe Presents\nPresents are opened as soon as the children are awake. They can't wait for the birthday cake later in the day!\nThe Cards\nFriends and family send birthday cards. Sending birthday cards is a custom   that began in England about 100 years ago.\nThe Party\nThe birthday child will have a party to which friends and family are invited. Visitors to the party bring presents for the birthday child. The children play games such as musical chairs and pass the parcel  .\nThe Cake\nThe birthday cake is decorated on a theme  . A candle for each year is lit and placed on top and the child blows out the candles making a wish. We don't put objects inside the cake as stated on many websites.\nThe Bumps  \nIt used to be traditional for the birthday child to have the bumps. Friends would hold the child by the legs and under the arms and lift the child up and down bumping them gently on the ground. The number of bumps given is the age of the child plus one for extra good luck. As this can be dangerous, clapping   is often done instead.\nThe Sweets\nSome children do take sweets to school to share with their classmates on their birthdays.",
