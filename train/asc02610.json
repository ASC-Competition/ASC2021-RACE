  "article": "Plenty of people dream of traveling to other planets. But \"Star Wars\" fans can actually visit locations where many of the films' most famous scenes were shot. Here are some of the places where \"Star Wars\" comes to life.\nHotel Sidi Driss, Matmata, Tunisia\nPerhaps the most famous \"Star Wars\" landmark in the world, this is where the interiors of Luke Skywalker's childhood home on planet Tatooine were filmed. Centuries ago, Berbers built the underground structure as a real home. Eventually it became a hotel, which George Lucas used to film the first \"Star Wars\" film. The set decorations came down when the crew left, but were rebuilt in 2000 for \"Attack of the Clones.\" Since then, they've remained, so guests can eat at the table where young master Luke did.\nLa Grande Dune, outside Nefta, Tunisia\nThe igloo  outside of Luke's house was filmed about 300 kilometers away on the dried-up salt lake of Chott El Jerid. The igloo is still there, reachable with a decent car at the GPS coordinates 33\"50'34. 42\"N, 7\"46'44.48\"E.\nThe surrounding hotels are man-made, to create the illusion  that the underground house is next to it. The igloo from the 1977 movie was taken apart, but again rebuilt for \"Attack of the Clones,\" and later restored by a fan. Nearby is La Grande Dune, site of the Dune Sea. About 30 minutes from the igloo is the set of Mos Espa, the spaceport town where Anakin was discovered as a young slave.\nRedwood National and State parks, California\n _ , the forest moon home of the furry Ewoks, was filmed among California's giant redwoods. Most of the well-known scenes were shot on private land owned by a lumber company. Since the cast and crew worked on \"Return of the Jedi\" in 1982, heavy logging has left most of the landscape unrecognizable. But driving through the parks still gives a feel for the set, especially along the Avenue of the Giants highway.\nIn Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park and the Humboldt Redwoods State Park, plates were filmed for some chase scenes.",
