  "article": "One day Robin went with his family to eat in a restaurant. They were sitting at a table and waiting for their meal. Suddenly, everyone around them started to cover their noses. Some of them even left their tables and went away.\nWhen Robin's family turned around to see what had caused this, they saw two homeless boys. The boys looked dirty and smelled bad. But both boys were smiling and had beautiful blue eyes. They were looking for someone kind. One of the boys went to the counter and he counted the coins he had. The other boy looked sick and he stood quietly.\nThe young lady at the counter asked the boy what they wanted. He said, \"We only want a cup of coffee. \" That was all they could afford. They wanted to sit in the restaurant and warm up. It was really cold outside. But to sit inside the restaurant, they had to buy something.\nWhen Robin's mother saw this, she wanted to help the boys. She ordered some more food. Then she went to the two boy's table. She put the food on the table. The boys looked up at her and said, \"Thank you. \" When Robin saw what his mother did, he understood what the unconditional( ) love was. His mother treated those boys kindly. She did not expect anything in return. Now Robin saves his own pocket money and helps homeless people whenever he can.",
