  "article": "German scientists say that eating a little chocolate every day may keep you away from cardiovascular  disease. The scientists have found that chocolate, especially dark chocolate , can help you cut down 39 percent of heart disease, including taking a very small amount . However, the study advises people not to eat too much chocolate, because too much chocolate is bad for our bodies. So the scientists advise people to eat small amount of chocolate instead of sugar or high-fat snacks.\nScientists said, \"Dark chocolate shows the greatest effects, milk chocolate fewer , and white chocolate no effects.\" The results showed chocolate may cut down blood pressure, but they also say that further study is needed.\nIn the eight-year study, people's daily diet, exercise habits, and blood pressure were studied in 19,357 persons aged 35 to 65. They found that people who are an average of 7.5 grams of chocolate a day had a very lower chance of heart disease than those who ate much less chocolate , and average of 1.7 grams a day.",
