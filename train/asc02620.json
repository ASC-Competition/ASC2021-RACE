  "article": "Most of us would like to have glowing skin, especially as we get older. The good news is that you don't have to wait until summer to catch some sun rays. Scientists have found eating plenty of fruit and vegetables is by far the best way to achieve a healthy, golden glow.\nDr. Ian Stephen said, \"Most people think that the best way to improve their skin color is to get a suntan . But our research shows that eating lots of fruit and vegetables is actually more effective.\"\nThe team first assessed the skin color of people in relation to their diet. Those who ate more fruit and vegetables a day were found to have a more golden, yellow skin color. Those with a healthy glow had a higher presence of carotenoids , which play a role in the immune system. Carotenoids are commonly found in fruit and vegetables such an yellow and red peppers, spinach, apricots and melons.\nThe team then studied the relation between skin tone and attractiveness. They used specialist software to operate the skin color on the images of 51 faces to simulate more or less carotenoids and suntans. Participants were then asked to adjust the skin color to make the faces look as healthy as possible. Given the choice between skin color enhanced by suntans and skin color enhanced by carotenoids, people preferred the carotenoids skin color.\nThe study shows that not only do people use skin color to judge how healthy other individuals are, but they are accurate when they make those judgments. While this study focus on Caucasian faces, it suggests this phenomenon may exist across cultures, since similar preferences for skin yellowness are found in an African population.",
