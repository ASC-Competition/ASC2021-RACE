  "article": "In China, if you are not married by the time you are 30, you are _ trouble: social blame and pressure from family and friends can get you down. And if you are a woman, it's even worse.\nMany young people get married simply to get other people off their backs   . This is a serious compromise. One ends up not marrying the ideal partner.\nThere are, however, a few young people who refuse to compromise: if they can't find a good marriage partner, they say, they would rather not marry at all.\n34-year-old Kate is a university lecturer in English. She said she would not describe herself as celibatarian   but simply a woman who hasn't come across the right man yet. She has sharp comments for the way in which the old generation looks at marriage.\n\"Many people think marriage is a duty---to your parents, family and society. Nobody cares if your marriage is happy or not, she said, I think this is very wrong and I intend to live and act according to my own will.\"\nHappily for her, her parents are open-minded and not lay stress on her. But the same does not apply to her friends. They are constantly trying to get her together with some young man or another. She always refuses politely.",
