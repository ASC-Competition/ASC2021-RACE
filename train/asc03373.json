  "article": "A teenager has gained a six-figure sum for a vampire   novel she wrote after being inspired by the Twilight. Abigail Gibbs, 18, who started writing the book aged 14, released chapters of her novel online, where the book eventually received 17 million hits. Harper Collins in Britain has now signed this talented author following her extraordinary Internet success.\nMiss Gibbs, from Brixham, Devon, who is about to start studying English at Oxford University, is the first author to be discovered on Wattpad. Wattpad is an online library which allows subscribers   to upload or read other people's stories. Miss Gibbs also said Stephenie Meyer's famous Twilight books had influenced her novel, The Dark Heroine. \"I read the Twilight and did really enjoy it. At first, my parents were a bit opposed to my writing because I was staying up till 3 a.m. on school nights and they were worried that I might fall behind.\"\nMiss Gibbs finished her book at the age of 16. She posted each chapter after she had written it on the Internet site, until she got to five chapters before the end when she stopped. \"I had signed with an agent and he basically said, 'Don't post anymore so as to keep the readers' anxiety\". That was tough because I disappeared in the site for a year and there were a lot of fans asking where I was. I have had so many requests from fans to upload the last five chapters; some people even said they were going to write their own endings.\" Her fans can buy the e-book for PS2.99, or wait for the paperback book priced at PS6.99 in shops next month.",
