  "article": "When the famous dancer Fred was interviewed for a job by a Hollywood producer , the movie Expert  turned him down, saying,\"Can't sing. Can't act. Dances a little.\" Here's another stupid mistake. When the great scientist Albert Einstein was at school, his teachers considered him rather dull. And a final story, the famous Polish pianist Paderewski was told by a teacher that he'd never be a success as a performer because the middle finger on each hand was too short.\nWhat lessons can be drawn from these three experiences?  First, true genius  cann't be suppressed .For some reason or other it works its way out. Second, early judgments of a person's abilities may be unfair or just wrong. Third, when there is a real determination to succeed, obstacles fall by the wayside.\nThe famous motto \"ad astra per aspera\" can be translated as \" To the stars through hardships\". Astaire, Einstein and Paderewski proved their critics wrong.",
