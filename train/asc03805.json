  "article": "A few years ago, a company called Space Marketing came up with a plan to send a mile-long advertisement into space. To advertising agencies  , it would have been \"a dream come true\". However, advertising standards agencies finally decided not to allow Space Marketing to go ahead with their plans and they were forced to give them up.\nSpace may indeed be the final place for advertisers, because on Earth we are already surrounded by advertising wherever we are and whatever we are doing. Apart from the obvious adverts that we see every day on TV, and in newspapers and magazines, there is a whole ' _ ' of advertising messages for our attention. There are ads that we see on the side of the bus we catch to work, for example. And what about the logos   we see on the clothing of the people we walk past in the streets?\nMost of the time, we are probably not even aware of   these less obvious advertising methods, but that doesn't mean that they don't work. Take 'product placement', for example. You are in a cinema, watching the latest Hollywood movie. Look carefully at the make of car your favorite actor is driving. And what about his watch? Can you see what brand it is? Chances are, you can, and the company that owns the brand is likely to have paid thousands for it to appear in the film.\nSo, whether Space Marketing finally succeeds in sending ads into space or not is perhaps less important than it might seem. This would not change a thing. Our everyday lives are already strongly influenced by advertising whether we realize it or not.",
