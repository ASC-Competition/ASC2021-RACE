  "article": "Being outgoing is good for your life. Those who are more outgoing like to meet lots of people and\nhave more fun in life. In fact, being outgoing is not as hard as you think. Even shy people can be outgoing. You can start becoming outgoing with your best friend or a group of friends. But the real challenge comes when you meet strange people or new friends. Smile more, and usually they will return your smile. In this way, you may have some talks.\nStart a talk. Just a smile \"Hello\" or \"How is it going\" is a good start. If you want to make interesting talks, you should read news in newspapers and prepare  your views, or surf the  Internet for new information and then keep that in mind.\nThe easier way to become more outgoing is to go out. This is also the most important step . Go to a park, beach, club, party or any other place that you think can be fun, and you may make new friends there.",
