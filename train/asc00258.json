  "article": "The phone ID flashed, \"Emergency Vet\". \"Oh no\" I whispered. I could not lose Merlin now.\nRon and I had tried to have children for a long time with depressing results. I threw myself into my work. Any maternal feelings I had were spent on Merlin.\nI couldn't wait to get home from work each night. I wanted to pick up that warm bundle of loving fur and nestle him. I wanted to sing \"Rock-a-bye Merlin\", as I did every night as he would put his paws around my neck.\nMerlin was my comfort especially at times when I wondered if God was listening. But last night something had changed. Not only did I sing \"Rock-a-Bye Merlin\", but I asked, \"What will I do after you're gone?\"\nAlthough Merlin was 19 years old, a senior in the age of a cat, he didn't look or act that way. I didn't want to accept the fact that he was nearing the end of his lifetime. My job at the law firm was so demanding and stressful that I couldn't imagine getting through the day without Merlin waiting to greet me at home.\nI dialed the vet's number. I asked for my husband but he already left. Then I took a breath and asked the question that no one wants to ask, \"Is my Merlin still alive?\" The nurse said \"yes.\"\nRon came home and said that Merlin had almost no red blood cells left. White blood cells were replacing them. Merlin would need expensive transfusions most likely on a monthly basis. We both knew Merlin was running out of time. I asked Ron to drive me to the vet so I could say goodbye to my little boy cat but he was beat tired and it was late. Ron said if Merlin was still alive the next morning then he would take me to the vet.\n _ Merlin had survived the night.\nAfter driving to the vet, I went into the examining room. The nurse brought Merlin and placed him on an examining table on his side. His eyes were tightly shut. I thought he died already. I carefully edged my hand to reach his body. His body felt warm, but when I spoke his name there was no response. No response to his name or that I was there and that I loved him. I was extremely sad.\nIn that examining room I felt helpless. I wondered how many people in an examining room felt as helpless as I did.\nFeeling driven to prayer I yelled, \"God this isn't good enough. I need to see my Merlin the way I remember him, I need a miracle and I need it now!\"\nAt that moment, God granted a miracle. Merlin's favorite compliment entered my mind. I said, \"Merlin, You are Beautiful and You are Gorgeous, do you hear me?\"\nOne eye opened.\nI said \"Gotcha\". I kept repeating those words.\nMerlin opened the other eye and, one limb at a time, got up. He was waiting for that phrase. He wanted to hear that he was beautiful and gorgeous again.\nThen I experienced another miracle.\nThere was no sound in that examining room until Merlin started walking to me. From out of nowhere, or maybe from heaven, I clearly heard a song we sung in church often: \"It Is Well With My Soul.\" I remembered thinking, \"Yes, it is well with my Soul. I got to see my little boy cat one more time.\"\nMerlin walked to me. He put his face in mine, which he had never done before. He rubbed a circle around my face twice. Merlin said goodbye with his face and marked me for life.\nRon appeared shocked that Merlin was up and had walked to me. I said to Merlin, \"Tell God you are a good boy and how much we love you\" and then handed him back to the nurse.\nTears of gratitude poured forth in memory of a miracle. You see for nineteen years God spoke to me through a special cat named \"Merlin.\" On Merlin's last day, God proved he heard me when he granted a miracle. That miracle gave me time to say goodbye.",
