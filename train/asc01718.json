  "article": "The moment a college student arrives on campus, he or she _ credit card offers. Advertisements for student credit cards are everywhere: in bags at the bookstore, in the campus newspaper, in your regular mailbox, in the residence halls.\nWith so many college students graduating with large amounts of credit card debt (figures vary, but most are at least in the thousands), learning how to manage a student credit card can be an important lesson for any student. While using a card wisely can be an important part of building credit and making it through a difficult time, knowing how to use a card wisely can be the hard part.\nStick to the following rules when, and if, you need to use a credit card:\nYou can repay the charge(s) within the card's next billing cycle.\nYou must meet your basic needs, like food, clothing and shelter, but set rules and be aware that you will need to repay those charges at the end of the month.\nYou can talk to the financial aid office in your school for an alternative in \"emergency\" situations.\nIf you do want a credit card, just be smart about it. (They let you in to that school because of your brain, right?) Don't automatically get the first one you find. Shop around for a card that has the lowest interest rate possible, and consider places that may not be advertising on campus. Additionally, be aware of any card's repayment options: When will payments be due? How much will they be? A credit card is not like a loan that comes with a grace period after you graduate and waits until you are done with school. That new sweater and nice dinner out will need to be paid back right away.",
