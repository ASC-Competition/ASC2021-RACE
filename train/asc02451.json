  "article": "I went shopping for a dress to wear to my daughter's high school graduation half a year ago. To my horror, I could only fit into a size 20.\nBeing overweight most of my adult life, I always had very little self-confidence. Wearing a dress I didn't like to such an important event was enough to make me look for help. Thankfully, a friend of mine was attending Weight Watchers meetings, and I noticed her great progress. Her success _ me to give it a try. I joined Weight Watchers, attended their meetings and started following their Weight-Loss System.\nI focused on the plan with determination and never missed a weekly meeting! I discovered that I enjoyed the benefits of having the help and support of others. I also read the weekly online e-newsletter and was inspired by the stories, recipes and information offered there, I also read magazines produced by Weight Watchers, which have great tips and new ideas in each issue.\nIt's hard for me to even remember the person I was before my amazing change. I didn't walk anywhere and couldn't wash my car or walk my dog. Today I do these simple tasks without even thinking about them. But the change didn't happen overnight. I had to exercise with patience and perseverance . I decided to take it one day at a time and stick with if for good.\nThe \"new me\" is more self-confident and healthier. I love how I feel now. I have more energy and feel like I'm 25 again. So why not give Weight Watchers a try if you have the same overweight problem?",
