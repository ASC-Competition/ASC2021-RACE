  "article": "It was May 5. It was Mary's birthday. She came home, and saw a card on the table. It said, \"There's a present for you, Mary. Go and look for it in your room.\" Mary ran to her room. Her parents were watching her. They were smiling. On her bed she saw a new red box. She thought, \"What's in the box?\" She opened it. There was nothing but a card in it. Mary took it out and read.\n\"Dear Mary, I'm your present. My first letter is in the word 'book', but not in 'look'. My second letter is in 'ink', but not in 'thank'. You can find my third letter in both 'ink' and 'book'. And my last letter is in 'she', but not in 'ship'. What am I?\"\nMary thought hard. B-I-K-E! She smiled and said, \"Aha, I know, Mom. But where is it?\" Her mother said, \"Look at the back of the card.\" Mary turned it over and read, \"Come and look for me in the garden.\"\nMary hurried to the garden. There under a big tree she found her present--a nice new bike!\n\"Happy birthday, Mary!\" her parents said.\n\"Thank you, Mom and Dad.\"",
