  "article": "Music is really powerful. Without music, movies would lose some of their attraction. No one disagree with the powerful effect music has on individuals. Whether this effect is positive or negative, however, often depends on the type of music listened to. And researches have shown that certain types of music own the ability to relieve one's anxiety, improve brain development in children, uplift one's memory and help patients to recover...just to name a few. \n    It should come as no surprise then, that researchers from the Tufts University have found that background music has the ability to directly affect one's eating habits as well. They counted the bites of food individuals took at meals while listening to different types of music. The diners \"ate at an average  rate of 3.9 bites per minute\", with about a third of the diners requesting more food after clearing their plates. On the other hand, with \"spirited tunes, \"the diners \"sped up to an average of 5.1 bites per minute! \"Not surprising however, when \"calming flute instrumental\" were played, the eating speed of the diners slowed \"to 3.2 bites per minute--and the bites became smaller\". They didn't request second helpings and praised that the food tasted better. \n  Studies have clearly stated that one safe way of losing weight includes eating slowly. Since it takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to tell the brain that it's full, eating slowly will help you to eat to satisfaction--without overdoing it. With this important piece of information then, it leads one to believe that with the use of calming background instrumental music, one can slow their food digestion, \"retraining\" both the stomach and the brain to take in less food which could lead to weight lost.     \n  Is there any truth to this theory? One will never know unless they try it themselves. Even if it doesn't work for you, at least you'll achieve a bit of relaxing and pleasant environment during your meal periods. A great meal with great music--who could ask for anything more?",
