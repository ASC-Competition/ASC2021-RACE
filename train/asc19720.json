  "article": "A group of frogs were travelling through the woods. Two of them, Nick and Jack, fell into a deep pit . All the other frogs gathered around the pit. When they saw how deep the pit was, they told Nick and Jack that they were as good as dead.\nNick and Jack ignored  what the other frogs said and tried to jump up out of the pit with all of their strength. The other frogs went on telling them to stop, and that they were as good as dead. Nick listened to them and gave up. Finally, he fell down and died.\nJack continued to jump as hard as he could. Once again, the frogs around the pit shouted at him to stop the pain  and just die. Jack jumped even harder and finally got out. When he was out, the other frogs asked, \"Did not you hear us?\" Jack explained to them that he was deaf. He thought they were encouraging him all the time.",
