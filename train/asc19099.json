  "article": "I am an American student. My name is Vicky King. I have a big family. I have two brothers. They and I are in the same school. My grandma and grandpa live with us. They are my father's parents.\nMy father is from England, but my mother's hometown is at the foot of the Great Wall of China. My brothers and I were all born in New York. Because my father works in a school in New York. He teaches English.\nPeople often ask us, \"What do you like eating?\" It is not easy to answer this question! Well, let me tell you.\nMy grandpa has been to India, so he likes Indian food. My father likes hot dogs, potato chips and hamburgers. My mother likes rice, noodles and dumplings. She often does very nice Chinese food for us. So my brothers and I like Chinese food a lot but English food a little. We don't like Indian food at all.",
