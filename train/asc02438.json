  "article": "My father suffered a disease once,  but he was an optimist .He wanted to dosomething to keep himself busy, so he became a volunteer at a children's h}pital. Sometimes oneor two kids would die. At this time he would tell the heart-broken parents of the children that hewould be with their children in heaven and that he would look after them there.\nThere was a girl with a disease that paralyzed her from the neck down. She couldn'tdo anything. My dad decided to help her with his true love. He started visiting her, bringingpaints, brushes and paper. He began to put the paintbrush in his mouth to paint. He didn't usehis hands. He would visit her whenever he could and paint for her. \"You can do anything onceyou make up your mind to do it,\"he said. Finally, she began to paint using her mouth, too.\nLater, my dad recovered and returned to work. He worked at the volunteer counter in thehospital. One day, he noticed the front door open. In came the little girl who had been paralyzed.\nShe was walking! She hugged my dad tightly and gave him a picture she had done using herhands. At the bottom it read: \"Thank you for helping me walk again!\"\nAfter that my father often said love was more powerful than doctors.",
