  "article": "Recently I met a former student Jeanie, for lunch. She had been one of my sixth grade students. Before she had moved away, I had been asked to speak as someone who had been a motivator. I spoke telling the crowd gathered that she was a blessing and encouragement to me. She was a child that had come from a family with some problems. When we finally met, she told me that the thing that made me her favorite teacher was the speech I gave every year. I tell my students that when they wake each morning and come to school, they spend more time with me than they spend with their parents. They may be in the same house, but that does not mean that they spend time with them. I told them that my job was to teach them, comfort them, encourage them, and discipline them as needed. However, my most important job was to love them so that they could put away all other thoughts and prepare to learn. I have no losers in my class. They should therefore consider me their mom away from home.\nOver lunch, Jeanie asked if she could have the honor of calling me \"Mom\", because over the years _ She said she has heard from many friends and this is what they all remember about me  That I was not only their teacher, but their mom; someone to comfort them, guide them and teach them.",
