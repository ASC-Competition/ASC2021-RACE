It seriously affects their ability to study, so do their test results. If so, use these tips to help you.\n _ \nYou should always study in the same place.

If your study desk or table is needed when you are not studying, store all your equipment in a box beside _ \nYour eyes will become tired if you try to read a text which is on a flat surface. Position your book at an angle of 30 degrees.\nBe realistic and don't try to complete too much in one study period. Finish one thing beforebeginning another. If you need a break, get up and walk around for a few minutes, but try not to telephone a friend or have something to eat.\n _ \nAll your hard work will be for nothing if you are too nervous to take your test. Getting plenty of rest is very important. This means: do not study all night before your test! It is a better idea to have a long-term study plan. Try to make a timetable for your study which lasts for a few months.\nExercise is a great way to reduce pressure. Doing some form of exercise every day will also improve your concentration. Eat healthy food, too.\nWhen you arrive in the examination room, find your seat and sit down. Breathe slowly and deeply. Check the time on the clock during the test, but not too often. Above all, take no notice of everyone else and give the test paper your undivided attention.",
