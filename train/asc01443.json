  "article": "It's you and I who are to blame for the state of the earth. No question about it. It's our life-style that is threatening life on Earth, so we must make the changes. The good news is that many of those changes are really quite simple, even enjoyable, but for every careful step we take as individuals , we must press government and industry to take a big step on our benefit . And we must start now. Tomorrow's too late.\nMy aim this year is to persuade as many of my friends and colleagues as possible to choose the train, and leave their cars behind too. My gardens have been pesticide -free zones for years and I enjoy seeing more wildlife on my doorstep as a result; I've tried to reduce my contribution to water pollution too, by using environment-friendly, phosphate -free washing powder , and by no longer thinking of the toilet as a suitable waste-disposal  point .\nI ran after a young lady through town recently to give her back the piece of paper she had carelessly thrown away. She disappeared into a shop, and when I followed her inside and made my presentation, she was doubly embarrassed--she worked there, and the boss gave her a ticking-off too. I've started asking fellow drivers at gas stations why they aren't using unleaded   petrol . These are small things, but we have to start somewhere, and every little does help .",
