  "article": "The teacher was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry.  The miller at Cresscombe lent him the small cart and horse to carry his goods to Christminster, the city of his destination, such a vehicle proving of quite enough size for the teacher's belongings.  For his only article, in addition to the packing-case of books, was a piano that he had bought when he thought of learning instrumental music.  But the eagerness having faded, he had never acquired any skill in playing, and the purchased article had been a permanent trouble to him.\nThe headmaster had gone away for the day, being a man who disliked the sight of changes.  He did not mean to return till the evening, when the new teacher would have arrived, and everything would be smooth again.\nThe blacksmith, the farm bailiff and the teacher were standing in confused attitudes in the sitting room before the instrument.  The teacher had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should not know what to do with it on his arrival at Christminster, since he was only going into a temporary place just at first.\nA little boy of eleven, who had been assisting in the packing, joined the group of men, and said, \"Aunt has got a fuel-house, and it could be put there, perhaps, till you've found a place to settle in, sir.\"\n\"Good idea,\" said the blacksmith.\nThe smith and the bailiff started to see about the possibility of the suggested shelter, and the boy and the teacher were left standing alone.\n\"Sorry I am going, Jude.\" said the latter gently.\nTears rose into the boy's eyes.  He admitted that he was sorry.\n\"So am I,\" said Mr. Phillotson.\n\"Why do you go, sir?\" asked the boy.\n\"Well ----- don't speak of this everywhere.  You know what a university is, and a university degree?  It is the necessary hallmark of a man who wants to do anything in teaching.  My scheme, or dream, is to be a university graduate.  By going to live at Christminster, I shall be at headquarters, so to speak, and if my scheme is practicable at all, I consider that being on the spot will afford me a better chance.\"\nThe smith and _ returned.  Old Miss Fawley's fuel-house was practicable; and she seemed willing to give the instrument standing-room there.  So it was left in the school till the evening, when more hands would be available for removing it; and the teacher gave a final glance round.\nAt nine o'clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books, and waved his friends good-bye.",
