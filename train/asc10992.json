  "article": "One night when my wife was preparing dinner, our little son took a piece of paper to her which read:\nFor washing the car .........................................................$5.00\nFor making my own bed this week ....................................... $1.00\nGoing to the provision shop ................................................$0.50\nPlaying with little sister......................................................$0.25\nTaking out the rubbish....................................................... $1.00\nGetting a good report card................................................ ..$5.00\nAnd for sweeping the common corridor................................... $2.00\nTotal........................................................................... $14.75\nHis mother looked at him standing there expecting payment. I could see a thousand memories flashed through her mind. So she picked up the pen and turning the paper over, this is what she wrote : \nFor nine months I carried you, growing inside me .................. No Charge\nFor the nights I sat up with you, doctored and prayed for you......No Charge\nFor the toys, food and clothes and wiping your nose ................No Charge\nWhen you add it all up, the full cost of my love.......................No Charge\nWell, when he finished reading, he had big tears in his eyes. He looked at his mother and said, \"Mummy, I love you.\" Then he took the pen and in great big letters wrote on the \"bill\" \"All paid.\"",
