  "article": "The Smurfs --cute little blue cartoon dwarfs inspired by Nordic fairy tales made their first TV appearance in the US in 1981 and ever since have been childhood friends to many people across. The storyline is quite simple. The Smurfs are living happily in their mushroom houses in the middle of a forest.Then one day the evil wizard Gargamel discovers their village and sends them by magic to present-day New York City. The Smurfs have to find their way home and conquer Gargamel along the way.\nSo, just why, more than half a century later, is the simple story still so beloved by young and old? Mario Cacciolotto, a BBC reporter, believes it is due to the fact that the Smurfs' lives do not have any particular cultural implication and argues that they could offer a model for society.\nVeronique Culliford, daughter of the Smurfs' creator Pierre Culliford, agrees.\"They are unique creations,\" she says, \"They do not do politics or religion.They are multi-cultural and everybody around the world can recognize themselves in the Smurfs.Everyone can apply their very nice values of friendship, kindness and helping others to their own lives, regardless of where they come from\".\nIn the Smurf world , everyone has their own skill and is willing to use it for the benefit of others without expecting any reward.Their village is run as a collective and has no form of currency. This has even led to debates about whether the artist intended the Smurfs as a metaphor for socialism. \"The series wasn't just about sweet-looking dwarfs,\" said Alan Mechem of the British Smurf Collectors Club.He thought that Culliford wanted it to show things like equality and tolerance.",
