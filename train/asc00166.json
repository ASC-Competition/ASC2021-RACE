  "article": "I was 18 when Tim and I began to date. Shy and quiet, I'd met his parents once before but hadn't ventured to say more than \" Hello\". This particular evening, however, we were taking them out to dinner for their anniversary and I wanted to make a good impression.\nTim and his parents arrived and I was out the door in a flash. My good impression began with \" punctual\". I sat in the backseat beside Tim nervously watching his father's eyes glance into the rearview mirror to examine me.\nTim and his parents had already decided on their favorite Mexican restaurant and that was fine with me; the dim lighting would hide the rising flush of my cheeks, and if anyone noticed, I could blame it on the peppers. With proper table manners I managed to survive halfway through dinner without making any unforgivable mistakes. However, in the midst of conversation I reached for my iced tea, raised the glass to my lips and very quickly discovered I had picked up the wrong glass.\nI quickly lowered the glass and set it back but it was too late; I had burnt my eyebrows, the hair in my nose, and curl over my forehead! I looked up slowly, praying no one had seen me, but all eyes at the table had seen and each face stared at me in shocked silence. Excusing myself, I ran to the restroom.\nI would have hidden there forever but I'd barely gotten in the door when Tim's mother arrived. \" Ah, honey,\" she said, holding out her arms to me. \" Everything will be just fine.\"\nTim and I eventually married. We had a small ceremony and a family reception afterwards held at the very restaurant where this incident occurred. This time, however, I didn't drink any candles... only a Margarita ; they were served in different glasses.",
