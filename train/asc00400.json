  "article": "Hidden in our subconsciousness   is a perfect mental picture. We see ourselves on a long trip that goes across the continent. We are traveling by train. Out the windows, we think in the passing scene of cars on nearby highways, of children waving at a crossing, of cattle feeding on a distant hillside, of smoke pouring from a power plant, or row upon row of corn and wheat, of flat lands and valleys, of mountains and rolling hills, of city skylines and village halls.\nBut uppermost in our minds is the final destination. On a certain day at a certain hour, we will pull into the station. Bands will be playing and flags waving. Once we get there, so many wonderful dreams will come true and the pieces of our lives will fit together like a completed jigsaw  puzzle. How restlessly we pace the aisles , condemning the minutes for loitering --waiting, waiting, waiting for the station.\n\"When we reach the station, that will be it!\" we cry. \"When I'm 38.\" \"When I buy a new 450SL Mercdes Benz!\" \"When I put the last kid through college.\" \"When I have paid off the loan!\" \"When I get a promotion.\" \"When I reach the age of retirement, I shall live happily ever after! \"\nSooner or later, we must realize there is no station, no one place to arrive at once and for all. The true joy of life is the trip. The station is only a dream. It constantly outdistances us.\n\"Relish(appreciate) the moment\" is a good motto, actually it isn't the burdens of today that drive man mad. It is the regret over yesterday and the fear of tomorrow. Regret and fear are twin thieves who rob us of today.\nSo stop pacing the aisles and counting the miles. Instead, climb more mountains, eat more ice cream, swim more rivers, watch more sunsets, laugh more and cry less. Life must be lived as we go along. Then the station will come soon enough.",
