  "article": "It seems that school children all over the world complain   about their school food. What do students of your age eat for lunch at school in other countries?\nJapan\nHigh schools have dining rooms. They serve everything from noodles to rice, but not burgers and chips. Other children bring food from home, such as cold rice balls, meat or fish, pickles   and vegetables. Twice a year parents are invited to have a taste of the food.\nUnited States\nA typical menu from a US school is made up of a hamburger with fried potatoes or roast chicken, lettuce and pickles, fruit and cookies. School lunches must also provide at least one third of the daily amount   of necessary nutrition  , such as,  vitamin A, vitamin C and calcium  .\nAustralia\nMeat pies, sausage rolls   and hotdogs are all traditional dishes in Australian school shops. But as the country pays more attention to children's health, healthier foods have started to appear on school menus. Many schools have used a traffic light system. The sale of red labeled c) foods, including cookies, chocolate and soft drinks. Is served only twice a week. Healthier green labeled foods such as sushi, sandwiches, corn and watermelons, however, are available every day.\nSouth Africa\nMost of South African schools do not serve meals at all. Classes end at l; 30 p. m. and students get their own lunches. Many students bring food from home, usually sandwiches.\nFast food and fried food sell the best among students. As a result, it has caused a rise in obesity c) among children. But as more people began to realize that being too fat may cause different kinds of serious illnesses, some schools in towns have led the way towards better nutrition. Now students at these schools are offered lunches of porridge with vegetables, such as cabbage, onions, beans, carrots and tomatoes.",
