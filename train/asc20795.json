  "article": "A person's nose is important for breathing and smelling. The nose is also used in many popular expressions.\nSome people are able to lead other people by the nose. For example, if a wife leads her husband by the nose, she makes him do whatever she wants him to do.\nSome people are said to be hard-nosed. They will not change their opinions easily. And many people will never pay through the nose, that is, they will not pay too much money for something.\nIt is always helpful when people keep their nose out of other people's business.The opposite of this is someone who noses around all the time. This kind of person is interested in other people's private matters. He is considered nosy.\nAnd my teacher often says, \"If you put your heart into it, the answers should be right under your nose. \" It means something can be found or seen easily.\nAs for ear, there are also some expressions.\nWhen I want to say something to you, I hope you are all ears and listen carefully. I also advise you to keep your ear to the ground. This means to be interested in what is happening around you and what people are thinking.\nAnother expression about ear is to play it by ear. Someone is able to play a song or a piece of music by remembering the tune  and not by reading the music.\nThere are many other expressions about different parts of our body.\nFor example, if someone is playing a joke on you, you can say, \"You are pulling my leg. \" And to turn your hand to something means to begin to do something. If a child does something wrong, we say he will get it in the neck, or he will be punished.",
