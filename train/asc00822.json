  "article": "Jamaican sprinter   Usain Bolt plans to send a message to rival Tyson Gay by breaking the world 100m record in the London Grand Prix on Friday.\nBolt, who won gold in the 100m,200m and 4*100m relay in reord times at the Beijing Olympics last year, is determined to use the Crystal Palace event to crush the morale    of his main rival for gold at next month's World Athletics Championships in Berlin.\nThe 22-year-old is slowly returning to peak form after posting 19.59 sec for the 200m in Lausanne earlier this month and clocking a time of 9.79 sec over 100m in cold, rainy conditions in Paris on Friday.\nDespite Bolt's impressive times, Gay still believes he has the beating of the Jamaican. But Bolt insists there is no one in the sport who scares him and he will prove the point in south London this weekend.\nAlthough Bolt believes he is only running at 85 percent at the moment while he recovers from injuries suffered in a recent car crash in Jamaica, he sees no reason why he can't break his world record 100m time of 9.69 seconds.\nHowever he won't get the chance to _ Gay in the 100m in London as the American is only running in the 200m, which Bolt is not competing in, so he will have to settle for underlining his own ability.\n\"You never know what is possible. I will give my best either way. My friends are saying I'm bringing the rain wherever I go but we will see on Friday.\"\nWhile Bolt would love to make a big impact in London, he knows the main event is the World Championships.\n\"The London Grand Prix will show me where I'm at and what I need to do. After, we can analyse what I need to do ahead of the World Championships.\"",
