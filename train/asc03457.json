  "article": "Archaeologists  studying Stonehenge and its surrounding area say they've dug up the relics of an untouched, ancient campsite that dates back to 6,000 years--a find that could rewrite British prehistory.\n\"This is the most important discovery at Stonehenge in over 60 years,\" Professor Tim Darvill, a Bournemouth University archaeologist and a Stonehenge expert who did not take part in the new discovery, told theTelegraph. And as he told The Huffington Post in an email, the discovery changes earlier theories that Stonehenge was built in a landscape that was not heavily used before about 3000 B.C.\nThe discovery was made during a dig at Blick Mead, a site about 1.5 miles from Stonehenge. Researchers found charcoal dating back to 4,000 B.C. and evidence of possible buildings, according to a statement released by the university. They also dug up burnt stone and tools, as well as the remains of animals--ancient cattle that served as food for ancient hunter-gatherers.\nThe researchers plan further analysis on theartificial objects but say they're worried the tunnel construction   could damage the site and get in the way of their work.\n\"Blick Mead could explain what archaeologists have been searching for centuries--an answer to the story of Stonehenge's past,\" David Jacques, the University of Buckingham archaeologist who discovered the campsite, toldThe Guardian. \"But our only chance to find out about the earliest part of Britain's history could be ruined if the tunnel goes ahead.\"\nStonehenge, a prehistoric monument made up of a ring of standing stones, lies eight miles north of Salisbury, England in Wiltshire. It has been listed as a World Heritage Site since 1986.",
