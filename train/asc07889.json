  "article": "A trucker relates that he was traveling through rural North Carolina on I-95 when a brown car combined onto the highway. It came back and forth between lanes, causing the driver of the truck to change into a lower position. At first he thought the driver was drunk, but when he came closer, the trucker saw an old man shaking uncontrollably behind the wheel. He noticed a Citizen's Band aerial shaking to and fro as the car pulled suddenly between lanes, so he called on the radio: \"You in the brown Chevy, if you can hear me, pull over.  Pull off the road!\"\nAmazingly, he drdf The trucker pulled up behind the car and climbed from his cab . The elderly man staggered from his auto and fell into the trucker's arms. He poured out a story of months of fear and pain that accompanied the illness of his only daughter.\nNow he was returning from the hospital where it was decided that she would stop any further treatment. In the hospital he remained \"strong\", but out on the road he fell apart.\nThe two men talked for the good part of an hour. The father eventually decided to share his pain with his ciaughter and said he felt good enough to drive home. The men embraced and the trucker followed him for 50 miles. As they drove along, the two talked together on the radio.\nThe older man finally acknowledged that his exn was ahead and thanked his new friend again for the help. The trucker asked if he could make it home all right and, suddenly, a third voice broke in on the conversation: \"Breaker 19, cjon't worry, good buddy. Go your way. I'll see him home\" Glancing in his mirror, he saw another truck move into the exit lane behind the brown car.\nI think there are good people the world over. People who will gladly give that caring touch, a needed warm embrace or a patient and listening ear. They are like angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly.",
