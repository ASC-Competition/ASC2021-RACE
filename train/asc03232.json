  "article": "When I was about ten years old, I was walking down the street with my mother. She stopped to speak to Mr. Lee. I knew I could see Mr. Lee any time around the neighborhood, so I didn't pay any attention to him. After we passed Mr. Lee, my mother stopped me and said something that has stuck with me from that day until now. She said seriously, \"You let that be the last time you've ever walked by somebody and not opened up your mouth to speak, because even a dog will wag its tail when it passes you on the street.\" Mother's words sound simple, but it's been a guidepost for me and the foundation of who I am.\nIt's not just something I believe in; it's a way of life. I believe that every person deserves to feel someone acknowledge their presence, no matter how humble   they may be.\nAt work, I always said hello to the founder of the company and ask him how our business was doing. But I also spoke to the people who cleaned the buildings and asked how their children were doing. After a few years of greeting the founder, I had the courage to ask him for a meeting. We had a great talk. At a certain point I asked him how far he thought I could go in his company. He said, \"If you want to, you can get all the way to this seat.\"\nI've become vice president, but it hasn't changed the way I approach people. I still follow my mother's advice. I speak to everyone I see, no matter where I am. I've learned that speaking to people creates a pathway into their world, and it allows them to come into mine, too.",
