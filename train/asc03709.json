  "article": "Parents have widely different views on the problem of pocket money . Four new fathers were asked this question and this is how they answered .\nAshish Khanna :Although many argue that pocket money helps develop children's sense of value , I don't agree . I wouldn't give my child any pocket money . First of all , I never got pocket money and I seem to have a good value for money . If my child ever needed something and I felt it was areasonable request , I would buy it for him .\nSharad Sanghi : No , I wouldn't give my child pocket money because I don't want to create theperception  of \" her \" money and \" my \" money . Besides , if I refuse to buy her something that I think is bad for her , she may buy it with her pocket money _ . In this way , I would lose control over my child's requests . I feel it also encourages children to care more about money than anything else . I don't want my child to start judging other children by the amount of money or pocket money they have .\nRakesh Shah : Yes , I would give my child pocket money . I feel that children should learn to spend money intelligently and not go overboard spending . They will learn what theirlimitations are and feel the difficulty when they have to pay for something that is over in their own pockets .\nRajiv Patel : Yes , I would give my child pocket money because it is important that she learns to manage money . I will give her a fixed amount every month and if she spends the money before the month is over , then she will learn a lesson and not spend money so freely .\nVikram Desai : Yes , I would certainly give my child pocket money . But I would not give it to him on a weekly or monthly basis . He would have to earn it . If he helped me finish some of my jobs or helped his mother with housework , I would reward him . This helps him realize that \" money does not grow on trees \" and it requires hard work to earn money .",
