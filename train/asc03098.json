  "article": "An elderly couple lived far away from their children. They noticed that they were beginning to forget many little things around the house. They were afraid that this could be perilous, as one of them might forget to turn off the stove and thus cause a fire. They were so worried that they decided to see their doctor to get some help. Their doctor told them that it was unnecessary to take medicine and that many people of their age found it useful to write themselves little notes as reminders. The elderly couple thought this wonderful, and left the doctor's office very pleased with the advice.\nWhen they got home, the wife said, \"Dear, will you please go to the kitchen and get me a dish of ice cream? And why don't you write that down so you won't forget?\"\n\"Don't be silly,\" said the husband. \"I can remember a dish of ice cream!\"\n\"Well,\" said the wife, \"I'd also like some strawberries on it. You should write that down, because I know you'll forget.\"\n\"Come on, my memory's not that bad,\" replied the husband. \"A dish of ice cream and some strawberries. I can remember that!\"\nAnd with that, the husband shut the kitchen door behind him. The wife could hear him getting out pots and pans, and making some noise, preparing the dish. He came out of the kitchen about 15 minutes later.\nWalking over to his wife, he presented her with a plate of fried eggs. The wife took a look at the plate, glanced up at her husband and said, \"Hey, where's the toast?\"",
