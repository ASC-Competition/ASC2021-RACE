  "article": "I am sure we've all come across inspiring quotes that made us nod in agreement or made us think, \"Wow, that's good quote\".But we end up going back to procrastinating   on whatever it was we were procrastinating on.So are these inspirational quotes even worth reading? Well, that depends.\nQuotes, books, articles, audio programs... all of these things are just tools and they're only effective when you use them.I don't know about you but most quotes I read don't do anything for me.However, every now and then, I will come across one that will positively affect me in some way such as reminding me to be grateful, getting me to work out extra hard at the gym without being pressed by my wife, or never give up when things get tough.\nFrom my experience, reading quotes is more effective when you're actually trying to motivate yourself rather than just reading them for the sake of reading them.The second you feel the urge to take action, you'd better immediately get up off your chair and take action.\nThese quotes aren't for everyone.If you have read tons of them and have never been motivated or had a positive change in the way you look at life or how you treat others, or these quotes don't help you to insist on doing something when you feel like giving up on it, then it's probably not worth your time reading more of them.If you have done something a bunch of times and it's not giving you the results you want, don't keep doing it.Try something else.\nNow if you've found some value in reading these quotes in the past, continue to make them more effective by letting them guide your life.\nI'll end this text with one of my favorite quotes, which reminds me to constantly examine my habits.\"We are what we repeatedly do.Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.\"---- Aristotle",
