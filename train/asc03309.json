  "article": "Having learned much about the War of Resistance against Japan, Mao Jingxin didn't like the Japanese when she was a child. \"I thought they were cruel and rude,\" said the 18-year-old girl from Hebei Province.\nBut she began to change her mind after she met some Japanese teenagers in a history museum six years ago. These fashionable high school students looked seriously at the history displays and talked to Mao in a friendly way. \"I found that they are not bad as I thought,\" she said.\nLike Mao, many Chinese teenagers' are caught up in this confusion. A survey by 21st Century Teens shows about 51 per cent of Chinese teenagers say they dislike Japan. But most of them still want to have a Japanese friend. Also, Japan lies third on their list of Asian countries that they want to visit, following Singapore and South Korea.\nTeens did a survey just before the 60th anniversary of the victory day of the War of Resistance against Japan, which fell on September 3. The survey aimed to encourage understanding and communication between young Chinese and Japanese.\nTeens also wanted to understand Chinese teenagers' attitudes towards Japan, and how much they actually know about the country.\nAs Teens found, more than 60 per cent of Chinese teenagers learn about Japan through the media or books. Only 16 per cent have ever met a Japanese person.\n\"Most of my friends hate Japan for what it did to China during World War II. But people should not live in hatred. I think the best way to figure it out is to have contact with the Japanese people myself,\" Zhang Yuyuan, a Senior 2 girl, told us in the survey.\n\"Japan has done wrong to Asian countries including China and it has caused pain to everyone,\" said Hikaru, a 17-year-old girl in Kawasaki  . Having visited China four times and learned much, she understands the importance of communication between the two peoples. She plans to join in an exchange programme with Chinese youth. \"Welcome to Japan, my Chinese friends!\" She says it with a smile.",
