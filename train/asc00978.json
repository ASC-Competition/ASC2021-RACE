  "article": "According to a survey,more Europeans go digitalchanging from fixed lines to mobile phones and from narrowband to broadband Internet connections.\nThe survey showed that 22 percent of EU households use only mobile phones, up from I8 percent a year ago,while the percentage of households with at least one fixed line decreased by 5 percent to 72 percent, although the percentage of households with at least one mobile phone remains fairly stable at 8l per cent.\nBroadband is presenting a rapid upward trend in the EU, showed the survey, which polled(...)27,000 households across the union. 'Itventy-eight percent of households are now connected to the Internet via high-speed \"broadband\" links, up six percent from last year, while narrowband usage has dipped by three percentage points to 12 percent. More than half of households access the Internet via an ADSL line and 34 percent of broadband connections are wireless.\n\"Europe's digital economy is growing strongly as more and more households love to choose between fixed, mobile and Internet services,\" said EU Information Society and Media Commissioner wiane Reding. \"The challenge of this year's reform of the EU's telecom rules will be to respond to this rapidly changing technological environment while enhancing at the same time effective competition:'\nMeanwhile, nearly 20 percent of Europeans buy two or more telecom products from a single service provider, the combination of fixed telephony and.Internet access being the most common. The result may strengthen the commission's case for breaking up telecom giants, whose control over the fixed line networks~accused of hindering competition.\"Today's survey findings will feed into the ongoing public debate on the reform of the EU telecom rules, planned for summer this year,\" said Reding.",
