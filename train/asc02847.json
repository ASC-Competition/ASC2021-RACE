  "article": "The truth was written all over her face. The eyes are the window to the soul. From those sayings, you would think that we could read faces. In fact, people tend to overestimate their ability to do it.\nMost of us can't distinguish between certain expressions without contextual clues. In one study, participants were unable to tell whether faces in photos were showing pain or pleasure about a quarter of the time. In another, when people watched silent videos of the same person experiencing pain and faking pain, they couldn't tell which was which.\nAnd yet, as bad as we are at reading expressions, we jump to all kinds of conclusions based on people's faces. We might scoff at the ancient physiognomy--assessing character on the basis of facial feature--but we unknowingly practice it daily. Recent research shows that while there's practically no evidence that faces reveal character, we nonetheless behave as if certain features signal certain traits. People with typically \"female\" facial features seem more trustworthy; those with lower eyebrows appear more controlling. In another study, people were ready to decide whether an unfamiliar face should be trusted after looking at it for just 200 milliseconds. Even when given a chance to look longer, they rarely changed their mind.\nSuch judgments can defy logic. Subjects playing a trust game invested more money with a player who had a trustworthy face than with one who didn't--even when the two players had the same fame. Another study reported that judges needed less evidence to sentence a person with an untrustworthy face. And a researcher focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict found that a Palestinian peace offering was more likely to be accepted by Jewish Israeli if it was attributed to a politician with \"babyfacedness\".\nWhich brings us to a contradiction. A person's face may not reflect her nature, and yet research finds that specific facial features do seem to influence futures. U.S. Army War College graduates with controlling-looking faces are more likely than their peers to become generals; people with obvious cheekbones, appearing strong and  competent, are more likely to become CEOs of successful companies. This makes a certain sense. If everyone assumes strong-chinned Daniel is an ambitious person, he's more likely to become one. Perhaps by treating others as though their face reveals their character, we motivate them to become the people we assume them to be.",
