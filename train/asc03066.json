  "article": "Research on the human brain has been attracting the attention of more and more scientists in recent years. One of the latest research topics is how to change the human brain or combine the computer and the human brain, i.e., to transplant   a chip into human brain. This innovation   may make everyone's dream come true. If we compare a human brain to a hard disc, what the scientists do is to enlarge the capacity   of the hard disc. There are some difficulties in such transplant experiments, but scientists never give up.\nExperiments were started on animals. In 1996, a transplant experiment performed at the Defense and Military Physiology Research Institute in the U.S. turned a bear into a dolphin.\nThe dolphin was named Ted, and the bear was named Tallin. Using the most advanced technology, deep and detailed studies were made of the swimming action memory area in Ted's brain by the scientists. They got a lot of useful information. The information was saved into a button-sized chip, which was then transplanted into the action memory area in Tallin's brain. The information saved on the chip was released by means of electric power.\nRecently, another memory transplant was performed at the Motor Nerve Research Institute of the University of California. The transplant was performed from a dog named \"Genius\" to a dog named \"Idiot\". \"Genius\" could understand and follow up to 100 gestures and orders made by its master. It was a real genius. \"Idiot\" was the younger brother of \"Genius\". It had no contact with people at all since its birth. It became an animal with nothing in its brain, without any memory.\n _ When the two dogs woke up, \"Idiot\" had all the abilities \"Genius\" possessed. It could follow every gesture and order given by its master. But \"Genius\" gave no response to its master, and in fact did not recognize him at all.",
