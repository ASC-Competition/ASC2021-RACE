  "article": "The Rockford police chief and some city officials want to install video cameras in all 100 police cars. They think this will reduce the number of lawsuits  against the city. In the last five years, Rockford has paid out more than five million dollars to settle about 40 lawsuits.\nThe chief said, \"If cameras had been in those cars, we wouldn't have had to pay one penny. We're always pulling over drunks or drug users who try to fight the policemen or shoot them. Then they always say that the police started beating them first or started shooting at them first. What nonsense!\"\nThe cost of installing cameras will be about $500 per car. The city council  will vote on the plan next Monday. Ten of the 13 council members, when asked about the plan, said that they liked the idea. One member said that it made good financial sense and common sense. If the cameras are supported, they can be installed in all the cars within six weeks.\nThe police officers gladly support camera use. One officer said that too many people thought the police were _ ; cameras would show citizens that the police told the truth.\nCitizen reaction to the idea of police car cameras is mixed. One person said that the police should have started doing this years ago when video cameras were invented. But an elderly man said that cameras were against privacy. \"These police are trying to stick their nose into everything,\" he said. He was going to attend the council meeting to fight the plan. He hoped that other citizens would join him.",
