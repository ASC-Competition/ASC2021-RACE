  "article": "Have you ever posted letters to your friends or parents? If so, you must have put stamps on the letters before you sent them. But, how did people receive letters before stamps were invented, and who came up with the idea of using stamps?\nIn the past, stamps and envelopes were not used. When people wanted to send a letter, they would close the paper with a seal . The person who got the letter had to pay for it. Because costs at that time were very high, most people refused to accept letters. In fact, the sender would often place secret marks on the outside of the letter. The person who was sent the letter would read the secret message. Then, they would refuse to accept the letter and did not have to pay for it.\nIn Britain, Sir Rowland Hill introduced the \"Post Office Reforms\" in 1837. He decided that letters could go to any place in the country for a penny even if the letter had to go far away. The cost was to be paid by the sender of the letter. Payment was recorded by placing a small piece of coloured paper on the letter, the stamp! On May 6,1840, the first stamp called the \"Penny Black\" was born. Because the stamp was printed in black, the stamp became known as the \"Penny Black\". This is now the world's most famous stamp. This new system spread fast.",
