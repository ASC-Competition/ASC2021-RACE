  "article": "People usually think it is very easy to cook instant noodles . They usually put the noodles into the boiling water and add in the MSG, together with the other things like eggs or vegetables. However, have you ever wondered if this is the correct way of cooking them?\nDo you know what is on the surface of the noodles? People use something like wax to cover the noodles when they make them, so that the noodles can join together nicely before they are put into the _ . Many people enjoy eating them without thinking of this. But a report said the wax covered on the noodles was very bad for our bodies. They said it needed about 2-3days to clear away the wax in our bodies after we ate it. So it is dangerous to have too much wax stayed in our stomachs. But it is not difficult to wash away the wax. Before you cook the noodles, wash them with hot water and then pour away the water. Do it like this twice, and you can wash the wax away. Then and you can cook the noodles as usual.",
