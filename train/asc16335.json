  "article": "Plans to expand wind energy into the most scenic parts of Germany are meeting increasing opposition across the country.\nAnti-wind campaigners are angry that areas including the forests made famous by the tales of the Brothers Grimm are among the targets for new turbines  . For the first time they have formed a national opposition group to _ the expansion. They say the expansion will damage forests and tourism across the country.\nGermany has started a massive expansion of renewable energy since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 in Japan. The government decided to reduce atomic plants and instead increase the opportunities for green power. As a result, solar farms, biogas plants and wind parks are booming. In 2013, 22% of Germany's electricity was generated by renewable energy. Wind has played a major part in this change, making up half of the renewable energy in 2013, and the public has been generally supportive. To date, a majority of the 23,000 wind turbines in the country have been built in the flat northern and eastern parts of the country. But now the focus of expansion is on the areas of dark forest in the central and southern areas of Germany.\nOne such region is the Rheinhardswald in the northern part of the state of Hesse. This is the home of the magical tales of Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel and others, made famous in the books of the Brothers Grimm. This scenic place is a magnet, attracting hundreds and thousands of tourists from all over the world. But now there are also plans to build up to 200 turbines in this scenic place!\nAnn-Kathrin Blankenberg is a PhD student and an opponent of the plans. \"It is not because this is the area of Sleeping Beauty,\" she says, \"I want the green movement, I want green technology, I don't want nuclear power--- but they should be made in the right way and not by destroying the forests.\"\nThe campaigners argue that putting wind turbines in this area makes no sense. The wind speeds are low and the area is home to some extremely rare birds including the endangered black stork. Campaigners say building turbines here would be disastrous for the birds.",
