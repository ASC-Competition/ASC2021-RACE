  "article": "Can you be too beautiful? It is hardly a problem that most of us have to bother -- as much as we might like to dream that it were the case.\nYet the blessings and curses of beauty have been a long-standing interest in psychology. Do those blessed with shiny faces and an attractive body live in a cloud of appreciation -- or does it sometimes pay to be ordinary?\nCombing through decades of findings, social psychologists Lisa Slattery Walker and Tonya Frevert at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte havereviewed all the evidence to dateand their conclusions are not what you might expect.\nAt the most basic level, beauty might be thought to carry a kind of halo  around it; we see that someone has one good quality, and by association, our deep mind may assume that they have other good ones too.\nEven in the courts, a pleasing appearance can work its magic. Attractive criminals are likely to get less strict sentences, or to escape punishment entirely; attractive plaintiffs , meanwhile, are more likely to win their case and get bigger financial settlements. \"It's an effect seen everywhere,\" says Walker.\nBut if beauty pays in most circumstances, there are still situations where it can have opposite results. While attractive men may be considered better leaders, for instance, hidden sexist prejudices  can work against attractive women, making them less likely to be hired for high-level jobs that require power. And as you might expect, good-looking people of both sexes run into envy -- one study found that if you are interviewed by someone of the same sex, they may be less likely to employ you if they judge that you are more attractive than they are.\nMore worryingly, being beautiful or handsome could harm your medical care. We tend to link good looks to health, meaning that illnesses are often taken less seriously when they affect the good-looking. When treating people for pain, for instance, doctors tend to take less care over the more attractive people.\nAnd the bubble of beauty can be a somewhat lonely place. One study in 1975, for instance, found that people tend to move further away from a beautiful woman on the pathway -- perhaps as a mark of respect, but still making interaction more distant. \"Attractiveness can convey more power over visible space -- but that in turn can make others feel they can't approach that person,\" says Frevert. Interestingly, the online dating website OKCupid recently reported that people with the most beautiful pictures are less likely to find dates than those with less perfect pictures.\nUltimately, Frevert points out that focusing too much on your appearance can itself be harmful if it creates stress and anxiety -- even for those already blessed with good looks. \"If you are crazy about attractiveness, it may affect your experience and interactions,\" she says. It's an outdated saying, but no amount of beauty can make up for a bad personality. As the writer Dorothy Parker put it so elegantly: \" _ .\"",
