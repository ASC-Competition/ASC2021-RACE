  "article": "Many a young person tells me he wants to be a writer. I always encourage such people,but I also explain that there's a big difference between \"being a writer\" and writing.In most cases these people are dreaming of wealth and fame, not the long hours alone at a typewriter. \"You've got to want to write, \"I say to them, \"not want to be a writer\".\nThe reality is that writing is a lonely, private and poor-paying affair. For every writer kissed by fortune there are thousands more whose longing is never rewarded. When I left a 20-year career in the U.S. Coat Guard to become a freelance writer, I had no hope at all.What I did have was a friend who found me a room in a New York apartment building.It didn't even matter that it was cold and had no bathroom.I immediately bought a used typewriter and felt like a real writer.\nAfter a year or so.However, I still hadn't gotten a break and began to doubt myself.It was so hard to sell a story that I hardly made enough to eat.But I knew I wanted to write,l had dreamed about it for years.I wasn't going to be one _ I would keep putting my dream to the test--even though it meant living with uncertainty and fear of failure.This is the _ of hope,and anyone with a dream must learn to live there.",
