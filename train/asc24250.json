A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.\n\"How much is an ice cream sundae?\"\n\"Fifty cents,\" said the waitress.\nThe little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied a number of coins in it. \"How much is a dish of plain ice cream?\" he asked.\nSome people were waiting for a table, and the waitress was not patient. \"Thirty-five cents,\" she said angrily.\nThe little boy again counted the coins. \"I will have the plain ice cream,\" he said. The waitress brought the ice cream and walked away. The boy finished, paid the money, and left.\nWhen the waitress came back, she was surprised at what she saw. There were fifteen cents placed beside the empty dish. That was her tip.",
