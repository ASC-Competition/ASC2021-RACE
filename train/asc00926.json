  "article": "As dangerous as sharks may have seed to people after watching Jaws, which was released on June 20,1975, the recent disastrous decrease in their numbers show that people have proven far more dangerous to sharks.\nThis disastrous decline is due in large part to commercial fishing of sharks. \"The market for\nshark fins in East Asia opened up thanks to changes in their economy, increasing their\nability to spend money on things such as shark fin soup,\" Burgess said.\nHowever, the biggest worry for sharks and their relatives, the skates and rays, which are suffering a similar fate, \"is how they are killed incidentally when fishermen try and take other fish--the problem of bycatch ,\" Burgess explained. \"They may be thrown back afterward, but they're still dead.\"\nThe key of the problems behind bringing sharks back is that \"they're not the same as other fish,\" Burgess said, \"Sharks are slow growing and slow to reach maturity. Sharks are live bearers, which means females keep their young in their body just like us, but instead of nine months, it takes 12 to 18 months or more in sharks. Also, sharks generally can't give birth again until a year after they've given birth--sometimes they're on a three-year cycle. So once you get a shark population knocked down, this 'life in the slow lane' means that recovery is measured in decades rather than years.\"\\\nBurgess said, \"I'm on the recovery team for it, but the recovery plan for that is over the course of 100 years. So I won't see them recover, nor will you, nor will your children. That's what it means when these animals go down--they're down a long time.\"\nAny measures aimed at saving sharks must not only consider byeatch, \"which is the real killer right now,\" but also encourage interactional cooperation, Burgess said.\n\"Sharks are very migratory, and many species cross borders,\" he said. \"We can protect them only by getting many govemment to come aboard. That's the hardest part about this.\"",
