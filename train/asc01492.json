  "article": "Now I'm a senior high school student in Grade Two . I feel that school life is a little hard , just as my friends said . However , a hard life doesn't have to mean a boring one at all .\nSchool life is not just about studying and getting high marks . Getting involved in student clubs can be a unique and unforgettable experience .\nWang Tian enjoys Tuesday afternoons more than any other time of the week . Why ? Well , that's when Wang and 47 other members of the DIY ( do it yourself ) club learn to make things such as rondo flowers (  ) and cross-stitch(  ). Wang also knows how to knit scarves and make clay accessories(  ). They even sell their products to raise money for poor students !\nWhen Chen Mo started the High School , there was a drama club and a rock band , but no street dance club . So the girl started one . \"Street dancing is dynamic and helps us relax and keep fit ,\" Chen said . There are around 30 students in Chen's club . They practice dance skills on Sundays . Sometimes they go to street dance performances in the city . \"We watch , learn and make friends . People in this circle are actually very nice and sweet ,\" she said .\nThere are dozens of clubs for me to choose from , such as basketball club or science club . But I love the translation club best . The 30 club members get together once a week . With the help of a volunteer teacher , I've learned the general principles of professional translation . It's the first step to becoming a good translator . Besides ,after attending this club , my English has improved a lot .\nI like my school life very much . And I believe whether a life is meaningful or not depends on the person who leads it .",
