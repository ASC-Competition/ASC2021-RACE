  "article": "More and more people are aware that an afternoon nap  can do a body good. But there are still doubters out there. To help spread the power of the afternoon nap, we list some common misunderstandings about napping we still hear.\nMisunderstanding # 1 : Napping is only for the lazy.\nFact: Around a third of American adults nap on the average day, and for good reason: A short nap can improve everything from alertness  and memory to creativity and productivity . And none of these sounds like laziness to us!\nMisunderstanding # 2 : If I take a nap, I'll only wake up feeling worse.\nFact: That weak feeling after you wake up from a nap is real (it even has a name: sleep inertia), but it's not a guarantee . How you feel after your nap is a factor of how long you sleep. Experts generally agree that a nap should last no longer than 30 minutes. \"If it takes longer than 30 minutes, you end up in deep sleep. You're going into a stage of sleep where you find it very difficult to wake up.\" said sleep expert Michael J. Breus, Ph. D. Next time you're in the mood for a nap, set your alarm for 20 to 30 minutes, tops.\nMisunderstanding # 3 : You mustn't nap at work.\nFact: In fact, in the office environment, we're all for catching a few winks   during the workday. Some companies have even created special rooms for afternoon naps as more and more employers come around to the idea that a well-rested workforce is a more productive workforce. If your employer doesn't offer a place to lay your head, try to find an empty conference room where you can close the door and turn off the lights. Really want. You can also take a nap during your lunch break on a park bench or in your car.\nMisunderstanding # 4 : I'll be more productive if I just finish this task, rather than waste time sleeping.\nFact: Yes, you'll be away from your desk if you spend 10 to 30 minutes sleeping. But you'll likely make up for that \"wasted\" time afterward. \"My research shows that people feel tired after a long time of work during the day,\" Sara Mednick told Bloomberg Businessweek. \"It's difficult to keep energetic and productive all day.\" However, a nap can leave you feeling refreshed and more ready to deal with the task at hand.",
