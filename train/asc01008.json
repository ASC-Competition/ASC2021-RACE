  "article": "Five Things You Should Know About Adult Asthma  \nAbout 44 million people in Asia Pacific suffer from asthma. The numbers are on the rise especially in China and India where there is rapid industrialization and urbanization. Dr Mariko Koh, Director of the Pulmonary Function Laboratory and Asthma Programme at Singapore General Hospital, tells us more about adult asthma:\n1. Chronic inflammation   of the airways\nWhen the airways are inflamed, mucus   forms, blocking airflow, causing breathlessness, wheezing   and tightness in the chest.\n2. Common triggers\nExposure to allergens   such as mites, cockroaches, pets and pollen can trigger asthma. Tobacco smoke, respiratory infections, exercise and some medications like aspirin and beta blockers are also possible triggers.\n3. Effective treatment\nAsthma can be controlled with medication. The main treatment of asthma is inhaled   corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and block of the airways. Reliever medications may be used to treat acute symptoms. Take note: it is not too late to take medication after an asthma attack.\n4. Take medication daily\nTo ensure good control over asthma, medication must be taken daily on a long term basis to prevent attacks. Also, go to your doctor for regular checkups.\n5. Quality of life\nAsthma sufferers can lead normal active lives as long as the symptoms are well controlled. Taking medication as directed and avoiding triggers can make a big difference to the quality of life.",
