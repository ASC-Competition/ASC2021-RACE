  "article": "Parents on South Australia's Aboriginal   lands may lose some of their financial aid if they do not send their children to school. The new rules draw wide concern.\nMundine is Prime Minister Tony Abbott's top advisor on issues concerning Aboriginals, native Australians. \"Now, I know the government needs some necessary measures but I think punishing the parents is really the last choice.\" Mr. Mundine says the situation can be changed if the tribal leaders support education. \"We need to work with parents and communities because we are making a huge cultural change here.\" But other officials say they believe the threat of stopping aid will force families to take education more seriously.\nThe State of South Australia says it has special programs for Aboriginal children. The students work with their parents and teachers first to develop a personal learning plan and the public schools provide special workers to work individually with Aboriginal students. At the age of seven, Aboriginal students can join a program called Enter for Success designed to attract students to school. The students can choose which high school to attend and receive support in reaching the goals on their individual learning plans.\nThe State of Western Australia also has special programs for Aboriginal and other ethnic   groups. The state operates a program called Focus Schools which centers on basic skills like reading, writing and counting. 67% of these public focus schools serve the students in 79 very rural areas. Most of them are primary schools. The Focus Schools program also includes 118 coaches working with students in 134 schools.",
