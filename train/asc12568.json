But when you are playing in the NBA, it is really not so easy.\" He said that joining the Houston Rockets was a new start and a new challenge. \"I hope that through very hard work I can make everyone happy and help the Rockets win more games,\" he said.Yao Ming speaks some English. Both he and his teammates can understand each other. They don't think there is a language problem.
