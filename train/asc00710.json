  "article": "Sports are all about change. A team gets better. A kid practices more and swims a personal best or learns a new move on the basketball court. In 2006, two things happened that got me thinking about change--in sports and in life.\nOne of them is tennis champion Andre Agassi, who retired in 2006. Agassi was a terrific player who won 60 titles, including eight major championships . But his greatest accomplishment might have been how much he changed during his career.\nWhen he was young, Agassi was a show off who seemed to care only about himself. He didn't train very hard, but he won matches because of his tremendous  talent.\nEventually, though, injuries and his bad attitude caught up with him. He fell from No.1 in the world ranking to No.141.\nSo Agassi changed. He trained harder and became a world-class player again. More importantly, he changed as a person. He was nicer to fans and opponents . He stopped thinking just about himself and started thinking about others. Through his Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation, he raised more than $60 million to help disadvantaged kids around his hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada. He even started a school, the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy, for at-risk kids.\nAt the start of a new year, lots of people promise themselves they will change. They might _ to get in good physical shape, do better in school or be nicer to others.\nChanges such as those can be difficult. But they do happen. Just remember Andre Agassi: It wasn't easy, but he changed, and changed for the better.",
