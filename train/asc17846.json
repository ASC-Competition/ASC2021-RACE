  "article": "On the last day before Christmas, I hurried to a store to buy some gifts. While looking in the toys section,.  I noticed a small boy of about five years old, pressing a doll against his chest.Keeping on touching the hair of the doll, the boy murmured sadly, \"I don't have enough money.What can I do?\" I walked towards him and asked him curiously who he wanted to give the doll to.\n\" It is the doll that my sister loved most and wanted so much for this Christmas.She was so sure that Santa Claus would bring it to her.\" I told him that maybe Santa Claus would bring it to her after all and not to worry.However, he replied sadly, \" No, Santa Claus cannot take it to where she is now.I have to give the doll to my mother so that she can give it to her when she goes there.\" His eyes looked so sad while saying this. \" My sister has gone to be with God.Daddy says that Mommy will also join God very soon so I think that she can take the doll with her to give it to my sister.\" My heart nearly stopped.\nThe boy looked up at me and said, \" I told Daddy to tell Mommy not to go yet.I asked him to wait until I come back from the store.\" Then, he showed me a very nice photo of him where he was laughing.He told me, \" I also want Mommy to take this photo with her so that she will not forget me, I love my Mommy and I wish she didn't have to leave me but Daddy says that she has to go and join my little sister.\" Then he looked at the doll again quietly with sad eyes.\nI quickly reached my hand into my pocket, saying, \"What if we checked again, just in case, to see if you have enough money?\"",
