  "article": "If there is an \"Olympics for Eating\", the days from Halloween in October to Super Bowl Sunday in January are it. Kids always get at least 7 pounds heavier over these holidays.\nWell, what do we have in the \"Olympic for eating\"? The first activity is the Halloween Candy. You can try any way to collect candies.\nNext is the Thanksgiving food. You have dinner around a turkey with family and friends on Thanksgiving Day. Eat the delicious food as much as you can. About one month later there is Christmas and then the New Year's celebration. Go on eating delicious porridge  and peas. You are so lucky to have so many holidays and get so close to each other. At last, the game ends with Super Bowl Sunday. On this day, you don't have dinner. You have mountains of snacks!\nWho wins the game? Those who don't get heavier! Start practising now! You must be more careful about what you can eat!",
