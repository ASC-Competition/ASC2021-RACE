  "article": "You've probably heard of working dogs that help police officers, or horses that help farmers. Did you know that carrier pigeons can be trained to help people too? Here are some examples.\nMailman\nCarrier pigeons can be trained to carry messages to people. The note is placed into a small can. The can is tied to the pigeon's leg. Then the pigeon flies off with the note.\nLifeguard\nFrom high up in the sky, specially trained pigeons can find orange life jackets in the ocean. Sometimes it is difficult for humans to find people lost at sea, especially when the weather is bad. However, pigeons can fly quickly over a large area of water to look for people.\nSpy\nMany years ago, carrier pigeons were used to help our country during wars  . \"Spy pigeons\" had small cameras that were tied to their feet. As a pigeon flew over enemy  land, the camera took photos of the land below. This would allow our soldiers to see where the enemies were and what they were doing.\nSo next time you see a pigeon, stop and watch it closely. What might look like an ordinary bird to most people, might actually be helpful.",
