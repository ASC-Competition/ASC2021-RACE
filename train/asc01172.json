  "article": "During the week days,  they are luckily busy office people; but on weekends, they are just a brood of stay-home animals. A recent survey shows that office workers in China prefer quiet and easy ways to spend their weekends.\nIn the survey, conducted by job seeking and offering website Zhaopin.com, 32.8 percent of the 6,000 respondents choose to stay home at weekends and have a good rest, the Beijing Morning Post reported.\nTwenty percent use their days-off to do housework. And only 19.3 percent are willing to have fun during the break time from work. Their first choice of fun is shopping.\nOther choices, though practiced by few, include meeting friends, accompanying the children, trips to the suburbs, and lessons for more skills.\nWhen they. go shopping, 54.5 percent of the white-collars actually shop in supermarkets, while 27.9. percent attend other stores, especially when discounts are offered.\nThese activities don't seem to cost much, as 60 percent spend average less than 200 yuan (US$26) during weekends, and 30 percent no more than 500 yuan.\nWhen asked whom they would spend the weekends with, about 40 percent mention their partners, and 30 percent prefer a weekend all by themselves. Less than 20 percent hang out with friends.\nOnly 5.8 percent would kill the time with their colleagues. This is because we tend to avoid too many personal contacts with our co-workers when we don't have to work with them, according to some experts.",
