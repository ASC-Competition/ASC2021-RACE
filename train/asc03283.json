  "article": "I don't think a day goes by when I don't think of my father. He died twenty-one years ago when I was twenty-six. He was a good man , but I hardly saw him around home, for he ran a big company. I secretly wished something could bring him closer to me.\nIt wasn't until he became seriously ill that we really got to know each other and had a place in each other's lives. After his near death and many operations, I was trained as his nurse to take care of him. Although the job seemed boring and tiring in certain people's eyes, I liked it. Taking care of him seemed to reduce the pain of his absence from my younger life. I enjoyed his company and attention and, though through a sad situation, I was finally getting my fill .\nNow I am a dad myself, but certainly not a _ as my father. Although I work away from my home, I always have my meals with my family. Father's Day is coming I still have the pencil holder made from a decorated tin sitting on my desk. It's a gift from my only son. Each year, the gift is something different and each year, I couldn't care less about the gift itself. You see, the gift I enjoy is the pleasure of my son's company and knowing that we have a place in each other's lives.\nAt heart , all men know their fathers are important. Want a great Father's Day? Tell your dad you love him and give your kid a hug today-before Father's Day actually arrives.",
