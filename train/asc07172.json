  "article": "Jules Verne was a Frenchman who was born in 1828 and died in 1905. He read a great many scientific books and wrote a number of exciting books about the things which he thought that scientists and inventors would one day be able to do. Years later, many of the things really happened. At that time, however, his stories seemed like fairy tales.\n       Jules Verne's most famous book is 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.(A league is an old word meaning a distance of about three miles). In those days submarines had not been invented but he described an underwater ship very like a modern one. \n       Many of the things Jules wrote about in his books more than a hundred years ago to look into the future, however, were surprisingly exact. In his book From the Earth to the Moon he wrote at the age of about forty, three men and a dog made a journey around the moon in a hollow ship fired from a gun. After going around the moon, they returned to the earth and splashed down into the sea not far from where the first real moon traveler landed in July, 1969.",
