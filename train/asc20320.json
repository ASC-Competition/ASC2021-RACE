She looked very kind. She was sitting there, watching pigeons . Little Mike went up and sat next to her. He took out his food and drinks and gave some to her. She smiled at him. Her smile was very sweet and Mike wanted to see it again. She seemed to understand him, so once again she smiled. Mike was very happy.\nThey sat there all the afternoon, eating and talking. As it was dark, Mike got up to leave. Before he left, he hugged the old lady and she gave him her sweetest smile.\nWhen Mike got home, his mother was surprised by the happy look on his face. \" I met an old lady in the park. Her smile was like the smile I used to see on Grandmother's face.\"\nThe old lady also returned to her home happily.
