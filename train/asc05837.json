  "article": "Some British and American people like to invite friends for a meal at home.  You should not be upset if your English friends don't invite you home.  It doesn't mean they don't like you!\nDinner parties usually start between 7 p. m.  and 8 p. m.  and end at about 11 p. m.  Ask your host what time you should arrive.  It's polite to bring flowers, chocolates or a bottle of wine as a gift. \nUsually the evening starts with drinks and snacks.  Do you want to be extrapolite? Say how much you like the room, or the pictures on the wall.  But remember--it's not polite to ask how much things cost. \nIn many families, the husband sits at one end of the table and the wife sits at the other side.  They eat with their guests. \nYou'll probably start the meal with soup or something small, then you'll have meat or fish with vegetables, and then dessert, followed by coffee.  It's polite to finish everything on your plate and to take more if you want it. \nDid you enjoy the evening? Call your hosts the next day, or write them a short\"Thank you\"letter.  British and American people like to say\"Thank you, thank you, thank you\"all the time!",
