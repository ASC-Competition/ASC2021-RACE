  "article": "In the year 1986 there was a terrible explosion . The explosion was at a nuclear power plant  in Ukraine. The radiation  caused a lot of damage. It polluted the soil and other things. People were living in the area when the explosion happened. More than twenty years later those people are still suffering. The _ of the explosion will go on for a long time.\nOver two million people still live in that area. Only 56 people died from the explosion but many other problems have been caused because of it. Some types of cancer are more than 200 times above the world average . Many children have cancer now and children born with problems have doubled since the accident.\nSome people in the United States are worried about the children living in the explosion area. One group has been trying to raise money. They are called the Chenobyl Children's Project. They want to bring children from Ukraine to the U.S. each summer.\nA spokesperson for the group says that radiation is the highest in the summertime so it is a good time to get the children out of the country. They want to help the children get away for a little while. The Project wants them to be safe from radiation.\nIt costs $1,500 to bring each child to the United States for six weeks. The group raised enough money to bring 28 children to the United States last year. The children were able to do lots of fun things. They enjoyed clean air, healthy food, and plenty of outdoor fun. One little nine-year-old girl who got to come to the United States said that she likes America.\nThe spokesperson says that the children that come to America during the summer miss less school when they return home because they have a long summer vacation.",
