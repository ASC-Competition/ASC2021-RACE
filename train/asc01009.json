  "article": "Is there clear boundary between science and the liberal arts as a major for college students?  The question of whether our government should promote science and technology or the liberal arts in higher education is not an either / or proposition  , although the current emphasis on preparing young Americans for STEM (science, technology, engineering, maths) -related fields can make it seem that way.\nThe latest congressional report acknowledges the critical importance of technical training, but also stresses that the study of the humanities   and social sciences must remain central elements of America's educational system at all levels. Both are critical to producing citizens who can participate effectively in our democratic society, become innovative   leaders, and benefit from the spiritual enrichment that the reflection on the  great ideas of mankind over time provides.\nParents and students who have invested heavily in higher education worry about graduates' job prospects   as technological advances and changes in domestic and global markets transform professions in ways that reduce wages and cut jobs. Under this circumstances, it's natural to look for what may appear to be the most \"practical\" way out of the problem. \"Major in a subject designed to get you a job\" seems the obvious answer to some, though this ignores the fact that many disciplines in the humanities characterized as \"soft\" often, in fact, lead to employment and success in the long run. Indeed, according to surveys, employers have expressed a preference for students who have received a broadly-based education that has taught them to write well, think critically, research creatively, and communicate easily.\nMoreover, students should be prepared not just for their first job, but for their 4th and 5th jobs, as there is little reason to doubt that people entering the workforce today will be called upon to play many different roles over the course of their careers. The ones who will do the best in this new environment will be those whose educations have prepared them to be flexible. The ability to draw upon every available tool and insight - picked up from science, arts, and technology - to solve the problems of the future, and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves, will be helpful to them and the  United States.",
