  "article": "By November 30, 2015, the comedy Goodbye, Mr. Loser had got more than 1,400 million yuan in ticket sales.\nIt was amazing that a film with common actors who had their first shows in the film got such great success. What's more, the actors were all stage performers and they improved their acting skills by making this film.\nThe comedy tells about a common middle-aged man who has no job but problems. He seems to be a loser in life and never gets any success. He causes many jokes and is laughed at a lot. And because of his bad luck, he feels upset most of the time. Later, a sudden accident changes his life and he starts to realize how important the family to him.\nGoodbye, Mr. Loser was the first movie made by Happy Mahua Pictures. The film came out on September 30, 2015. Because of its great success, the film company became famous overnight.\nDuring the seven-day holiday for National Day in 2015, the ticket sales were just behind the most popular film being shown at the same time-Lost in Hong Kong.",
