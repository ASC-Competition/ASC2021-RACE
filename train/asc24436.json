  "article": "Is your schoolbag too heavy to carry? The e-schoolbag will help you.\nIt is said that e-schoolbags are going to be brought into use in Chinese middle schools soon. In fact, the e-schoolbag should perhaps be called an e-textbook. It is a small computer for students. Heavy schoolbags are a problem for them. But the e-schoolbag will change everything. It is much lighter than a usual schoolbag. Also it is as small as a usual book, but it can still hold all the things for study, such as a textbook, an exercise book and so on. They can be made into chips   that are as small as a stamp. The students can read the text page by page on the _ , take notes, or even send e-mails to their teachers. All they have to do is to put the right chip into the e-schoolbag and press a button  .\nSome say that e-textbooks can be easily broken; some say it is not good to students' eyes. But only time will tell.",
