You will hate yourself for not being consistent. For doing things you know that you don't want to do, another stress is right there.\n2. Do less\nThis is one of the hardest things, especially for me. I'm doing too many things at the same time. In itself, doing many different things to figure out what works and what doesn't isn't that had. It's actually quite good. But at some point you need to let go of the things that don't work and focus on the things that work. And that's the hardest part, at least for me. I always try to make everything work. And if you always try to make everything work, you'll usually end up with nothing working at all.\n3. Get rid of complicated things\nThere are many complicated things in life. Complicated relationships, complicated jobs, complicated whatever. What all of these things do is that they steal our focus.\nThey add an additional stress layer to our lives and take over some of our brain's bandwidth(;). We desperately need to navigate bandwidth in this crazy and complex world.\n4. Read books, not blogs\nBlogs consist of too much information for our brains to process. Blogs usually leave out the story our brains need. Our brains need a story to remember things.\nDon't believe me? Try it. What parts of this blog post do you remember? Probably none. All that blogs do is that they clutter our brains with useless information we forget immediately after we read them. A waste of time.\nThere are a number of personal traits which all of us should develop in our earlier life.",
