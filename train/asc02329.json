  "article": "I am a sophomore   at Princeton University, where I am majoring in chemical engineering. I chose to study at UCD in the spring of 2015 primarily because I have always been interested in Ireland and Irish culture, but also to take advantage of UCD's courses in pharmacology  , a field not offered at my home school. I also chose UCD because of its Introduction to Scientific Research module, which matches visiting students with professors for a term-long research project, and because of the Science office's friendliness and helpfulness. I am convinced that I made the best possible decision!\nWhile at UCD I lived on campus, which allowed me to throw myself into everything the university has to offer. I was given the opportunity to work with Geraldine Butler's lab. I loved it so much that I ended up heading to the lab almost every weekday, whenever I wasn't attending my always-interesting classes in pharmacology. After lab, I enjoyed a variety of after-school activities--that was certainly a new experience for me.\nLiving in Dublin provided a great opportunity for seeing the rest of Ireland and Europe. I spent my weekends and spring break traveling to every corner of the island, amazed at all of the history and natural beauty. I was also able to visit the UK, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden. After every trip, it was nice to return to friendly Dublin and head out with my roommates to one of our favorite pubs.\nI would highly recommend studying abroad at UCD. I learned so much from my courses and my research project and had a wonderful time exploring Ireland. I can't wait to come back!",
