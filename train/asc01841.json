  "article": "When 47yearold volunteer Susan Boyle stepped onto the stage of Britain's Got Talent and announced she was unemployed, had never been married and \"never been kissed, actually\", few in the audience would have wondered why. This Ms Boyle, looking unfashionable, from a village in Scotland, shocked the three judges and the audience with the song I dreamed a dream on a show of Britain's Got Talent.\nShe couldn't hide the awkwardness when walking to the center of the stage in a house dress, and everyone -- including the judges -- seemed laughing at her when she said she wanted to be as successful as Elaine Paige. As soon as she began singing, however, everyone in the hall fell silent, then rose within seconds to admire her wonderful voice as the celebrity judges sat openmouthed, and remained standing to the end.\nAfter her performance,  one of the judges Piers Morgan said,\"Without doubt that was the biggest surprise I've had in three years of this show. When you stood there everyone was laughing at you. No one is laughing now. That was amazing.\" Actress Amanda Holden followed,\"I'm so thrilled because I know that we everybody were against you. I honestly think that we were all being very cynical    and I think that's the biggest wakeup call ever.\"\nSusan obviously won over the hearts of millions around the world with success spreading across the Atlantic.  Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher, who has nearly 1.5 million followers, speaks highly of her. Kutcher posted a link to the video clip  . The Scottish talent made her live American show via satellite connection on CBS's The Early Show, doing an interview and singing live from her room. And she already accepted an invitation from talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey.\nNow Boyle has become one of the world's hottest celebrities. The video clip of her performance has been viewed more than 50 million times on Youtube, becoming a hit on the Internet.",
