Cages made it easy for visitors to see the animals, but a small cage is not a good place for an animal to live in.\nToday animals live in open areas. There are usually plants and a little lake around, like the animals' habitats. Visitors usually stay in the bus to see the animals outside.\nZoos help to protect all kinds of animals.
