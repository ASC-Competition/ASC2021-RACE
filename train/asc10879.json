  "article": "The car was invented just a century ago. You may know all kinds of cars' names, but many people don't know who was the inventor of the first car.\nThe first car was invented not by an Englishman, but by an American. His name was Henry Ford.\nHenry was born in a poor family, He was the eldest of the six children. When he was a boy, he became interested in watches and machines. When he was twelve years old, his mother died. Soon he had to work in a machine shop for two dollars and fifty cents a week. In the evenings, he repaired watches for another hour for another dollar a week. The hard life made him strong and able. At that time, there was another interest in the life of the young boy. He hoped to make a machine. It could run without horses. He overcame a lot of difficulties and in April, 1893, the \"horseless carriage\" was invented at last. It was the first car. Later, Henry Ford set up the Ford Motor Company. He was the really first inventor of car in the world.",
