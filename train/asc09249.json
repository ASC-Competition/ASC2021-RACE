  "article": "In a great many cities, hundreds of people ride bikes to work every day. In New York, some bike riders have even formed a group called Bike for a Better City. They declare that if more people rode bikes to work, there would be fewer automobiles in the downtown part of the city and so less dirty air from car engines.\nFor several years, this group had been trying to get the city government to help bike riders. For example, they want the city to draw special lanes  for bikes on some of the main streets, because when bike riders must use the same lanes as cars there are accidents. Bike for a Better City feels that if there were special lanes, more people would use bikes.\nBut no bike lanes have been drawn. Not everyone thinks it is a good idea--they say it will slow traffic. Some store owners on the main streets don't like the idea--they say that if there is less traffic, they will have less business.\nThe city government has not yet decided what to do. It wants to keep everyone happy. On weekends, Central Park--the largest place open ground in New York-- is closed to cars, and the roads may be used by bikes only.",
