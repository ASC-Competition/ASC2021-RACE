  "article": "Miss sending letters? Try Lettrs! This new service brings back the art of letter writing by marrying it to the Internet.\nLettrs, a new site, is attempting to bring back the old-fashioned idea of letter writing by providing a space that feels a little bit like a writing desk.\nOf course, there'll be purists who say that to truly enjoy letter writing you must do it on fancy letter paper and envelope in the mail is part of the fun. And if you're into that sort of thing, go for it. But I can't be the only one who is now so much faster at typing that writing by hand is painfully slow. Nor can I be the only one who likes to write on a whim   when I'm going to be on a crowded train or airplane, both of which are situations where writing on the computer is far easier.\nThe site tries, pretty seriously, to approximate  what it's like to have your very own writing desk and paper to choose from (which comes in various prints and colors) as well as corresponding types of prints and cursive writing   that come out on your screen as you write. There's also a \"desk drawer\" for letters you've already sent, a \"fridge\" to post letters publicly, a \"kitchen counter\" for letters you have just received, and \"shoebox\" to store your letters in.\nAnd if you need inspiration there are even old-style letters that are great examples of the kind of correspondence people used to send. Lettrs is such a great idea, because you get the best parts of communicating online (typing rather than writing, the speed, no lost mail, and it's free! ) with the nice parts of a letter-the sense of sitting down to write, quietly, to one person in a meaningful way.\nWho would you write to?",
