  "article": "In the very early 1800's, a young boy about 14 years old named John lived in a orphanage  in Old England along with several other children. Orphan meant unwanted and unloved.\nChristmas was the one day of the year when the children didn't work and received a gift, an orange. Usually they tried to taste and keep it for so long that it often went bad before they ever peeled it to enjoy the sweet juice. Many thoughts were expressed as Christmas time drew near. The children would say, \"I will keep mine the longest.\" John usually slept with his next to his pillow. This year John was overjoyed by the Christmas season. He was becoming a man and stronger and soon he would be old enough to leave. He would save his orange until his birthday in July.\nChristmas day finally came. The children were so excited as they entered the big dinning hall. Immediately the master shouted, \"John, leave the hall and there will be no orange for you this year.\" John's heart broke violently wide open. He turned and went quickly back to the cold room. Then he heard the door open and each of the children entered. Little Elizabeth with her hair falling over her shoulders, a smile on her face, and tears in her eyes held out a piece of rag to John. \"Here John,\" she said, \"this is for you.\" As he lifted back the edges of the rag he saw a big juicy orange all peeled and quartered  and then he realized what they had done.\nJohn never forgot the sharing, love and personal sacrifice  his friends had shown him that Christmas day. In memory of that day every year he would send oranges all over the world to children everywhere.",
