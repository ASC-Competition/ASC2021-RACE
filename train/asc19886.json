  "article": "Most children like watching TV. It's very interesting. By watching TV they can see and learn a lot and know many things about their country and the world. Of course, they can also learn over the radio. But they can learn better and more easily on TV. Why? Because they can hear and watch at the same time. But they can't see anything over the radio. TV helps to open children's eyes. It helps to open their minds   , too. They learn newer and better ways of doing things.\nMany children watch TV only on Saturday or Sunday evening. They are always busy with their classes. But a few children watch TV every night. They go to bed very late. They can't have a good rest. How about you, my young friends?",
