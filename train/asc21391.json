  "article": "Hello,everyone!\nMy name is Emily.I'm 38 years old and live in a small city near New York now.Three years ago.I started to learn Russian.I once had a Russian friend.We used to meet twice a month and have some coffee and a talk together.However, she went to China later, so nobody can help me with my Russian.I hope to find an outgoing Russian girl to help me learn more about Russian culture.I can help you with your English or Spanish.I can also speak a little Chinese.I have many friends in this city and they think I'm friendly.I think we'll be good friends and have much good time. If you like to be my friend, you can email me at emily@163.com.I'm sorry for writing in English but it would take me too long to express myself in Russian.\nHope to hear from you soon.\nEmily",
