  "article": "A board game is a game played on a pre-marked surface or \"board\" according to a set of rules. Board games have been played in most cultures and societies throughout history. Do you think of yourself as a bit of an expert at board games like chess or Go?\nMaybe you're not quite as good as you think. New research from the University of Manchester and Oxford suggests complex games like these are impossible to learn fully. They may even be too complex for the human mind to understand.\nResearchers studied two-player games, to try and understand the strategies which people use to make decisions during the game. Some games with two players are simple, with only a small number of possible moves. Players can quickly work out the best strategy but that means the game soon becomes boring.\nIt gets more interesting when there are many possible moves. That's why people are so fascinated by complex board games like chess or Go, or some card games. But what the researchers found was that with difficult games, players find it hard to work out the best strategy and their actions become less reasonable.\nThis research is part of the field called game theory: the study of human strategic decision-making. Much thinking on how people play complex games is based on something called \"the balance point\", which is when players have a perfect knowledge of what they are going to do and of what their rivals are going to do.\nWhen you add more than two players then of course the game becomes even harder to understand. Trading on the stock market is an example of a complex multi-player game.",
