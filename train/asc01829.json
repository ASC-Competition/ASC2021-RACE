  "article": "Sometimes, kindness is a simple answer in a difficult and challenging world.\nWhen my granddaughter, Skylar, was young, one day we went out and had a contest called \"Who can make the most people smile. \" And we continue it today. When shopping, we were walking in the supermarket and noticed someone walking down the aisle with her head down. Skylar walked up to her and gave her a big smile. I watched her walk down the aisle, turned around and smiled at Skylar again or perhaps smiled at someone else.\nKindness is a chain that pulls us all together. Every single act of kindness has a ripple effect . In 2002, my dad had a series of strokes and other illness. My dad had been doing nice things for all sorts of people for years, from the street crossing guard, to the waitress in a restaurant, to a friend's mother. That same day, I made cookies for the janitor  at the post office. When I gave him the cookies he actually looked a little embarrassed. \"Why, Linda?\" he asked. \"Because I appreciate you!\" I answered. \"When I get here at 6 am and it is still dark out and it is a little scary, I know you are inside and I feel safe. And when I first moved here and my post office box was always empty, you always cheered me on. And you always keep this place clean.\"\nThat evening his wife called me and said that he was overwhelmed . \"No one even knows his name, let alone bakes him cookies!\" she said. (278 words)",
