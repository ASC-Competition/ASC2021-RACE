  "article": "Zambia is a country in southern Africa. More than half of the population is very poor, and companies pay people very little money for their work. One woman named Sylvia Banda had a dream to become a successful businesswoman and build her own brand  . So, after finishing high school, Banda went to college to learn how to start a food company. She studied hard and spent her free time coming up with ways to make money, including making food and selling it to friends.\nIn 1987, when Banda was 24 years old, she decided to start her own restaurant. She borrowed a room and used food, and pans from her own kitchen. The first day, her restaurant did not have any chairs or tables, but she was able to sell all of the food that she had made. After counting the money, she was surprised that she had made more in one day than most people make in one month.\nFrom that small restaurant, Banda built a large company called the Sylva Group. It now has hundreds of people working for it and is worth over a million dollars. Besides restaurants, the company has now built hotels and a college in Zambia, and it also sells many kinds of packaged   foods. After reaching her goal   of starting her own business and becoming rich, Banda decided to work to improve the lives of other Zambians.\nShe does this in a number of ways. For one, her restaurants use vegetables and other products   made in Zambia, and by doing so, Banda can support the farmers. Her college also teaches farmers ways to make their farms better, which helps them make more money. The college also helps young Zambians get skills to start their own businesses. Through hard work, Banda has been able to improve both her life and her country.",
