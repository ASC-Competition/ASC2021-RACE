  "article": "David Cameron mistakenly left his eight-year-old daughter in a pub by herself when he drove off without her, as was reported last night.\nThe Prime Minister --who had been enjoying Sunday drinks with his family near Chequers--only realized his eldest daughter was missing when he arrived back at his official country house.\nThe Camerons had been drinking at the Plough Inn, in Cadsden, Buckinghamshire, with their three children and two other families. As they were to leave, Nancy went off to the toilet without telling them.\nThe Prime Minister was driven back to Chequers, which is two miles from the pub, with protection officers in one car. Mr Cameron thought that Nancy was in the car with his wife, while she thought that their daughter had jumped in with the Prime Minister.\nA spokesman for the Prime Minister last night said he was worried when he realized what had happened. They later confirmed that Mr Cameron returned to the pub to pick up Nancy.\n\"Thankfully when they phoned the pub she was there safe and well,\" the spokesman said. \"The Prime Minister went down straight away to get her.\"\nWhen Mr Cameron arrived back at the pub, he found his daughter happily helping the owner of the pub. It is understood she had been left by herself for 15 minutes.\nThe spokesman refused to discuss whether Mr Cameron had drunk alcohol. \"He had gone with friends at lunchtime, with a number of families with children, and they left in various different vehicles. As you know, the Prime Minister is a very busy man but he always tries to live as normal a life as possible with his family.\" he said.\nLast night a pub \"insider\" said: \"You'd have thought that someone would have done a headcount or something.\"\nIt's not like you can look up David Cameron in the phonebook and then ring to say you've left your daughter behind. It's frightening that the Prime Minister of Britain can forget something so important as his own daughter.",
