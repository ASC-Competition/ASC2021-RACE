  "article": "Most children now chat daily either online or through their mobile phones. They are connecting to a huge number of other children all over the world. Some are shy \"in real life\" but are confident to communicate with others online; others find support from people of their own age on relationship issues, or problems at home.\nSometimes the online world, just like the real word, can introduce problems, such as bullying or arguments. Going online is great fun, but there are also a few people who use the Internet for offensive or illegal aims. Children must be made _ of both the good things and the danger.\nTo keep children safe your management must cover the family computer. Just as you decide which TV programs are suitable, you need to do the same for the websites and chat rooms your children visit. Remind your children that online friends are still strangers. Reminding them of the risks will keep them alert.  \nComputer studies are part of schoolwork now, so it's likely that your children may know more than you do. We get left behind when it comes to the latest gadgets   and interactive areas of websites, like chat rooms and message boards, which are especially strange. The language of chat is strange to many parents, too. Chatters love to use abbreviations such as: atb-- all the best; bbfn-- bye by for now; cul8er --see you later; gr8--great; idk-- I don't know; imbl-- it must be love; kit --keep in touch; paw-- parents are watching; lol--laugh out loud; xlnt-- excellent!",
