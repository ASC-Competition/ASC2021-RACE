  "article": "From poor beginnings to most expensive player\nZINEDINE Zidane,who dreams of leading France to its second World Cup title in a row next month,has always preferred to express himself with a football rather than with words.\nLast Wednesday Zidane scored the decisive goal when Real Madrid of Spain won the Champions League final against Germany's Leverkusen 21.\nHe became one of the world's most expensive players when he joined Real Madrid from Italy's Juventus for US $ 66 million.And he has been a national hero since he scored twice in the 3-O defeat of Brazil in the 1998 World Cup Final.\nBut despite his success,Zidane has always kept his feet on the ground.He leads a quite family life,there is hardly any gossip about him and he avoids putting his wife and two children in the spotlight.\n\"Just because I'm a public figure it doesn't mean I have to express myself on everything.I don't like to discuss some personal matters publicly.\"he said.\nEven as a child playing football in the slum area of Marseille,France,where he was raised by his Algerian parents,Zidane was shy.\nHe loved football even as a little kid.\"I realized football is a wonderful mixture of a sharp mind and hard training rather than just talking,\"he said.\nEven when the match awards were just chocolate and bread,Zidane found that football made his poor childhood rich.\nBefore he was 10 years old,it was obvious that he could become a great footballer.He was offered his first professional contract when he was just 20.Now,at the age of 29,he has already picked up two World Player  of the year awards.\nThis quiet striker has not yet spoken of his hopes for the coming World Cup.But his fans across the world will be eagerly watching him to see what he'll do this time.",
