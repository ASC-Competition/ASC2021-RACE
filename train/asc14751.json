  "article": "Bedazzling   with their bright colors and eye-catching displays, fireworks light up our night skies during the holidays. However, these crowd-pleasers can have some damaging side effects.\nOnce a firework is set off, it only takes a couple of seconds before smoke, dust and harmful chemicals are let out into the atmosphere. The loud booming noises are caused by gunpowder. While the sounds may excite some people, they can be frightening to domestic and wild animals--as well as some humans.\nThe pretty colors you see are a result of more chemicals. Barium, added to make green, is known for its poisonous and radioactive qualities. Blue comes from copper compounds. Cadmium, lithium and lead--all found in fireworks--have been linked to diseases, such as allergies and skin rashes in both humans and animals. Acid rain has been linked to gases given off by fireworks, which sometimes go beyond the toxin  limits of the United States Clean Air Act.\nOnce all those chemicals come back down to the ground, they can cause problems too. Debris   from the fireworks falls to the ground, where animals can burn their paws or noses on piping hot pieces. Humans also are at risk of stepping on or picking up something sharp or hot. Meanwhile, debris that finds its way into waterways can damage animal habitats and water supply sources.\nInstead of setting off fireworks, try to come up with some new ways for fun. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n* Sky lanterns--a tradition that originated long ago in the most-populated Asian country.\n* Party crackers--a favorite in the United Kingdom--give you noise and surprises without the mess of fireworks. You can make your own or buy eco-friendly crackers.\n* Want noise excitement with less volume? Consider a fireworks sound recording beforehand or break out the party horns   and blow up a storm!",
