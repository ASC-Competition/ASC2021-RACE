  "article": "Finding summer jobs for teenagers has not always been easy, but now you no longer have to worry about what your kid can do to earn their own money.Recently I found some different sites online that offer information about what kids can do.Below is some of that information, along with questions to think about to help you come up with your own ideas.\nIdeas for summer work\n*Parks and Recreation Programs.\n*Babysitting   during the day of school.\n*Working part-time at a day care for the summer.\n*Car washing.\n*Working at local vegetable stands.\nThe easiest way for you to find ways for your child to make money is to think about others' inconveniences  .Think of things you need done, or would like to have done, and what you would consider paying for these things to get done.Once you have some ideas, you can sit down with your child and talk to them about what they would be interested in doing.Then once you have an idea of what they want to do you can help them come up with fair prices.\nPreferably you would want to only have your child working with people you know and trust, or in the least bit you could have your child pick a partner.That way with each of them carrying cell phones, even those without service can call 911, they will be much safer.\nYou can find out more information and many more ideas for kids to use to make money during their summer holidays by visiting http//www.kidswantmoney.com.",
