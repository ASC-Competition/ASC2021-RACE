He wanted to give her a present. On his way home from hospital, he bought some beautiful flowers in a shop. When doctor Carl got home, he gave his wife the flowers and said, \"Happy birthday to you, dear!\" \"It's April 20th today. I remembered your birthday this year.\" Mrs. Carl laughed and said, \"My birthday was the day before yesterday, but thank you all the same. Better late than never!\"",
