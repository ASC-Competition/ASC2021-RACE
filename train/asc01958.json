  "article": "I was waiting in a check-in line at Arlanda International Airport. The man ahead of me was quite a big guy. As an airport baggage handler checked through a customer at the roadside, he accidentally knocked over the man's luggage. He quickly collected the fallen bags and apologized for his mistake. However,the traveler burst into anger, shouting at the baggage handler for his carelessness.\nThe baggage handler calmly apologized and smiled all the time. The customer continued to berate  the man, even as he turned away and headed for his gate. Through it all the baggage handler smiled and remained calm.\nThe other customers in line witnessed the incident and admired the baggage handler's professionalism and self-control. \"I have never seen such restraint and humility,\" one of the customers sighed, \"How do you keep your cool when somebody is attacking you so viciously?\"\n\"It's easy,\" the baggage handler answered. \"He's going to London, but his bags are going to Tokyo.\"\nI won't recommend that we use revenge to relieve stress. But let me tell you about one of my friends who has found a way to go through most of his life unaffected by the _ that disturbs most people. He is one of the calmest people I've ever known and he describes how he keeps his cool no matter how turbulent a situation becomes. He says, \"I look at it this way. A traffic jam has no power to make me angry. It just stops my car. And that's the way I try to look at most of what happens to me.\" With that philosophy, this guy goes through life with a calmness I can only envy.\nMy friend likes to say things like, \"A rude customer has no power to make me angry; he just fusses.\" And, \"A mistake I made has no power to make me upset; it's just a chance to do better.\" He shows how we can truly find calmness in the midst of chaos.",
