  "article": "Once there lived a man in a small town. He often said, \"If I have lots of gold , I shall be the happiest man in the world.\" One day he was traveling in North Africa. He lost his way and he was so hungry and thirsty that he couldn't walk any more. There were only stones and sand around. Just then he saw a bag on the sand. He took it up. But when he opened it, he saw it was full of gold. He left the bag on the sand and cried, \"What is the use of gold to a hungry man?\"",
