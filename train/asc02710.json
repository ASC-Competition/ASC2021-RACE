  "article": "Do you always forget where you placed your keys or your purse? What was the name of the movie you saw last week? The major cause of your forgetfulness may be linked to what you store in your body, not in your short-term memory bank.\nTests continue to show that people with enough Vitamin B-2 do well in memory exams. The \"B\" could stand for \"brain\", if you're one of many with limited instant recall. And the number one source of that vitamin   is sunflower seeds.\nEven when you're sleeping or relaxing, your brain is still at work. Although it makes up just two percent of your total body weight, it uses up to 30 % of the calories   you take in each day. For it to work properly, it must be fed. Even if you're not a breakfast eater, that meal is the best way to prepare your brain for the day. A quick and easy English _ with peanut and butter in it, a glass of milk, and an orange, might be what your brain may be asking you the first thing in the morning when you feel your head is in a fog. Having sunflower seeds and fruit between meals adds more muscle to that hungry, demanding organ. Vitamin B-1 also helps the memory, and that is found in eggs, meats and nuts. In Chinese culture, walnuts are known as the fruit for a long life because it is believed that they feed both the kidneys and the brain. And according to Chinese culture, if you keep those two important organs in good working order, you'll live longer.\nHowever forgetful you are, just keep in mind the letter \"B\", which will help you to \"bear in mind almost everything\" even on those days when life's challenges are sending you in a billion directions.",
