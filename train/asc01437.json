  "article": "Dog owners now have a little help understanding their furry friends.A new device  called Bow-Lingual \"translates\" dog barks into English, Korean or Japanese.Bow-Lingual Japanese inventors spent much time and money analyzing dog barks.They found that dog noises can be broken down into six different emotions: happiness, sadness, frustration, anger, assertion and desire.\nPart of the Bow-Lingual device hangs on the dog's collar.The other part is a handle-held unit for the owner.When the dog barks, the unit displays translated phrases.\nSome people have _ at Bow-Lingual.\"Who would pay $120 to read a dog's mind?\" they ask.\nBut those who have purchased  Bow-Lingual praise the device.Pet owner Keiko Egawa, of Japan, says it helps her sympathize  with her dog Harry.\"Before we go to the park, he always says he wants to play,\" says Egawa, \"and after a walk, he always says he is hungry.\"\nBow-Lingual is not yet available  in Chinese.So you'd better keep studying Studio Classroom, or soon your dog may know more English than you do!",
