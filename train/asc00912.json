  "article": "often teach about happiness and what has become clear is this:There are some qualities always unhappy people have.Here are some of them.\nHappy people know life can be hard and tend to live through hard times.They take responsibility for how they got themselves into a mess,and focus on getting themselves out of it as soon as possible.Unhappy people see themselves as victims of life and stay stuck in the\"look what happened to me\" attitude instead of finding a way through and out to the other side.\nMost happy people believe in the good in people instead of thinking everyone is out to get them.Generally open and friendly towards people they meet,happy people foster a sense of community around themselves and meet new people with all open heart.Unhappy people are distrustful of most people they meet and don't think strangers can be trusted.Unfortunately,this behavior slowly closes all chances of meeting new friends.\nUnhappy people believe someone else's good fortune steals from their own.They believe there's not enough goodness to go around and always compare others'against theirs.This leads to jealousy .Happy people know that others'good luck and circumstance are just signs of what they also can achieve if they try hard enough.They believe in unlimited possibilities and don't get stuck in thinking one person's good fortune limits their possible outcome in life.\nThere's only so much space between the two ears.Unhappy people fill that space with constant worry and fear.Happy people experience fear and worry too,but make an important difference between feeling it and living with it.When fear or worry crosses a happy person's mind,they'll ask themselves if there's an action they can take to prevent their fear or worry from happening and they take it.If not,they realize they're spinning in fear and they lay it down.",
