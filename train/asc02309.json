Smart socks, which can teach to dance, may be the answer for _ \nThe socks have been developed as a running tool to help runners improve their skills.

A recent study showed that between 60 and 80percent of runners got hurt per year. This is pretty much more than any other human activity. Researchers say the technology can also be developed to teach people how to dance, play sports such golf, or even to help to teach women to walk better in high heels.\nMr. Vigano said, \"People could all benefit from the idea.

It could even be put in high heels to help women walk in them safely.\"\nSocks are just the start, and the technology could be used in gloves, hats and boots.
