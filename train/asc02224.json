  "article": "Perhaps Joe Cheng has become popular with thousands of fans and has been chased by girls and middles students. But do you know his resume ?\nYes. Joe Cheng, who plays the most popular boy in high school in the popular Taiwanese drama \"It Started with a Kiss.\"\nAlthough thousands of girls have fallen in love with him for his cute smile and strong body, Cheng, 27, doesn't want to rest on his good looks. He made the move from modeling to acting six years ago, and now he is trying another career-this time, to be a singer. Cheng worked on his first album, \"Joe Cheng's Day\", for a year. It came out on September 7.\nApart from recording his CD, Cheng has been practicing dance moves for his music video. Given his height, 188cm, this was not an easy job. \"I had bad dreams about dancing,\" he said.\nCheng's life has had many ups and downs. His parents divorced when he was in primary school and he has lived with his father ever since. After dropping out of high school, he took on all kinds of jobs before being spotted by a scout for a modeling agency. Cheng said his key to life is \"keeping a positive _ and making the most out of life.\"\nCheng admitted that he got bad grades when he was in high school. But he was still very popular at school. \"Being very active in the students union, I was elected president. I liked to organize parties and field trips, so many teachers and students knew me,\" he said.\nCheng once dreamed of becoming a cartoonist, and he regrets that he never did it. Now he hopes his teenage fans can learn from his life. \"When you are in school, just focus on studies,\" Cheng said. \"Every young heart is eager to explore the world outside. But take your time. Finish your studies first.\"",
