  "article": "Dear Mum:\nToday I'm going to tell you something really special. I know you work very hard and feel tired every day.\nEvery time you come home and see the messy  house. I know you are very angry with me. But you always say nothing and clean up the house .I always want to help you, but I have so much homework to do. After I finish my homework, I feel like dying. I really want to help you, but I'm so tired too.\nI also want to tell you one thing, I love you so much. I usually talk back to you when you say that I don't study hard enough. But in fact I just want you to praise  me more. I will try my best to get good grades and get praise from my teacher. So don't feel frustrated  about my grades, OK? I have made up my mind that I will study harder and help you to clean the house. I am serious this time. I will have my homework done faster so that I can have more energy to clean the house. I will watch TV less so that I can have more time to study and get good grades. All these things are for one reason: I want to make you happy Mum.\nI love you!\nWith lots of love Sally",
