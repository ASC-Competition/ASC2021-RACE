This clock has four faces, so no matter  where you stand, you can read the time on the face of Big Ben. Each face is the size of a double-decker  bus.\nThe hands are about four meters long. It is about the size of two people standing on top of each other. If you go to London, you may want to visit the House of Parliament . You will find Big Ben sitting at the top of the clock tower  in the House of Parliament. You will hear it as well as  you see it.
