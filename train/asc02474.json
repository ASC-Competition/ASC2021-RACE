  "article": "Seated in a convertible   with the top down at 60 miles an hour, Mary looked at the flies that sat on top of Mark's hair. How could they stay there? She wondered.\nMary had not seen Mark in years, until the other day when he came into the cafe where she worked. His appearance was different from when he was in high school. Now, he was a bit fat and thick glasses covered his eyes. However, that didn't change Mary's feelings for him at all. He had just bought a brand new red sports car and asked her if she would like to go for a ride and then have dinner with him. Her heart beat with excitement as he opened the door for her. She noticed something very strange as Mark got into the car and started to drive away. On the hair was a group of flies just sitting there.\nMary stared in amazement. It seemed the faster they drove, the more determined the flies were to stick to his hair.\nMary remained silent. She leaned forward and turned the radio on, to try to _ her attention away from the flies, but she couldn't help thinking about them. She looked up at Mark, who was completely devoted to what was going on and continued to sing to the music while driving merrily along.\nFinally, Mark pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road beside a diner and looked in the mirror and said, \"Mary, I would like to comb my hair before we get something to eat. Could you reach under the seat and give me my hair cream?\"\nMary reached under the seat and pulled out a camping backpack, which contained a round jar and started to laugh wildly as she pointed to the label  .\n\"That's not hair cream on your hair, Mark! It says it's Fly Trap Glue!\"",
