  "article": "Peter waved goodbye and closed the door slowly as Jane left home to visit her grandmother. Expecting a whole day to relax, he was thinking whether to read the newspaper or watch his favorite TV talk show on his first day off in months. \"This will be like a walk in the park,\" he'd told his wife, \"I'll look after the kids, and you can go to visit your grandma.\"\nThings started well, but just after eight o'clock, his three little \"good kids\"--Adam, Bob, and Christopher--came down the stairs in their night clothes and shouted \"breakfast, daddy.\" When food had not appeared within thirty seconds, Adam began using his spoon on Christopher's head as if it were a drum. Christopher started to shout loudly in time to the beat  . Bob chanted \"Where's my toast, where's my toast\" in the background. Peter realized his newspaper would have to wait for a few seconds.\nLife became worse after breakfast. Adam wore Bob's underwear on his head. Bob locked himself in the bathroom, while Christopher shouted again because he was going to wet his pants. Nobody could find clean socks, although they were before their very eyes. Someone named \"Not Me\" had spilled a whole glass of orange juice into the basket of clean clothes. Peter knew the talk show had already started.\nBy ten o'clock, things were out of control. Christopher was wondering why the fish in the jar refused his bread and butter. Adam was trying to show off his talent by decorating the kitchen wall with his color pencils. Bob, thankfully, appeared to be reading quietly in the family room, but closer examination showed that he was eating apple jam straight from the bottle with his hands. Peter realized that the talk show was over and reading would be impossible.\nAt exactly 11:17, Peter called the daycare centre  .\"I suddenly have to go into work and my wife's away. Can I bring the boys over in a few minutes?\" The answer was obviously \"yes\" because Peter was smiling.",
