  "article": "Once Effendi had a joke with the Prime Minister  . He said that the Minister would die the next day. The next day, the Minister fell to the ground from the horse and really died. When the king learned this, he got angry and sent his men to catch Effendi at once.\nWhen Effendi was brought to him, the king shouted angrily, \"Effendi, since  you knew when my Minister would die, you must know the date of your own death. Say it out, or you'll die today.\"\nEffendi looked at the king for a while. Then he answered, \"But how can I know? I'll die two days earlier than you.\" The king was afraid that if he killed Effendi, he himself would die after that. He thought he must keep Effendi alive   as long as possible, so he let Effendi go.",
