  "article": "Gwendolyn Brooks wrote hundreds of poems during her lifetime. She was known around the world for using poetry to increase understanding of black culture in America.\nDuring the 1940's and the 1950's, Gwendolyn Brooks used her poems to describe conditions among the poor,racial  inequality and drug use in the black community. She also wrote poems about the struggles of black women.\nBut her skill was more than her ability to write about struggling black people. She combined traditional European poetry styles with the African American experience.\nGwendolyn Brooks once said that she wrote about what she saw and heard in the street. She said she found most of her materials through looking out of the window of her second-floor apartment in Chicago, Illinois.\nIn her early poetry, Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about the South Side of Chicago, where many black people live. In her poems, the South Side is called Bronzeville. It was \"A Street in Bronzeville\" that gained the attention of literary experts in 1945. Critics praised her poetic skills and her powerful descriptions about the black experience during the time. The Bronzeville poems were her first published collection.\nIn 1950, Gwendolyn Brooks became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Literature. She won the prize for her second book of poems called \"Annie Allen\". \"Annie Allen\" is a collection of poetry about a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother. She experiences loneliness, loss, death andpoverty .\nGwendolyn Brooks said that winning the prize changed her life.\nHer next work was a novel written in 1953 called \"Maud Martha\". \"Maud Martha\" attracted little attention when it was first published. But now it is considered an important work by some critics. Its main ideas about the difficult lives of many women are popular among female writers today.",
