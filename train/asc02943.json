  "article": "In the past few decades, Japanese cuisine  has acquired global appeal. Japanese restaurants have sprung up almost all over the world. In Kyoto, the Heihachi Tea House boasts a 430-year-old tradition that the owners have kept all in the family. The tea house has been operated by twenty generations of the Sonobe family.\nThe Heihachi Tea House, in the northern part of Kyoto, is one of the city's oldest business establishments. It is said to have opened in 1576. The present owner, Sonobe Heihachi, who is also the chef, represents the 20th generation of the Sonobe family to oversee the tea house.\nSonobe Heihachi, restaurant owner, said, \"During the middle of the Edo era, from 1603 to 1868, it became customary for commoners to dine in mat rooms. The Heihachi Tea House specialized in a dish comprised of rice with barley . It then became an inn and a little later, a restaurant.\"\nLike every other chef, Sonobe Heihachi's day often begins at the market where he personally selects ingredients that will be served to his customers. The restaurant specializes in a style of cuisine known as Kaiseki Ryori--possibly the ultimate in Japanese cooking. It offers both fresh and ocean fishes on its menu, including bream and eels. The owner's son Sonobe Shingo is also an accomplished chef. His skills include the elaborate cutting of a \"daikon\" radish   into strips. Later they will be shredded into thin strands to form part of the garnish  for sashimi.\nSonobe Shingo admits that when it comes to the small details of running the business, father and son have different ways of thinking. Sometimes they clash.\nBut they share a passion for what they do and continue to preserve an innovative and deeply rooted culinary  tradition.",
