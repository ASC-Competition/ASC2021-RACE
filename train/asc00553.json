  "article": "Which city would you prefer to visit, London or Paris?London had welcomed 16.8 million foreign visitors in 2014, compared with 15.2 million visitors to Paris, according to a new report released by UK research firm Euromonitor International in January.\nBoris Johnson, London's mayor, is very proud.\"With so many fascinating museums, the best theater scene in the world, more green space than any other European city, numerous top sporting venues , a low crime rate and much else besides, it is no wonder that people from all over the globe are flocking   to London in record numbers. These figures prove that London is without doubt the greatest city on the planet,\"he told The Telegraph.\nHowever, Paris' mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is not as pleased. \"London is in some ways a suburb of Paris,\" she said.The Huffington Post used the word \" _ \" to describe these back-and-forth insults  . It refers to arguments about unimportant things, like small children fighting over a toy, or lovers arguing over the TV remote.\nFrance and Britain are separated only by the English Channel. For centuries, they fought over territory  .But in fact, Paris and London are very similar. Both are centers of fashion and the arts. Even their most famous landmarks are a little similar --- the Palace of Versailles outside Paris and Buckingham Palace in London, for example.\nThat's the trouble - they're as good as each other. As the Daily Mail put it: London and Paris are \"head-to-head\" in their battle for supremacy. In fact, visitors to these great cities love them equally.Hidalgo also wrote an article in The Telegraph, but changed her words slightly: \"London is a suburb of Paris and Paris is a suburb of London.\"Does this mean these two cities could one day \"grow up\", stop bickering, and become friends.",
