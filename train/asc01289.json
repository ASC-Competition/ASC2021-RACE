  "article": "There is famous story about British poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.He was writing a poem when he was interrupted by a knock at the door.\nThis was an age before telephones.Someone was delivering a message.When Colcridge got back to his poem, he had lost his inspiration.His poetic mood had been broken by the knock on his\ndoor.His unfinished poem, which could otherwise have been a masterpiece, would now never be more than a fragment(,).\nThis story tells how unexpected communication can destroy an important thought, which brings us to the cell phone.\nThe most common complaint about cell phones is that people talk on them to the annoyance of people around them.But marc damaging may be the cell phone's disruption of our thoughts.\nWe have already entered a golden age of little white lies about our call phones, and this is by and large a healthy, productive development.\" I didn't hear it ring\" or \" I didn't realize my cell phone had shut off\" arc among the lies we tell to give ourselves space where we're beyond reach.\nThe notion or idea of being unreachable is not a new concept-we havoc \"Do Not Disturb\" signs on the doors of hotel rooms. So why must we feel guilty when it comes to cell phones? Why must we apologize if we decide to shut off the phone for a while?\nThe problem is that we come from a long-established tradition of difficulty with distance communication.Until the recent mass deployment of cell phones, it was easy to communicate with someone next to us or a few feet away, but difficult with someone across town, the country or the\nglobe.We came to take it for granted.\nBut cell phones make long-distance communication common, and endanger our time by ourselves.Now time alone, or conversation with someone next to us which cannot be interrupted by a phone, is something to be cherished.Even cell phone devotees, myself usually included, can't help at times wanting to throw their cell phone away, or curse the day they were invented.\nBut we don't and won't, and there really is no need.All that's required to take back our private time is a general social recognition that we have the right to it.\nIn other words, we have to develop a healthy contempt for the rings of our phones.Given the case of making and receiving cell phone calls, if we don-t talk to the caller right now, we surely will shortly later.\nA cell phone call deserves no greater priority than a random word from a person next to us.Though the call on my cell phone may be the one-in-a-million from Steven Spielberg-who has  finally read my novel and wants to make it his next movie.But most likely it is not, and I'm better\noff thinking about the idea I just had for a new story, or the pizza I'll eat for lunch.",
