  "article": "Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children (MGHfC) have invented a new term that describes dangers associated with cigarette smoke: third-hand smoke. Study results published in January, 2009 discuss how third-hand smoke is especially dangerous for children.\nHave you ever walked into a room that had the smell of cigarette smoke, regardless of the fact that a fan was moving the air and no one was smoking at the time? This is what researchers are calling third-hand smoke -- and it represents the poisonous deposits   that are left behind long after a cigarette is put out.\nCigarette smoke contains gases and small particles that are deposited on every surface it comes in contact with, for example, the smoker's hair and clothing, or the environment the cigarette was smoked in. It's dangerous for young children who may crawl on polluted surfaces. Third-hand smoke is a serious health risk for our kids, especially those who live in the homes of smokers.\nJonathan Winickoff, lead author of the study, explains, \"When you come into contact with your baby, even if you're not smoking at the time, he or she comes in contact with those poisons. And if you breast-feed, the poisons will transfer to your baby in your breast milk.\" Winickoff adds however, that nursing a baby if you're a smoker is still a better choice than bottle-feeding.\nResearchers involved in the study also surveyed more than 1,500 families in an effort to learn about adult attitudes regarding the danger third-hand smoke represents to their children and how that might affect smoking in the home.\nApproximately 95 percent of nonsmokers and 84 percent of smokers believe that secondhand smoke is dangerous for children.\nOn the issue of whether third-hand smoke threatens the health of children, 65 percent of nonsmokers and 43 percent of smokers felt that third-hand smoke harms kids. When asked about rules regarding smoking in the home, approximately 88 percent of nonsmokers said they don't allow smoking, while only 27 percent of smokers forbid smoking in the home.\nHowever, both non-smokers and smokers who felt that third-hand smoking was harmful to children's health were more inclined to   restrict smoking in their homes.",
