  "article": "An ant was drinking at a small river and fell in. She tried her best to reach the side, but she couldn't move at all. The poor ant got too tired but was still doing her best when a big bird saw her. What a luck! The bird threw a piece of wood in the water. With it the ant reached the bank again. While she was resting and drying herself in the grass, she heard a man coming up. He was walking without shoes on his feet and with a gun in his hand. As soon as he saw the bird, he wanted to kill her, and he would certainly do so, but the ant bite him on one of his feet and at the moment the bird flew away at once.",
