  "article": "This site contains 100 original short stories about life in America. These stories are written for ESL(English as a second language ) learners who are, at least, high beginners. We want to help ESL students learn English as quickly and effortlessly as possible. Learning should be interesting, not boring. We hope that learners will find that these stories are of some help to improve their English.\nThe stories have interesting topics and are easy to understand. Each story comes with an audio narrative so that learners can listen as they read. The audio requires downloading the free Real Player. Each story contains a search for pictures, definitions, and pronunciation.\" Following each story are four sets of exercises, and each containing 10 items.\nExercise A is \"Yes / No Questions\". The learner is asked questions like, \"Does Sara have children?\" The learner can then type in, \"Yes, she does.\" Then the learner can check whether it's the right answer or not.\nExercise B is \"Wh-Questions\". The learner is asked questions like, \"Where does Sara live?\" The learner can then type in, \"She lives in Pasadena.\" Then the learner can check his answer.\nExercise C is \"Ask Questions\". The learner is given an answer like, \"They have two children.\" The learner must then type in a question like, \"How many children do they have?\"The learner can then check to see whether he is correct or not. Exercise D is \"Dictation\". The learner listens to a sentence. Most of the sentences duplicate  the sentences in the stories. The learner types the dictation and then checks to see whether he is correct or not.\nWork on the site is in progress. Help us make it better as the years go by. We welcome all comments, suggestions, complaints, new ideas, and questions. Click here to send us emails.",
