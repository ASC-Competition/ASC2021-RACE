  "article": "Neither rain nor snow nor the dark of night can separate Tennessee postal carrier \"Mailman Mike\" from his 4-and-a-half-year-old friend Carter Lawson - or keep them from their appointments.\nFor the past nine months, the two have teamed up every day in the preschooler's Knoxville neighborhood for a few minutes of delivering mail together and chatting with fellow neighbors. Lawson wants to be a mail carrier when he grows up, and in an inspiring story, his mom told us how mailman Mike Crenshaw has been a role model to her son. \"Anyone could just be like 'Go away, kid', but Mike has really gone out of his way to talk with Carter,\" said Cassie Lawson of the United States Postal Service carrier. Little Carter even got his own uniform to match Mike's. \"It's been really cute. I just couldn't believe he got a full mailman's costume,\" the postal service employee said.\n\"Every letter carrier has stops he looks forward to and this is the one I look forward to every day,\" said Mike. \"He's the end of my day, and the best part of my day. Not because it's the end, but because he's such a cute little guy.\"\nThe man and the little boy's connection isn't a surprise to Fredric Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers. \"Kids respond to mailmen because letter carriers are a friendly, uniformed part of the neighborhood who bring something to their house every day, and are someone they come to recognize and trust,\" Rolando said. \"It's the same for the elderly, but in addition, letter carriers may be the only person they communicate with all day.\"",
