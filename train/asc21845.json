  "article": "You may know the word \"astronaut\".But do you know the word \"taikonaut\"? It means \"Chinese astronaut\" in English.It comes from the Chinese pinyin \"taikong\" and the English word \"astronaut\".In 1998.a Malaysian Chinese scientist used the word for the first time.Since then,because of the fast development of China's space industry,more and more people all over the world have known the word.In September,2008,taikonauts caught many people's eyes again.\nThe Shenzhou-7 spacecraft that carried three taikonauts took off from China's Jiuquan\nSatellite Launch Center on September 25th.It's the third time for China to send people into space.During the flight in space.some tasks were completed and the 20-minute spacewalk was the most exciting one.With the help of his two teammates Liu Boming and Jing Haipeng,Chinese taikonaut Zhai Zhigang completed China's first spacewalk.China has become the third country to finish such an outer space activity following Russia and the U.S.A.All the Chinese people are proud of our country.",
