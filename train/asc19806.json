  "article": "Many children love to play with snow in winter. But Long Chuan has come to hate it.\nThis year his hometown suffered from snowstorms   for nearly a month. The heavy snow stopped cars and trains, broke the electricity   tower and turned tap water to ice.\nEvery day Long Chuan had to walk several kilometers to carry drinking water. \"I couldn't ride a bike and it took me 3 hours to walk to school. I can't remember how many times I slipped   on the hard ice, \" said Long Chuan.\nLong is not alone. This year millions of people in central and southern China had a freezing winter without enough water and electricity. The biggest snowstorms in 50 years killed more than 100 people. They also cost the country 111.1 billion yuan.\nExperts   say a special type of climate condition  , La Nina, caused the storms. During a La Nina, the water in the Pacific Ocean   near the equator   becomes colder than usual. It changes the weather around the world.\nBesides China, Canada, the US and Middle Eastern countries also met with heavy snowstorms this winter. The special climate caused the recent flooding   in Australia, too.\nHowever, experts say that people have destroyed the environment  . Global warming   may be causing these terrible weather events to happen more and more often.",
