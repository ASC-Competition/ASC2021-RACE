  "article": "Hi, my name is Han Meimei. I'm in the Photography   Club at school, because I like taking photos. Next Sunday, the club will have an activity. In the morning, we are going to meet at Guangming Bridge at 8:30 am. It is in the middle of the city. It is near my home so I will go there on foot. The scenery   along the bridge is fantastic, so we will take photos there. We are going to spend two hours doing that. After having lunch together, we are going to the clothing show. There will be many beautiful clothes. There will be some famous designers , too. I'm looking forward to taking photos with them. And I hope some of them can write their names in my notebook.",
