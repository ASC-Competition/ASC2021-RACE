For many years, people killed countless great white sharks in the waters around the United States.\nBut thanks to conservation   efforts, great whites are making a comeback in the U.S. Two recent studies show that the population of these sharks is rising along the east and west coast.\nWhy is the growing population of a killer fish something to celebrate? \"When you fish too many of them, you start to lose balance in the environment,\" says shark researcher Tobey Curtis. As the biggest killer, sharks help keep the populations of fish, seals, and other creatures they eat from growing too large.\nIn spite of their importance, great white sharks had long been hunted for their meat and their fins  . Then, in 1997, the U.S. government passed a law that didn't allow the hunting of great whites. Afterwards, the numbers of these sharks in the U.S. waters started to increase.\nThe law wasn't the only thing that has helped great whites. Conservationists have also played a part in the sharks' comeback. The research group OCEARCH is using a method called tagging   to help change people's attitudes about great white. They let the public follow each shark as it travels the world's oceans. OCEARCH also gives each tagged shark a name to help people form a closer connection with the big fish.\nThe group's most well-known shark is named Katharine. She was tagged last year near Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since then, thousands of people have tracked Katharine's movements on Twitter and the OCEARCH website.\nThis helps people see sharks in a new way. Chris Fischer, the founder of OCEARCH believes learning to appreciate great whites will encourage people to do more to protect them.",
