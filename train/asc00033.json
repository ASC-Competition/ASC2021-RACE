  "article": "Welcome to our homepage!\nWe've teamed up with two travel agencies to give members of our club the chance to win a holiday to the South of France or one to the Maldives.\nThe winner and their three guests will enjoy a seven-night getaway   at the Villa Le Priotlet -- a centuries old stone villa   set on the banks of the Dordogne River. This property has been lovingly restored and furnished, and is ideal for small families to relax surrounded by peaceful views and gentle countryside. The beautiful gardens surrounding the property are full of seasonal treats for you to pick and enjoy, including figs, pears and grapes. The property is also situated just 15 minutes from the UNESCO World Heritage site of Saint-Emilion, which has been producing some of the world's best wine since Roman times.\nWe'll also give another lucky member a seven-night stay for two people on their island tour to the Maldives. With white sand beaches, coconut trees and blue warm seas, the Maldives is a must-see destination. Accompanied by a local guide, guests have the chance to combine island life with cultural activities, as well as experiencing all those things for which the Maldives are famous: diving and snorkeling   and relaxation. The guesthouse accommodation is handpicked   to provide a balance of comfort, good service and local atmosphere.\nTo enter this competition, click on \"enter competition\" in the information box below.",
