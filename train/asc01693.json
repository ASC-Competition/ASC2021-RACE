  "article": "Before your child's final exam: and the graduation announcements, you face a significant task together: choosing the right college or university. There is no \"one size fits all\" approach to selecting a college--it's a very personal process for most teenagers. Consider a wide range of factors to help your child make the best possible choice.\nDiscuss with your child her post-high school choices, such as college, finding work or starting a business, or joining the army. If you determine together that college is the best choice for your child, talk about the importance of college, and her longer-term goals by going to college.\nTalk to your child about what she thinks is important in a college experience and share your opinions as well. Identify the issues that will directly impact her college choice, such as her grades, test scores and family finances. Then make a list of the key criteria for her dream school, including factors such as the school's location, its size, the types of prograM:, the after school activities available and the type of financial aid available.\n _ the item: on your child's list, at least to the extent of sorting it into \"must-haves,\" \"highly desirable\" and \"nice-to-have\" categories. Put these factors into an online search engine specifically designed to identify colleges and universities that best meet your criteria, such as that offered by CollegeBoard.org. Start with the most important criteria, then experiment with additional factors to narrow the search results to a number you can work with, such as 10 or 20 different schools.\nUse the search results as a guide to further focus your college search. Research each school by reviewing its website, requesting information directly from the school and attending local presentations about the school.",
