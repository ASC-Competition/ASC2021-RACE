  "article": "The younger generation  , according to a new survey, can hardly remember the last time of climbing trees or flying kites, as they are kept indoors and short of outdoor experiences.\nThe survey of 1,000 people found that the current   generation of 15- to 34-year-olds have fewer memories   of 12 key countryside activities such as swimming in rivers or going fishing.\nThe research found that three quarters of the older generation remembered playing games or climbing trees, compared with two thirds of younger adults.\nThe 55+generation also had more memories of collecting stones, visiting a farm or pond dipping. Altogether, two thirds of older people had more memories of playing outdoors compared to just over half of the younger generation.\nThe Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) carried out the study at the start of the school term to stress the growing worry that children are not getting outdoors enough.\nThe study has found that 82 per cent of people think that schools should provide more outdoor education and most believe nature is still important to children today.\nDr. Mike Clarke, head of the RSPB, said children who are usually kept indoors are easier to get \" _ \". He said public money should be used to take children on day trips to nature and to build wildlife gardens, especially in poor areas.\n\"To many people, it would seem clear and unquestionable that an important part of childhood is exploring the world around you. Unfortunately, this is far from the fact and the children are having less time and fewer chances to get close to nature,\" he said.\n\"The RSPB has more than a 40-year history in getting children outdoors and is still continuing to play our role. We now need the government and the schools to realize that they should play the most important role in making it possible for all the children to experience, enjoy and benefit   from the outdoor environment.\"",
