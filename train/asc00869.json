  "article": "The story began with a young mother who had three sons. Unfortunately, the youngest son developed slow thinking skills, not having the intelligence of his brothers.\nWith double duty as the mother of the household, she was exhausted, so that the youngest was often the target of anger and annoyance. Bad words, such as \"you little fool\" and the like, served as a daily meal for the youngest.\nThe words and curses he got from the mother and ridicule from friends convinced him that he was distressing and embarrassing his family. Every morning he woke up with his own face staring from the mirror reflection, he started to say quietly and sadly, \"The fool is going to school.\"\nAs adult citizens, there was compulsory military service which should be lived. Thus, the youngest son also signed up and started to follow the various tests: a medical, physical ability test and other tests. On the day of the announcement, he was called into the board of examiners.\nIn his mind, he convinced himself that he was the fool and couldn't pass the tests this time as he entered the room with his head down. It was not expected at all. The tests turned out to have the highest praise from the board of examiners.\n\"Congratulations, young man! Your test results are incredible! You are really a great and talented young man. \"Words from the board of examiners became the discovery of a new side of himself that was not known in advance. Voice kept echoing in his mind, such as \"I, the great man, am in the shower\", \"The great man washes his face\", \"The talented young man again brushes his teeth\" and so on. Confidence and improved self-image came beyond usual.\n20 years later, the youngest established himself as a successful businessman who was admired and respected, and received many awards.\nThe mindset and belief are the power behind the success that is within us. Whatever we think and believe in or minds continuously, it will eventually materialize in reality. That's the universally applicable law.",
