  "article": "You may know about \" junk food\" like French fries. But do you know about \"junk sleep\"?\nRecently, a British survey found that electronic  products in teenagers bedrooms are affecting their sleep.\nThe survey was done among 1,000 British kids from 12 to 16. It found that thirty percent of them got just 4 to 7 hours sleep every day. But doctors say they need 8 to 9 hours.\nAlmost a quarter of the kids said they fell asleep more than once a week while watching TV, listening to music or using other electronic products.\n\"This is very worrying.\" Said Dr Chris Idzikowski, a British expert, \"We call it 'junk sleep', It means you don't get enough sleep and the quality of the sleep is bad, too. If you don't get good rest, you don't perform well in school the next day.\"\nThe survey found that 40 percent of the kids felt tired each day, with girls between 13 and 16 feeling the worst. Nearly all the teenagers have a phone, Mp4 or TV IN THEIR BEDROOM. And many of them have all three.",
