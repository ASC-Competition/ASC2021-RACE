  "article": "Napoleon, as a character in Tolstoy's War and Peace, is more than once described as having \"fat little hands\". Nor does he \"sit well or firmly on the horse\". He is said to be \"undersized\", with \"short legs\" and a \"round stomach\". The issue here is not the accuracy of Tolstoy's description-it seems not that far off from historical accounts but his choice of facts: other things that could be said of the man are not said. We are meant to understand the difference of a warring commander in the body of a fat little Frenchman. Tolstoy's Napoleon could be any man wandering in the streets and putting a little of powdered tobacco up his nose-and that is the point.\nIt is a way the novelist uses to show the moral nature of a character. And it turns out that, as Tolstoy has it, Napoleon is a crazy man. In a scene in Book Three of War and Peace, the wars having reached the critical year of 1812,Napoleon receives a representative from the Tsar   ,who has come with peace terms. Napoleon is very angry: doesn't he have more army? He, not the Tsar, is the one to make the terms. He will destroy all of Europe if his army is stopped. \"That is what you will have gained by engaging me in the war!\" he shouts. And then, Tolstoy writes, Napoleon \"walked silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders moving quickly\".\nStill later, after reviewing his army amid cheering crowds, Napoleon invites the shaken Russian to dinner. \"He raised his hand to the Russian's face,\" Tolstoy writes, and \"taking him by the ear pulled it gently. . . \". To have one's ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the French court. \"Well, well, why don't you say anything?\" said he, as if it was ridiculous in his presence to respect any one but himself, Napoleon.\nTolstoy did his research, but the composition is his own.",
