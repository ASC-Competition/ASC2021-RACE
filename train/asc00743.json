  "article": "In jokes, the chicken only crosses the road. In Australia,cane toads   use roads to travel.\nA new study finds that Cane toads are using roads to spread across the continent.   They take shelter overnight close to the opencorridors  , and then hit the road each evening in their damaging way.\nCane toads were brought into Australia from Hawaii in 1935 to control the spread ofbeetles  that were destroying Australia's sugar cane crop. _ are now moving into new places at the speed of 30 miles a year.\nToads can grow as large as dinner plates and can weigh up to 4.5 pounds. Their heads and backsides are covered with rows ofwarts . They are known to kill snakes, lizards and other animals, including pet dogs. They have no natural enemy in Australia.\nAccording to a research, toads make slower progress through thick plants than along open spaces and they hop   alongside roads and fences whenever possible. Toads use long corridors that are well-suited for them to travel long distances.\nAnother study recently found that toads haveevolved   longer legs in recent years and that this is also helping them in their spread.\nEfforts to kill toads have been largely unsuccessful, although scientists tried their best.\nAnother new finding suggests ways to slow down its population.  For example, roadside borders can be changed to make them less attractive to toads, or allowing thick plants to grow along the sides of highways, thus forcing toads onto the road of themselves.",
