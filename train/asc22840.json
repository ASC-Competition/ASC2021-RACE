Now, I can have a delicious dessert .\"\nWhen Cindy comes home from work in the evening, the ice cream is not there and her husband says, \"Oh, you see the fridge   is broken . It's not cold at all.\" \"Really?\" Cindy says. And at the same time, she put her husband's arm into the fridge. Cindy says \"Keep it in the fridge for an hour. Don't move it away before I come back.\" She goes to cook dinner. \"Oh, no.\" her husband shouts loudly.",
