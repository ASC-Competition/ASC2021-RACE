  "article": "I come to the United States ten year ago. I would always say that I was trying to study, but there were always things like work and my kids that would not allow me to start.\nNow I realized that those were only excuses. What stopped me was that I was afraid to start studying again. I always believed I would learn by myself.\nOne day, however, my son told me that he was sad because his friends would come over and I didn't understand them because I didn't speak English. He was also sad because I could never help him with his homework. That same day, I told myself, \"Rocio, you have to start believing in yourself and you will see you can make it.\"\nThe next day, I went downtown to look for a big banner   in front of the school which said that they offered classes for adults. I came in to see if I could join, but the classes were closed  already. That night I took the kids to the movies, and on the way back, I told them we would take a new route. I ended up getting lost. That's the way I found Chaffey College. The following Monday, I went to ask for information. They told me that summer school was starting that week.\nThat's how I started studying English last summer. It is difficult, but I have had great rewards. My daughter had to write a story for school. It was about the female they most admired and why . She wrote that I was the person she most admired because I had started going to College. I will never forget this.",
