  "article": "Many immigrants  to the United States find the decision to seek better lives for their families in America can have an unexpected and tragic consequence . Deep differences with their children develop over language and culture.\n\"Many immigrants arrive here without much education. Their kids soon gain language skills and also street marts  on how to live in America, leaving the parents at a disadvantage,\" Ileana , Roses, pastor of a Methodist church group operating in Virginia, said.\n\"Not only that but they find they cannot relate to children who quickly absorb American culture,\" she said.\nAccording to the US Census Bureau , the number of foreign born or first generation Americans reached 55 million last year, a record one in five of the total population.\nA government survey of 922 immigrants in 2000 found that nearly 40 percent of those who had been in the United States for more than 15 years would still like to take English classes if they had the time.\nTwo thirds of low income households depended on their children for translation.\nPsychologists  and sociologists say parents can lose their position of authority  in a family as a result and the effects of that can be far-reaching.\nChildren exposed to American pop culture that glorifies  youth and sexuality  often rebel when their parents try to impose the conservative values they brought with them.\n\"Americanization erodes  all important aspects of parenting,\" said Richard Weissbourd, who teaches education at Harvard University.\n\"I feel a part of me is dying with my children. They don't listen to my music. I have to play it on Sunday morning when they are not around,\" said an immigrant.",
