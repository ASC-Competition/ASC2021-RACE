  "article": "We like to consider ourselves the superior race, and we are. It's true that we are getting to know more and more, and we actually live in \"the information age\". Our human vanity  makes us believe that we really have to know everything! Surprisingly, we do not have this ability. The question \"what is happening in the Bermuda Triangle\" is the very proof.\nWhere is the Bermuda Triangle located? The mysterious triangle is believed to be situated between Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where too many unusual events have happened.\nOn December the 5th1945, five U.S. military planes took off from Florida on a clear day only to disappear over Bermuda. Furthermore, some other disappearances took place; in 1947, an American C54 plane simply disappeared at 100 miles from Bermuda; at 80 miles, a Star Tiger plane disappeared in 1948.\nEven Columbus had trouble in Bermuda. Some of his journals were about the strange happenings there: \"the waters are changing their colors\" and \"compasses are going wild\".\nMaybe it's why it is called the Devil's triangle or the Atlantic cemetery.\nMany _ were stated in order to explain the strange events. In spite of these attempts, the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle remains unsolved.\nSome people get to say that maybe aliens are involved in it. Other imaginative scientists relate the happenings in Bermuda to Einstein's theory, saying that the missing ships and planes are translated to another dimension of space and time and taken into another world.\nMaybe we will just have to wait to go to Heaven and ask the One who made it. The answer will surely be a satisfying one!",
