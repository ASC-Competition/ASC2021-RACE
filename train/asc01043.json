  "article": "One day a mime is visiting the zoo and attempts to earn some money as a street performer. As soon as he starts to draw a crowd,a zookeeper drags him into his office.The zookeeper explains that the zoo's most popular attraction,a gorilla ,has died suddenly and the keeper fears that attendance  at the zoo will fall off.He offers the mime a job to dress up as the gorilla. The mime accepts.\nThe next morning the mime puts on the gorilla suit and enters the cage before the crowd comes.He soon discovers he can sleep all he wants,play and make fun of people and he draws bigger crowds than he ever did as a mime--the job he likes but loses.\nHowever, with days going by,he begins to notice that the people are paying more attention to the lion in the cage next to his.Not wanting to lose the attention of his audience, he climbs to the top of his cage,crawls across a partition ,and dangles from the top to the lion's cage. The lion gets angry at this. The scene is _ to the crowd.\nAt the end of the day he is given a raise for being such a good attraction--Well,this continues for some time.The crowds grow larger,and the mime's pay keeps going up.\nThen one day when he is dangling over the lion he slips and falls.The mime is terrified. He starts screaming,  \"Help me!\",but the lion is quick.The mime soon finds himself flat on his back looking up at the angry lion and the lion says, \"Shut\nup you fool! Do you want to get us both fired?\"",
