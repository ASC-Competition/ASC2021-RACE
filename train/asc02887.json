  "article": "There is no doubt that teens today are extremely busy. Homework piles up and extra-curricular   activities are time-consuming. Often, teens have to take part in a sport or activity after school, and they are up until 10:00 or later doing homework. Getting teenagers involved in volunteer opportunities can give them a sense of accomplishment that is not connected with sports or school.\nTeenagers are often in their own little world. Helping them get involved in volunteering opportunities is the perfect way for them to open up that world and give their time to a good cause.\nThe key to getting teens involved in volunteer work is to find an opportunity that will fit into their schedule and find something that interests them. Also, keep it close to home. If they have to travel a long distance to volunteer, it's less likely to be accomplished.\nMy son has helped with the local library's reading program for two summers. It is close to home and the schedule is very elastic. We go in and choose days that work with his schedule and he volunteers for about 2 hours at a time. He is responsible for helping kids get signed up for the summer reading program and helping them record the hours they read. It is only a one-week time commitment, but it is very rewarding.\nWhen teens volunteer they often see that there are others more needy than themselves. They also learn time management. Your teen will become a more rounded, less self-centred individual.\nColleges see thousands of students applying for admission every year. If your teen has shown the devotion to volunteer in the community, it can give him the advantage for college admission or scholarship opportunities. So, volunteering is good for their present and their future!",
