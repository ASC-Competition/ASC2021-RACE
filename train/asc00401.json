For three years he learned from him.Then one\nday, when he thought he had learned everything,the thought arose in him:\"If I kill this\nold man,then 1 will be the greatest archer.\"\nThe old man had gone to cut wood and he was coming back carrying wood On his\nshoulder.The young man hid behind a tree,waiting to kill him.He shot an arrow.The\nold man took a small piece of wood and threw it.It struck the arrow and the arrow\nturned back and wounded the young man very deeply.The old man came,took Out the\narrow and said. \"I knew that some day or other you were going to do this.That's  why\nI have not taught you this secret.There is no need to kill me.My Master is still alive,\nand I'm nothing before him.You must be with him for at least thirty years.And he is\nvery old, so go fast! Find the old man!\"",
