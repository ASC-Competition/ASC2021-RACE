  "article": "One day, a train was approaching the small town of Cheekyville. On the train was a young man with a big suitcase. He was called William Warbler, and he looked very common indeed. What made him most unusual, though, was the fact that whenever he needed to communicate he did it by singing opera  . It didn't matter to William whether it was simply a matter of answering a brief greeting, like \"good day\". He would clear his voice and respond, \"Gooood dayyy to youuuuuuuu... toooooo!\"\nNo one could get a normal spoken word out of him and no one knew how he made his living. As he lived quite simply, always wearing his same old second-hand suit, people often looked down on him.\nWilliam had been in Cheekyville for some years, when, one day, word spread round town like wildfire: William had played a role in a very important opera in the nation's capital. Everyone in the capital went to see it, and it was a great success. Everyone in Cheekyville felt it was a surprise. But something more surprising was, when William was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great manners, and with a clear and pleasant voice.\nFrom that day, William gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn't have thought so if they had seen what William kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved   message on it. The message said: \"Practice, my boy. Practice every second, for you never know when your chance will come.\"\nLittle did people realize that he only got the role in the opera because the director had heard William singing while out buying a newspaper.",
