  "article": "You may have heard of the famous saying, \"East or west, home is the best.\"\nWhat does the word \"home\" mean to you? How do you say the word in French? In Chinese? In your language? Although people usually know what the word means, it sometimes has no exact translation. It's not surprising, because the idea of home is \" different from country to country and from person to person\". A home is more than a roof and four walls. It's the cooking ,eating, talking, playing and sleeping that go on inside. And at home you usually feel safe and relaxed.\nHomes look different in different countries. They also have different things inside. For example, in cold northern Europe, there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it, In the south, where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out, there are small windows and cool stone floors.\nWe asked some people about their homes.\nHow often do people move house in your country?\n\" In my country many people don't stay in one place for a very long time. They often move every ten years or so.\"\n------Cheryl, Boston, USA\nWhat are the features of homes in your country?\n\" In Britain, even in town, there's always a garden. We have separate bedrooms and living rooms. But we don't often have balconies. The weather isn't warm enough!\"\n------Pat, Exeter, England",
