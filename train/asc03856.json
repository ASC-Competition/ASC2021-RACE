  "article": "Tu Youyou, an 84-year-old female scientist, became the first Chinese to win a Nobel Prize in science on Oct 5. Before that, she ever won the 2011 Lasker Award for finding out artemisinin (Qinghaosu), which saved millions of lives. She was grateful for the Lasker prize, but said, \"It is just a scientist' duty. I will go on fighting for the health of all humans.\"\nTu kept her work in the 1960s and 1970s. In that age, Malaria   could took away people's health. Scientists all over the world had already tried over 240, 000 times but failed. Tu Youyou, a member of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, began to study Chinese herbs.\nBefore 2011, people didn't know Tu very much. Many friends played jokes with her \"the Professor of Three None's\" : no degree , no study experience abroad, not a member of any Chinese national colleges. But she is hard-working. She read a lot of traditional Chinese medicine books and did a lot of researches on the disease.\nIn February, 2012, Tu was named National Outstanding Females (One of the Ten) Tu is now a model of Chinese medical workers.",
