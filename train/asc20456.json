  "article": "I work in a small shop. It is near a factory. Every day, workers, old ladies and housewives come to the shop to buy things.\nI live in a house not very far from the shop. I usually get up at six, have breakfast and then go to work by bike. I take some food along in my lunch box.\nI get to the shop at about ten to seven. At seven customers  begin to arrive. They buy meat, eggs, sugar, soybean, sauce, cooking oil  , salt, candies, biscuits and many other things. We don't sell  vegetables or fruit. There is a shop for these things nearby. I have my meal at noon from my lunch box. At seven in the evening we close the shop. I tidy things up and then go home for supper.\nSome people may think my work isn't so interesting. But I do my bit for the modernizations , don't I?",
