  "article": "\"Made in China\" has Changed\nMany shoppers in the West still prize labels, boasting   a product was made in Italy without knowing that a growing number of Italian products come from factories that are Chineseowned and staffed. The products which were marked \"Made in China\" gave the buyer an impression of \"low pride and low cost, low technology and development\". The statement used to be true, but now it has changed.\n\"Made in China\" is becoming a leading part in the world market. China's garment industry   has been investing in producing technology and training for decades, and its workforce has collectively gotten better at sewing garments. As a result, the quality of Chinesemade clothes is rising fast. It has been home to a highlyskilled, highlyspecialized garment industry, one that supplies even some highend   labels and offers the best mix of price, speed, and quality.\n\"If I was to make a basic men's jean, I'd make that in Pakistan,\" said Edward Hertzman, coowner of the trade publication Sourcing Journal. \"If I was going to make a fashionable women's garment, I would move to China because their skill set is better, their hand is better, their finishing is better, and they can handle that type of fashion.\"\nIndeed, luxury fashion labels now routinely make things in China. Burberry, Armani, and Prada have all produced things there, because they're still able to get good workmanship at a relatively low price. Even the Japanese brand Visvim, known for its crazy attention to detail, also produces highend, handmade footwear in China.\nDespite the rising wages and costs of doing business in China, companies have not walked away. \"China is viewed by people who make buying decisions as unique and hard to copy elsewhere,\" says Josh Green, CEO of Panjiva.",
