  "article": "Recently a professor of philosophy in the United States has written a book called Money and the Meaning of Life. He has discovered that how we deal with money in our day to day life has more meaning than we usually think. One of the exercises he has asked his students to do is to keep a record of every penny they spend for a week. From the way they spend their money, they can see what they really value in life.\nThe professor says our relation with others often becomes clearly defined when money enters the picture. You might have wonderful friendship with somebody and you think that you are very good friends. But you will know him only when you ask him to lend you some money.If he does,it brings something to the relationship that seems stronger than ever before. Otherwise it can suddenly weaken the relationship if he doesn't. Since money is so important to us, we consider those who are rich to be very important. The professor interviews some rich people in his research for his book.\nQuestion:  What is the most surprising thing you have discovered about being rich?\nAnswer :  The most surprising thing is why people give me so much respect . I am nothing.I don't know much.All I am is rich.\nPeople just have an idea of making more and more money, but what is it for? How much money do I need for any given purpose in my life? In his book,the professor uncovered an important need in modern society:to bring back the idea that money is a tool rather than the end.Money plays an important role in the material world,but expecting money to give happiness may be missing the meaning of life.",
