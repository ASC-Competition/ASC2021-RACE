  "article": "The children in the village wear dirty, cheap clothes. They sleep beside cows and sheep in small houses. They have no school. But they can write 26 English letters, and some know a few English words.\nHow did it happen? It was because a U.S. group called One Computer Every Child offered them 20 computers.\nCan children teach themselves to read when they have no schools or teachers but have the help of today's new technology ? The goal  of the group is to find out the answer. And the results are exciting.\n\"The children are learning more than they would in one year of school,\" said Matt Keller, who organized the programme.\nThe fastest learner was an eight-year-old boy called Kelbesa Negusse. He said that he himself was like a lion.\nKeller said, \"Seven months ago he didn't know any English. But now he has known many words. I think if you give them food and water they will never leave the computer room. They will spend day and night there.\"\nKelbesa said, \"I like the computer because I can learn things with it.\" He added, \"I know many English words, like dog, monkey, horse, sheep, cow, pig and cat.\"\nKeller said that One Computer Every Child was planning a programme for children who couldn't go to school.",
