  "article": "Two girls living next door to each other-a seemingly plain scene that has two very different life .stories behind it.\nChi Zhen, an 18-year-old student in Seville, Spain, used his camera to tell the story of two lives, which went widespread online. Comments on the photos indicate that they have inspired many, to believe that the future is in their own hands.\nChi has seen many youths living life without a goal, wasting their time and blaming bad luck for it.\nFeeling regret for them, he took a series of photos of his friends Veronica and Anna Maria, both freshmen at the University of Seville in Spain. They live completely different life styles and are getting opposite results.\nChi hopes the photos will inspire those who have let go of their own fate  .\nIn the photos, Anna Maria, a Spanish girl, can be seen watching a TV programme . She spends most of her time in front of her laptop. She rarely goes out, because she thinks she's not attractive and doesn't know what to say in social situations. \"'I'm not as lucky as Veronica,\" she often says.\nBut she doesn't know that while she's wasting time watching TV, -Veronica, the \"lucky\" girl next door,has taught herself four foreign languages and traveled to many places. She goes to the library frequently  and her extensive knowledge and experience allow her to take part in any conversation and become the center of attention.\nChi thinks that Anna Maria resembles many of his Chinese .friends who study abroad. They are trapped to their little circles, never trying to change their fate./'They say 'maybe I'll do it in my next life', but they are in their 20s, their best time. How can they give up hope and accept this as their life?\" Chi says.\nThe influence of the photos has gone far beyond what Chi expected. One user commented on his photos on Renren.com, saying, \"A wall separates two worlds, and the life we have depends on what we do.\" Another is determined to make a change right away. \"I'm turning off my laptop and not watching TV anymore,\" he wrote.",
