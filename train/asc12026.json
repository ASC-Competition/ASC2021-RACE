  "article": "Our Web Editor Jan Fields has always loved two things----writing and teaching, so she's done both throughout her professional career. After graduating from college with a BA in Journalism, she quickly found that writing for newspapers didn't fulfill her dream. So she switched to magazines and soon began teaching magazine writing. Still, something didn't feel quite right. She wanted more challenges and creativity.\nIn the 1980s, Jan answered a call to rewrite a year's children's church lesson. She quickly found That writing stories and activities for children offered all she desired. She dove in and has never looked back. Her work has appeared in Ladybug, Shining Star and many others. \nAs Jan continued building credits in children's magazines, educational magazines, and parenting Magazines, she looked for opportunities to pass along what she had learned to other writers. Soon, teaching small community college classes wasn't enough---she wanted to help other writers to find success in creating material for children. \nIn 2001, she discovered the Institute of Children's Literature and she's been happily instructing students here ever since. To best meet her students' needs, she's constantly searching out new information. As a web editor, Jan looks after the needs of all the visitors to this site. She moderates the Scheduled Events discussion groups and the Writer's Retreat forum, writes for the Writer's Support Room, and edits the Writer's Support Room and Writing Tips articles. \nJan is always open to suggestions for new ways to meet the needs of the writing community. Feel free to email her. She's eager to hear from you.",
