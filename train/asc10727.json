  "article": "The invention of the electric telegraph gave birth to the communications industry.Although Samuel B.Morse succeeded in making the invention useful in 1837,it was not until 1843 that the first important telegraph line was constructed.By 1860 more than 50,000 miles of lines connected people east of the Rockies.The following year,San Francisco was added to the network.\nThe national telegraph network strengthened the ties between East and West and contributed to the rapid expansion of the railroads by providing an efficient means to monitor schedules and routes.Furthermore,the extension of the telegraph,combined with the invention of the steam-driven rotary printing press by Richard\nM.Hoe in 1846,revolutionized the world of journalism.Where the business of news gathering had been dependent upon the mail and on hand-operated presses,the telegraph expanded the amount of information a newspaper could supply and allowed for more timely reporting.The creating of the Associated Press as a central wire service in 1846 marked the arrival of a new era   in journalism.",
