  "article": "In the gym of Croxteth Community School, Liverpool, 50 boys have completed a course on boxing that is seen as a pilot for its return to state schools.\nThe Schools Amateur Boxing Association (SABA) has developed the Kid Gloves scheme ( ),a -non-contact  version of the sport where outside coaches teach a range of basic skills.\nChris Andrews, assistant secretary of the SABA, said the scheme was regarded as a way of changing the decline in boxing in state schools which began 25 years ago.\nSafety fears and the poor image of professional boxing had accelerated the sport's decline. Concern was worsened by incidents such as the death of the professional boxer Bradley Stone. But the Croxteth example was winning more supporters. Mr. Andrews said the idea was particularly well received in the north-east of England.\n\"The interest shown so far has been enormous,\" he said. \"I believe that boxing will come back into schools. A video has been produced to promote boxing in schools, and a bid has been made for a Sports Council grant  .\"\nHe said, \"I think there is a genuine recognition that there are aspects to boxing, if it is controlled and properly run, that really are very beneficial for children. This scheme takes away the dangers. I hope boxing can be promoted throughout the country in a more coordinated way.\" Such an idea horrifies such groups as the British Medical Association (BMA) and the British Safety Council, both critics of the idea.\nDr Jeffrey Cundy, the joint author of a BMA report on boxing, accepted that the scheme in Liverpool was non-contact, but he was still opposed. He said, \"We feel that children should still not be introduced to boxing, because they will then be encouraged to take up an activity which is uniquely dangerous when actual contact takes place.\"\nHe added, \"There is a whole range of sports which will teach the discipline that comes from boxing without the dangers. We see this reintroduction in schools as an unhealthy development.\"\nAt the 800-pupil Croxteth school, Steve Stewart, head of PE, said boxing had helped to improve self-confidence, self-discipline, self-awareness and self-respect in those taking part. Everybody could get involved and, because all were starting from scratch, the improvements could be quickly seen.\nCertificates were presented to the pupils at the end of the course by Paul Hodgkinson, a local boxer who is a former world champion. Next year, the course will be repeated and if possible girls will be allowed to take part following requests from them.\nGerry Thompson and Tony Curry, both 12,have enjoyed the boxing sessions and say they will both join a local boxing club. \"I thought it was brilliant,\" said Gerry. \"I would rather be a professional boxer than a footballer. It's more enjoyable*\"",
