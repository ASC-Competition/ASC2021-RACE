  "article": "Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement.\nBecause they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire.\nOne reason why children keep changing their answers to \"what would you like to be when you grow up\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field.\nChildren view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook.\nAccording to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them.\nOf course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children. So it is no wonder why children who have parents as their role models have fewer behavioral issues.",
