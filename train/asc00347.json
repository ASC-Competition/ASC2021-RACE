  "article": "This time, it is to be worn on wrists. Having already changed the way we communicate with its smartphones, Apple Inc released its next big thing on March 9 in San Francisco, US.\nThe Apple Watch, according to CNN, is \"a simple rectangular   shape with a range of stylish and useful wristbands.\" \"The style is classic... in those respects   it's up there with the top quality Swiss watches,\" commented the news outlet.\nThe watch will be available in nine places, including the US, the UK and China, from April 24. The starting price is $349 (2,186 yuan).\nWith six different designs and 30 or so wristbands, the gadget \"sets the standard for smartwatches, in style,\" agreed The Brisbane Times,\"but more importantly, in functionality  .\" \"With the built-in speaker and microphone, you can receive calls on your watch. I have been wanting to do this since I was 5 years old,\" said Apple's chief executive Tim Cook.\nIn fact, anything you can do on the iPhone is there on the watch - e-mails, text messages, airline boarding services, and directions from Apple Maps. Using a home security app, you can keep an eye on your home from afar, or even open a locked door.\nThere are some features that have made Cook sure the watch is \"our most personal device yet; a new chapter in the way we relate to technology\". According to NPR, the watch taps you on the wrist to draw your attention to a message or a calendar reminder, and it can send a tap on the wrist to another Apple Watch wearer.\nHowever, the watch can also do things that are just plain fun. You can send a real-time display of your heartbeat to another Apple Watch to \"let someone know you are thinking about them.\"\nPatrick Moorhead, a leading technology analyst in the US, described the tech company as \"a master in the art of persuasion\". \"The secret weapon is the ability to message each other by tapping on the watch,\" he told The Associated Press. \"I think people, particularly kids, are going to go nuts   over that.\"\nSo far, though, the most impressive part of this new device is \"the monitoring of the wearer's health and fitness,\" said AFP. It will even tap you on the wrist if you have been sitting down for longer than is good for your health.",
