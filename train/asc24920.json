  "article": "It's a long-awaited day for China. The navy now has its first aircraft carrier , Liaoning. It's a unique experience to get to know the life in the carrier. The carrier is just like a small city on the sea. It has all the functions for daily life. There are 4 words to sum up its characters: big, small, much and high. The carrier Liaoning is such a huge one that the total length of the whole corridor could reach over 20 kilometers. But the living space for the sailors is quite small. That's because the carrier is designed for researching purposes, rather than comfortable living. Over 1,000 sailors, both men and women, are living onboard. They are arranged among over 3,000 tiny rooms below the deck.. For visitors, it's so easy to get lost. So the first thing the new sailors have to learn is their way around. The number of female sailors is much less than that of the males, taking about 5 percent of the total. But they play a key role in carrying out some special missions.\nAlso, you will be surprised by the high level of education of today's sailors. The captain said that over 90 percent of the sailors are college graduates. Six hold Doctor's Degrees and 45 have a Master's. The whole team is young but vigorous. The complex work on the carrier requires high management abilities for the commanders onboard .",
