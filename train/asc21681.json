  "article": "\"Today is Mom's birthday, Mosh,\" Nick said. \"Let's make her favorite banana bread and surprise her.\"Nick took out a cookbook. \"I'll read the recipe, and you follow it. Get out a bowl and a spoon while I turn on the oven.\" Nick read from the cookbook. \"First, mash   the bananas in the bowl.\"\nThe robot put the bananas into the bowl and was going to mash them with its hands. \"Stop!\" Nick said. \"Let's try this again. Peel the bananas, put them in the bowl, and mash them with the spoon.\" Nick watched when Mosh peeled the bananas and put the peel   into the bowl. Again, Nick told Mosh to stop. Then he showed the robot which part of each banana should go into the bowl.\nThen Nick read, \"Add the eggs. No, wait,\" he said right away. Nick cracked   the eggs into the bananas.\n\"Last, add flour  , milk and sugar,\" Nick said. \"Mix everything together. Then pour the batter   into the bread pan.\" Mosh followed Nick's orders while Nick read the cookbook.\n\"I'll put this in the oven,\" Nick picked up the pan.\nJust then Kelly came into the room. \"What happened in here?\" she felt surprised.\nNick answered, \"Mosh and I are making banana bread for Mom's birthday. It is a lot of work, but I think she will be surprised.\"\n\"If you want it to be a good surprise for Mom,\" Kelly laughed, \"you need to give Mosh one more order. Clean up!\"",
