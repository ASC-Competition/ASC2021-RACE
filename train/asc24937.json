  "article": "Dear editor( ),\nCan't your newspaper do something about the custom   of hitchhiking?\nA short time ago, on a car travel I counted at least 50 people standing beside the road, asking for rides. Many of them were young women.\nDon't they understand how dangerous it is to get into the car driven by a stranger? How much do they know about the driver? Is he a good driver or not? They know nothing!\nMany of these young hitchhikers may come from good families. Don't their parents teach them anything about the world? I always taught my children not to talk to strangers. I never let them take rides from people they didn't know.\nIsn't there enough crime   today without asking for trouble by hitchhiking? On the other hand, hitchhiking may bring some traffic trouble. Don't you think what I said is true?\nA Worried Grandfather",
