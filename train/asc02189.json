  "article": "My wife and I have always been friendly with the clerks at the local store. I don't think many people appreciate what a difficult job these clerks have. They work for a little money and I often wonder how they make ends meet.\nOne of the clerks, Charlie, was always wearing his glasses but he didn't one day. I asked him about it and he said they'd been out of order and that he couldn't afford a new pair. His family needed money. It was clear that he was having a difficult time.\nWe wanted to help him, so we turned to our own eye doctor for help with a plan. We had his secretary contact him, asking him to come in for an eye exam for free. We told the doctor to let him order whatever glasses he wanted and that we would pay for them. Although Charlie questioned what was going on, the doctor just told him that someone had offered the money for his new glasses. When we went in to pay the bill, the doctor told us he was touched by our idea so that he _ the exam fee and only charged us for half the price of the glasses!\nIt was so wonderful to see Charlie in his new glasses and he enjoyed telling all the regular customers how the gift came about. I'm sure that upon hearing his story, ideas of kindness may have come in the minds of many people.",
