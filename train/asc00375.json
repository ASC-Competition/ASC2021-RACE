  "article": "Below is a housing guide for students going to London.\nUniversity accommodation  offices\nMany university accommodation offices have their own list of registered landlords  . Others also provide information on accommodation agencies and other housing organizations. The advantage of using your university accommodation office is that you can get some support if you have a problem. The disadvantage is that they are unlikely to have enough registered landlords to houses all their students.\nProperty papers: Loot and Renting\nLoot is an important source   of information about private housing for co-renters. The offers are from private landlords, agencies and individuals looking for other co-renters. They also have a website: www.loot.com. The advantage of using Loot is that there are some excellent bargains. The disadvantage is that there is no quality control over the offers.\nRenting is another useful paper. The offers in this paper are mainly from accommodation agencies. Their website is at www.renting.co.uk.\nAccommodation agencies\nThe majority of rented accommodation in London is probably advertised through accommodation agencies. The advantage of using accommodation agencies is that: you will have access to a large number of accommodations. A good agent will listen to your requirements and can save you time in looking for the right accommodation. The disadvantage is that they will make a range of charges to potential renters.\nNoticeboards\nAround the universities you will find a number of noticeboards where offers of accommodation will be posted. These will either be from landlords or from students. Some universities will also have online noticeboards where students can advertise to other students. Advertisements from students can be an excellent way to find accommodation. However, advertisements from landlords can be problematic.\nWord of mouth\nSome of the best housing in London is never advertised but is passed on from one group of students to another by word of mouth. It might be that you can find out about good offers from final year students. However, don't suppose that just because you have found out about housing from a friend it is necessarily going to be better than that found through any other source.\nFamily\nFaced with the very high rents charged in London, some students and their parents will consider buying as an alternative. In some cases this might be a good choice.",
