  "article": "My grandfather took me to the fishing pond on the farm when I was about 7 years old, and he asked me to throw a stone into the water.\nI did what I was asked. Then my grandfather told me to watch the waves made by the stone. Moments later, he asked me to think of myself as that stone.\n\"You may make a lot of splashes in your life, but remember the waves that come from those splashes will affect the peace of all your friends beside you,\" he said.\n\"Remember that you are responsible for  what you throw into your circle, and that your waves will touch many other circles. Always try to live in a way that the waves that come from your circle send out the peace of your goodness to other circles.\"\n\"Remember the waves that come from anger and jealousy will also send those feelings to other circles. You are responsible for all the waves.\"\nThat was the first time I realized each person creates the inner peace or anger that flows out into the world. We cannot create world peace if we have hatred and anger.\nWe _ the feelings and thoughts that we hold inside, whether we tell others about them or not. Whatever is inside of us is flowing out into the world and touching all the other circles of life.\n,.",
