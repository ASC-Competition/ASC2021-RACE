  "article": "A British shopper, Emma Mumford, who was named \"the Coupon  Queen\" has spent just PS350 on a luxury  Christmas for her and her family--but got PS2,500 worth of food, drink and presents thanks to coupons and offers.\nMs Mumford is a so-called \"extreme couponer\" and spends hours hunting out the best deals and bargains. She has been preparing for this Christmas since the end of the last one. Ms Mumford made the huge savings by checking price comparison websites and as a result collected more presents than she needed for Christmas. After sorting out gifts for all of her family, she has even been able to donate PS1,000 worth of presents to her local hospital.\n\"It has been so nice to have Christmas sorted and not having to worry about _ . I wanted to get high quality presents for my family and show that you can do it without spending a fortune. There is a misconception that everyone who does couponing only gets value products but through my careful shopping I have managed to purchase designer perfumes , a high-end coffee machine.\" she explained.\nShe said \"What started as a hobby to help me save money has turned into my life and I am able to run a business helping people save money. I know what it feels like to struggle as my ex-partner had a lot of debt which I took on for him. We were in a poor situation where every penny counted. That's what really inspired me.\"\nShe has now turned her bargain-hunting addiction into a business where she searches for the best deals and offers tips to the general public through video blogging and her Facebook Page.\n\"I try and show people that it is just a little bit of work in the beginning but it will eventually pay off. One of the best things to do is just to be a bit forward thinking and save throughout the year.\"",
