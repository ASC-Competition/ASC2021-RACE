  "article": "There are many kinds of cars in this world. My grandfather thinks this is because cars are like their drivers. He says, \"Rich people have expensive cars, big people have large cars, and old people drive old cars.\" But I don't agree with him.\nMy neighbor, Mrs. Hill, is 82 years old. She drives only on Tuesday, and then she drives only to the bank. She never drives more than 30 kilometers an hour. Do you think Mrs. Hill has a very old and small car? No! Her car is new. It's very large, and it can go 200 kilometers an hour!\nMy friend Mike is an artist. He paints beautiful pictures with lots of colors. But his car is black. Mrs. Bates has a very, very old car. It often has some trouble. Does she drive that kind of car because she is poor? No, she has four restaurants and two million dollars in the bank. My uncle Joe has a very small car. Every Sunday, he drives to the country with his wife, his three children, his mother and his dog.\nNow, you have read about my friends and their cars. Do you agree with my grandfather? Maybe you have a car. Does it say something about you?",
