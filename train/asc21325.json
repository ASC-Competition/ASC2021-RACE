  "article": "Justin Bieber's birthday wish has come true. The teenage star announced earlier this week that he wanted his fans to donate $17,000 to charity---so far the total of gifts that have poured in is more than $31000.\n\"I have had a great year and it is all because of the fans helping me live my dream,\" said the young singer. \"I'm turning 17 years old on Tuesday, and have so much to be grateful  for! So this year, I really want my birthday to be all about helping others. Instead of asking for gifts, I'm asking friends, family and fans to consider donating $17 for my 17thbirthday to help make a change.\"\nBieber asked his fans to donate to a charity that builds clean water projects in developing countries.\n\"Together, we've made a big difference for many causes. Did you know that about 4,500 kids die each day from waterborne diseases  ? By building clean water projects for villages that need them, we can prevent this! I want to make my birthday matter this year--- let's make it so more kids can grow up to have a 17thbirthday like me. Join me to make a change.\n\"I'm really so grateful for my family, friends and fans--- and I believe we can do something big to help bring clean water to people in need. Even if you don't have $17 to give I just ask you to go out in your community and try and make a positive difference. Even the smallest act of kindness can go a long way.\"\n,.",
