  "article": "Not only women wear skirts. Men can wear them, too. In Scotland  , men wear a kilt - a kind of skirt. The kilt is their national dress.\nThe kilt has checks   and different colors, like red or blue. Each family in Scotland has its own colors. How did the Scotsmen   start to wear kilts. There is a story about it. Rawlinson had some workers from Scotland in his office and he thought their clothing _ their work. So he cut their clothes into a shorter skirt.\nToday, they usually only wear them at weddings   or big dinners. Only a few men wear a kilt every day. Scotsmen also wear kilts in big parties. The policemen still have skills as the dress uniforms, but they don't wear them to catch the thieves.",
