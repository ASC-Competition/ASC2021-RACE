  "article": "Hello! I am Oliver Smith. I am from UK. I can speak English well but my Chinese is not good. I like doing sports after school. My favorite sports are running, basketball and swimming. I like to be a sports star when I grow up. I have good eating habits. I don't eat ice-cream, hamburgers or cola because I know they are not healthy. I also don't like to be fat, so I like eating vegetables and fruit.\nI have a good friend. His name is Chen Lin. He is not good at sports, but he's good at art. He sings well and draws well. He drew a nice picture for me on my birthday. I was excited. We sometimes play games together after school. We always have much fun. If you like us, join us! We can be friends and have a great time together!",
