  "article": "Anyone who has ever traveled with a teenager knows that the teenager can make the vacation good or bad for the entire family. As a travel agent, Lynda Maxwell said, \"If teenagers are happy, everybody is happy.\"\nTeenagers are often interested in travelling, but their interests and schedules often aren't the same as their parents'. It means that when the parents start to look for a place of interest in the early morning, their teenagers may be sleeping soundly!\nThe thing makes travelling with teenagers very difficult, but it isn't impossible. The experts said, \"The keys to success is what parents do before they travel.\"\nFor many families, the hardest part may be finding a vacation time that is right for everyone. Be sure to sit down with everyone else in the family before setting a date.\n\"After setting a date, ask teenagers where they would choose to go,\" suggested Maxwell. It is possible that they'd like nothing more than to sit on a beach for a week. \"Maybe there's a compromise ,\" said Maxwell.\n\"Most teenagers like using the Internet now, so parents can ask them to think up the ideas about what to see and do,\" said Brad Anderson. \"I find teenagers are excellent at making great suggestions.\"",
