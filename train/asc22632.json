  "article": "Tom grows the nicest vegetables and fruits, and the most beautiful flowers in his village. Plants grow in Tom's garden all through the year.Tom cuts some flowers for his sitting-room table and eats some fruits and vegetables, but he sells most of them in the market. His vegetables, fruits and flowers are so wonderful that they sell much more quickly in the market than those of other villages.\nHow does Tom grow these beautiful plants? He is so lazy that he just sits under his orange tree with his radio. He listens to music all day.\nThat is quite true. Tom plants things in spring, summer, autumn and winter. After that he sits with his radio. And everything grows. It is the music that does work. Tom knows more clearly that music  makes the biggest vegetables and fruits and the most beautiful flowers. Plants love music as much as people.",
