  "article": "Recently, the TV show Where Are We Going, Dad? has become one of China's most popular TV shows, attracting more than 600 million viewers each week.\nIn this program, five celebrity fathers traveled to six countryside locations across China, including some villages in Beijing, Yunnan, Shandong, Hunan, Heilongjiang and a desert in Ningxia. They took care of their kids without the help of the kid's mothers. At the same time, they also took part in different kinds of activities with their kids together, such as cooking, fishing and selling goods.\nWhy is the show so popular? \"It reflects   social reality. In big cities, fathers are always busy earning money and making achievements in their career. They don't spare more time with their kids.\" said Xie Dikui, general director of the show. As the father of a 3-year-old daughter, Xie said that he found his own heart being touched as he made it. \"Although these fathers are busy, they are able to spare time for their kids. We can do better than them.\"\n _ also happens in some rural areas in China. More and more men from rural areas are now working in big cities, leaving their kids at home under the Grandparents' care.\n\"I have a son and a daughter in my hometown.\" said Xu Canyong, a 33-year-old man working in Shantou, Guangdong Province. \"They come to live with me only during summer and winter vacations. I miss them very much. I want to have them live with us in Shantou, but the cost of living here is too high.\" said Xu.",
