  "article": "A new research has uncovered that culture is a determining factor when people interpret facial emotions  .The study reveals that in cultures where emotional control is the standard,such as Japan,the focus is placed on the eyes to interpret emotions. Whereas in cultures where emotion is openly expressed,such as the United States,the focus is on the mouth to interpret emotions.\n\"These findings go against the popular theory that the facial expressions of basic emotions can be universally recognized,\" said University of Alberta researcher Dr.Takahiko Masuda.\" A person's culture plays a very strong role in determining how he will read emotions and needs to be considered when interpreting the facial expressions.\"\nThese cultural differences are even noticeable in computer emoticons ,which are used to convey a writer's emotions by email and text message. The Japanese emotions for happiness and sadness vary in terms of how the eyes are drawn ,while the American emotions vary with the direction of the mouth. In the United States the emoticons:)and:) show a happy face,whereas the emoticons:(and:(show a sad face. However,the Japanese tend to use the symbol ('') to indicate a happy face,and (;;) to indicate a sad face.\n\"We think it is quite interesting and appropriate that culture tends to mask its emotions. The Japanese would focus on a person's eyes when detecting his or her emotions,as eyes tend to be quite subtle ,\"said Masuda. \"In the United States,where an open emotion is quite common,it makes sense to focus on the mouth,which is the most expressive feature on a person's face.\"",
