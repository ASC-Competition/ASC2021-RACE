  "article": "Molly was a peasant girl. Her parents did not have much money and Molly did not have many nice clothes.\nOne day Molly's father said to her, \"Molly, take this pot of milk to market and sell it. You may keep the money.\"\nMolly was very happy. She put the pot of milk on her head and started her journey to market. While she was walking alone she began to think. \"I will get quite a lot of money for this milk,\" she thought. \"What will I do with the money? I will buy a lot of eggs. I will take the eggs home with me. One of our hens will sit on them. Then there will be lots of little chickens. I will not sell the chickens. They will grow into hens. Then there will be more eggs. And these eggs will give me still more chickens. Soon I will have hundreds of hens. Then I will sell them all. They will bring me a lot of money. I will be rich. I will buy lots of new clothes. I will always wear nice clothes. Then a rich man will marry me. We will have a beautiful house, a big car and nice children...\"\nMolly was very happy. She jumped into the air. The pot of milk fell from her head onto the road. And that was the end of all her dreams.\nIn English there is a proverb. It says: Do not count your chickens before they are hatched .",
