  "article": "NO.4 Middle School\nKunming, Yunnan\nApril 2nd, 2004\nDear editor \nI live in a beautiful city. Many visitors come to my city. There are so many colorful peacocks here .The peacocks mostly live on the grass land of Dongfeng Square \nThey are given food freely by visitors ,They usually throw food to them ,and  don't think about at all whether the food is right or not. Some of the peacocks became ill, some even died after eating the bad food given by the visitors . I'm sure most of the visitors who throw food to the peacocks really like the birds ,but don't realize that they may be doing them harm  .The visitors should be told that what have done is very harmful to the birds , and this kind of thing must be stopped from happening Perhaps we can build some small shops beside Dongfeng Square to sell peacock food .For us every person, it's our duty to give more love to these beautiful birds and to look after them carefully.\nYours,\nSun Yan",
