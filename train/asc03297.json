  "article": "Those accustomed to looking through thousands of books in big bookstores may find  Japan's Morioka Shoten a little strange.That's because this tiny bookstore that is located in  luxury shopping district of Ginza,in Tokyo offers just one title to its customers.\nOpened in May 2015,Morioka Shoten(Japanese for bookstore)is the brainchild of Yoshiyuki Morioka.The experienced bookseller began his career as a bookstore clerk in Tokyo's Kanda district before branching out to open his own store.It was here while organizing book readings that he realized that customers usually came into the store with one title in mind.Morioka began to wonder if a store could exist by selling many copies of just one single book.In November 2014,he partnered with his two friends,to establish a unique bookstore with the idea'A Single Room,A Single Book.'\nLike its offering,the bookstore is simple.The selections that are picked by Morioka change weekly and vary widely to attract customers with different interests.Recent choices include The True Deceiver,all award-winning Swedish novel by Tove Jansson,Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales.and a collection of artist Karl Blossfeldt's photography of plants.Morioka has also displayed books written by famous Japanese authors Mimei Ogawa and ito Akagi.\nTo highlight his single offering,Morioka often uses clever methods.For example,when selling a book about flowers,he decorated his shop with the ones that had been mentioned in the book.He also encourages featured authors to hold multiple talks and discussions so they can connect with customers.Morioka says his ultimate goal is for the customers to perience being inside a book,not just a bookstore!\nRisky as the idea might seem,things appear to be going well.Morioka says he has sold over 2,100 books since he opened it.Things can only get better given that his bookstore is becoming increasingly popular not just among the locals but also visitors from other countries*",
