  "article": "Every year, millions of Americans see their personal information leak into the wrong hands. Maybe there's spyware on the their computer, or a service they use suffered a security reach, leaving customers at the risk of exposure. Or perhaps their password is easy to guess.\nDon't fear: You can easily set up proper defenses. Here's how.\n* Clean Your Computer and Smartphone\nBefore you put new security measures into place, make sure your devices are as spotless as possible. This means installing a good antivirus program and taking the time to clear out any spy -- or malware that may have already infected your system. These days, it's also worth it to make sure your phone is safe from viruses. Iphones are less likely to be targeted by spyware, but Android users should download the Lookout app to scan their devices and ensure everything is as it should be.\n* Secure Your WiFi.\nIt's fairly easy for potential criminals to gain access to your information if they're able to share your connection -- that's why you want to be careful when using public WiFi. Even though you put security measures into place a couple of years ago, it's a good idea to refresh your settings.\n* Use passwords\nWhat you've heard is true: Passwords should use a variety of special characters, numerals, letters, and cases when possible.\n* Check the shopping security\nTake care when shopping online. Always check the security symbols when using an online site for shopping. If the lock icon encryption    is not there, do not give out credit details. Also, check that the site is legal -- never go to a site from a random email and start shopping online.\nKeep a separate credit card just for online shopping. This will make it easier to cancel if something bad does happen and your other credit card for \"in real life\" can still be used uninfluenced.\nDon't store information on any store's website. It may be convenient but it's also a possible loss to you if the site is hacked.",
