  "article": "Mrs. Amatuli was my teacher in the fourth grade.\nOne day at lunch time, I was getting ready to eat my same old tuna fish sandwich and suddenly Mrs. Amatuli asked me if she could buy my sandwich from me. She explained that I could use the money to buy a hot lunch from the cafeteria.\nI was thrilled. I never bought my lunch at the cafeteria. It was too expensive for my family, and we always carried our lunch and brought the bah back home to use again the next day. My sandwiches were either bologna or tuna fish. It rarely varied beyond that.\nYou can understand my delight when I had the opportunity to buy a hot lunch.\nWhen we finished lunch that day, Mrs. Amatuli took me aside and said she wanted to explain why she had bought my sandwich.\nOh, I couldn't wait to get home and tell my Mama that form now on I wanted tuna fish on Fridays. After my Mama understood why, she gladly fixed tuna fish for me on Friday. She even fixed it on brown bread because she knew Mrs. Amatuli liked brown bread.\nFrom then on every Friday I cold get in line with the rest of the kids for a hot lunch. I didn't care how many of the ids complained about cafeteria food--it tasted _ to me!\nI realize now that Mrs. Amatuli could have fixed herself a tuna sandwich of Friday. But she bought my sandwich because she saw a little girll who was thrilled over the simple act of having a hot lunch.\nI will never forget her for her compassion and generosity.",
