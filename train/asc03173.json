  "article": "There was once a king who had a wise advisor. The advisor followed the king everywhere and his favorite piece of advice to the king was \"Everything happens for the good.\"\nOne day the king went hunting   and had a small accident. His foot was injured. Fortunately, he was not badly injured but as always he was forced to ask his advisor what he thought about the accident, to which the advisor replied, \"Everything happens for the good.\"\nThis time the king was really angry and put his advisor in prison  . The king then asked his advisor, \"Now, what do you think?\" The advisor again answered, \"Everything happens for the good.\"\nAbout a week later the king went on another hunting trip. As it turned out the king was caught by some cannibals   and taken to their camp where he would be prepared to be their evening meal. Before putting him into the cooking pot, he was examined and the cannibals realized that the king's foot was injured. They decided to throw him back into the forests. It is the tradition for the cannibals not to eat anything that was in any way injured.\nIt is true that everything in our lives happens for a purpose, and most often for our own good. If you think about it, all our past experiences actually happened to bring us to where we are today and make us a better person. So whatever challenges that we may face today, consider it happening to bring us to the next level.",
