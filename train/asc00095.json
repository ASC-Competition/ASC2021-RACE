  "article": "An estimated eight million people in Britain enjoy walking in the Peak District every year. But what many who enjoy outdoor hobbies don't know is that their \"right to walk\" was won by men who sacrificed their own freedom to gain access to the countryside for all.\nIn 1932 wealthy landowners had private use of large areas of uplands for hunting. Walkers were kept out by guards, until a group of 400 people from Manchester and Yorkshire, led by Benny Rothman, engaged on a mass trespass . The campaigner was put into prison with four other men.\nThe event is supported by many with starting a movement that paved the way for the establishment of national parks. Mr Rothman died in 2002 but he is now being honoured for his contribution with the revealing of a blue plaque  on his former home in Crofton Avenue, Timperley, Greater Manchester.\nRetired professor, Harry, who followed in his father's footsteps by specialising in environmental issues, says: \"He was a very optimistic man and he made the best of it when he went to prison. It did''t put him off campaigning, he went on campaigning on environmental issues most of his life.\" Mr Rothman did live to see the Countryside Rights of Way Act passed by Parliament in 2000, ensuring the freedom of the countryside for future generations.\nRoly Smith, a friend of Mr Rothman and an author of walking guidebooks, said: \"It is because of them that we have got what we have today.\"\nCouncillor Jonathan Coupe, of Trafford Council, said: \"The honour of having a blue plaque attributed  to you means you have really made an impression on society.\"\n\"Mr Rothman contributed to the changing of history and it is because of him that we are able to enjoy the local countryside as often and freely as we can today.\"",
