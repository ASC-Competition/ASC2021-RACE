  "article": "Simon hardly listened to his teachers or worked hard in class. For him, talking was so much better. He never stopped talking. He wanted to be heard. \"If you listen carefully, you'll learn something.\" Mrs. Jacobs told him many times, but it didn't work.\nLast Sunday, Simon had a sore throat   and he lost his voice the next morning. \"Can I stay home?\" he tried to ask, but words didn't come out. His mother thought he could go to school. He felt upset.\nWhen he got to school, he didn't say anything to his friends or teachers. Everyone started talking at once. They were excited, worried and surprised. Mrs. Jacobs seemed happy. Simon was bored because he couldn't talk.\nBut it wasn't so bad. He could do his homework. The next day,  even though his voice was coming back, he stayed quiet again. He listened and put up his hand to speak. What a great difference!\n,.",
