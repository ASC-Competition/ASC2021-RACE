  "article": "Do you want to live a happier, less stressful   life?\nTry laughing for no reason at all. That's how thousands of people start their day at Laughter Clubs around the world - and many doctors now think that having a good laugh might be one of the best ways to stay healthy.\nThe first Laughter Club was started in Mumbai, India, in 1995 by Dr Madan Kataria. \"Young children laugh about 300 times a day. Adults laugh between 7 and 15 times a day,\" says Dr Kataria. \"Everyone's naturally good at laughing - it's the universal language. We want people to feel happy with their lives.\" There are now more than 500 Laughter Clubs in India and over 1,300 worldwide.\nMany doctors are also interested in the effects   of laughter on our health. According to a 5 - year study in the body. Laughter improves our health against illness by about 40%.\nSo, what happens at a Laughter Club? I went along to my nearest club in South London to find out. I was quite nervous at the beginning of the class, to be honest - I wasn't interested in laughing with a group of strangers, and I was worried about looking stupid. Our laughter teacher told us to clap our hands and say \"ho ho ho, ha ha ha,\" while looking at each other. However, our bodies can't tell the difference between fake laughter and real laughter, so they still produce the same healthy effects.\nSurprisingly, it works! After ten minutes everybody in the room was laughing for real - and some people just couldn't stop! At the end of the class I was surprised by how relaxed and comfortable I felt. So if you're under stress, then start laughing. You might be very pleased with the results!",
