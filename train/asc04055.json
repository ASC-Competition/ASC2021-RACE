  "article": "Jiajia, a third grader who was born with anemia, a medical condition in which there are too few red cells in blood, wrote an affecting article that moved many netizens.\nIn the article, she shared her biggest wish: to survive so she could take care of her grandparents. Jiajia, 9, currently lives in the city of Suining in Sichuan province. In the article, she writes, \"My heart gets heavier each time I see my grandma cry for me. If I ever get to grow up, I will take good care of her.\"\nJiajia contracted pneumonia when she was 4 months old. Since then, she has required a blood transfusion every two weeks.\nAfter her parents' divorce, her grandparents took her in and faced many challenges in the process of raising her. The girl's article was only 235 words long, and it was handed in as a school assignment.\nNevertheless, Jiajia's words \"deeply impressed\" her elementary school teacher, who then posted the article online, where it struck a chord with many people.\nUp till now, a fund started by teachers at Jiajia's school has reached more than 30,000 RMB, which will be put toward Jiajia's future blood transfusions.",
