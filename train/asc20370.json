  "article": "It was Jimmy's birthday, and he was five years old. He got quite a lot of nice birthday presents from his family, and one of them was a beautiful big drum .\n\"Who gave him that thing?\" Jimmy's father said when he saw it. \"His grandfather did,\" answered Jimmy's mother. \"Oh,\" said his father. Of course , Jimmy liked his drum very much. He made a terrible noise  with it, but his father did not mind . His father was working during the day, and Jimmy was in bed when he got home in the evening, so he did not hear the noise.\nBut one of the neighbors  did not like the noise at all , so a few days later, she took a sharp  knife and went to Jimmy's house while Jimmy was hitting  his drum. She said to him, \"Hello, Jimmy. Do you know, there's something very nice inside your drum. Here's a knife. Open the drum and let's find it. \"",
