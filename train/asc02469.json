  "article": "People with an impulsive personality refer to those who tend to do things without considering the possible dangers or problems first. According to a new study by researchers at the University of Georgia, such people may be more likely to have food addiction. The study found that people exhibiting impulsive behavior weren't necessarily overweight, but impulsiveness was related to a direct relationship with food, and therefore, less healthy weight.\nFood addiction has been compared to addictive drug use. Studies have linked the dopamine   release that occurs after tasting delicious food to the dopamine release that happens when people consume other addictive substances.\nImpulsive behavior involves several personality traits  . Two of these traits, known as negative urgency and lack of perseverance, were particularly associated with food addiction and high BMI   during the study.\nNegative urgency is characterized by the tendency to behave impulsively when experiencing negative emotions. Some people might drink alcohol or take drugs. For others, it could mean eating to feel better. Lack of perseverance is when a person has a hard time finishing hard or boring tasks. People with a lack of perseverance might have difficulty attempting to change addictive eating behavior, which could also cause obesity.\n\"Impulsiveness might be one reason why some people eat in an addictive way despite motivation to lose weight,\" said Dr. Ashley Gearhardt, a clinical psychologist. He was involved in developing the Yale Food Addiction Scale in aid of those people. \"We are theorizing that if food addiction is really a thing, then our measure, the Yale Food Addiction Scale, should be related to helping control impulsive action,\" said Gearhardt.\nClinical psychologist Dr. James MacKillop, whose lab was conducting the study, believes that therapies used to treat addictive drug behavior could help people who suffer from addictive eating habits.\n\"Most of the programs for weight loss at this point focus on the most obvious things, which are clearly diet and exercise,\" MacKillop said. \"It seems that managing strong desires to eat would naturally fit in with the skills a person would need to eat healthily.\"",
