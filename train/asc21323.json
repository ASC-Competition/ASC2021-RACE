  "article": "Dogs have long been regarded as a loyal  friend of humans. They are not only a good companion to their owners, but also a security guard in some way. However, in fact, dogs do more things than just that. Recently, a British middle school has invited a dog to the classroom. Why? For fun? For security? Or for experiments?\nFlossie, a ten-month-old poodle, says \"No\" to all the above guesses. He is there to help increase students' reading confidence. It is a little hard to believe, but it's real.\nVice-headmaster Sue Frost is responsible for training and taking care of the dog. She said, \"Flossie has a great _ on students.They are willing to read for him. This is really a good way for students to learn more new words and make new progress.\"\nFlossie is quite popular among students. Jacob Wicks, an 11-year-old schoolboy, entered the school last November. He said, \"I think Flossie is a lovely dog. He always listens to me quietly when I am reading. There is no need for me to worry about negative comments if I don't read well.\" Another student named Jordan Leatherhead said that he liked reading Guinness world Records for Flossie, and that Flossie like listening to him because there are many records about dogs and other animals in the book.\nWow! This is really an interesting teaching method. Why not have a try if you have a pet dog at home?\n,.",
