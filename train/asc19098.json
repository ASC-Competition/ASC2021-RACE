Go and get me something to eat.\"\"I can't do that now, tiger.\" the monkey says,\"There is another tiger over there . He doesn't let me get anything for you to eat. I am afraid of   him.\" \"What?\" says the old tiger. \"Take me to the tiger. I want to talk to him.\" The monkey and the tiger go to the bridge  over the river . \"Now look down at the water.\" says the monkey. \"Do you see the tiger?\" \"Yes, I do.\" says the old tiger. \"Let me eat him.\" Then the tiger jumps  into the river.",
