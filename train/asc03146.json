  "article": "There are some strange driving laws in different countries.\nVietnam:  If you're in Vietnam without a Vietnamese driver's license, you risk a prison sentence of up to 3years.\nRussia:  In Moscow, if your car is dirty enough to draw dust art, you will be fined about 2,000 rubles. Worse yet, it's not legal to wash your car by hand in public places--forcing you to take it to one of the few car wash facilities.\nThailand:  Drivers--males or females--can't drive shirtless, whether it's a car, a bus or a tuk-tuk.\nFrance:  France requires its drivers to carry a potable breathalyzer  all the time when driving a car. The one-time breathalyzer cost around US $ 5, and if you don't have one, you will be fined US $ 15.\nCyprus: Raising your hands in the car can get you fined of US $ 35. The law states a driver can be fined if the person is not in a regular position inside the car or raises his hands from the steering wheel unnecessarily.\nJapan:  Politeness isn't just the culture in Japan; it's part of driving laws. Splashing a person by driving through a puddle  with your car will cost you over US $ 60. The country is also strict with its DUI  laws---riding with or lending your car to a driver who gets caught drinking can lead to a fine costing thousands of dollars.",
