  "article": "Almost everyone stood when the bride walked down the aisle in her white dress,but not the wedding conductor,because she was fixed on her chair.\nThe wedding was led by \"IFairy\",a 1.5meter tall seated robot with flashing eyes and plastic hair. Sunday's wedding was the first time a marriage had been led by a robot,according to manufacturer,Kokoro Co.\n\"Please lift the bride's veil  ,\" the robot said in a tinny voice,waving its arms in the air as the newlymarried couple kissed in front of about 50 guests.\nThe wedding took place at a restaurant in Hibiya Park in central Tokyo,where the IFairy wore flowers and directed a rooftop ceremony. Wires led out from beneath it to a black curtain a few feet away,where a man clicked commands into a computer.\nJapan has one of the most advanced robotics industries in the world,with the government actively supporting the field for future growth. Industrial models in factories are now standard,but recently Japanese companies have been making a push to inject robots into everyday life.\nHonda makes a walking childshaped robot,and other firms have developed robots to entertain the elderly or play baseball. Kokoro,whose corporate goal is to \"touch the hearts of the people\",also makes giant dinosaur robots for exhibitions and lifelike Android models that can smile and laugh. The company is a subcompany of Sanrio Co.,which owns the rights to Hello Kitty and other Japanese characters.\n\"This was a lot of fun. I think that Japanese people have a strong sense that robots are our friends. Those in the robot industry mostly understand this,but people mainly want robots near them to serve some purpose,\" said the bride,Satoko Inoue,36,who works at Kokoro.\nThe IFairy sells for about 6.3 million yen ($68,000) and three are in use in Singapore,the US and Japan,according to company spokeswoman,Kayako Kido.",
