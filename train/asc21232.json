  "article": "After two weeks, Ling Qinghao finally sent a message to his wife in their hometown in Anhui, and told her her he was safe.\nLing, 44, was a Chinese construction worker who went to Libya. The recent problems in Libya have left the country in disorder. Several Chinese were injured last month.\nLing was one of the thousands of Chinese evacuees   from Libya. The evacuee's first stop was Greece. They are staying there in a five-star hotel that the Chinese government paid for. According to the Foreign Ministry, by March 2, China has evacuated   a total of 35,860 Chinese from Libya. Among them, 20745 have already returned to China.\nTo evacuate means to quickly move people away from a disaster or disorder. An evacuation tests how a nation would deal with an emergency  . From getting flight tickets to dealing with customs services , many parts of the government and companies have to work together.\nTo protect the safety of overseas Chinese, China took action quickly. Since February 24, the nation has sent out airplanes and ships to evacuate its people from Libya.They even sent a navy ship to help. This is the first time that China has sent the army in an evacuation.\n\"We have done a great job in no more than 10 days. This shows China's ability to protect its people overseas in emergencies,\" Vice Foreign Minister Song Tao said.",
