  "article": "I stepped into my hotel room to a pleasant surprise. Lots of room surrounded an inviting king-size bed, with armchairs nearby resting against sliding glass doors that opened onto a private yard. A small dining table sat next to a kitchen with a refrigerator and coffee machine. \"Wow,\" I thought to myself. \"Nice place.\"\nI love hotels. I love to enter a clean room, hang my clothes and gaze out the window, walk out in the morning and when I return, someone else will have made the bed. I like in-room dining and the way they greet you so professionally. \"Nice to have you with us again, Mr. Goldsborough.\" Very cool.\nThe problem is that unless Alison travels with me, I never sleep well in hotels. I miss my family, even though Linus and Camille, at ages 4 and almost 2, find a way to interrupt even the best night's sleep at home.\nI'm deeply troubled by the number of parents who wake up too late with the realization:\n\"My children grew up too fast. In the busy career and corporate rat race , I missed their childhood.\" What they fail to say but too often think causes me even more pain: \"...and I barely even know them.\"\nA hundred years from now, no one will remember the size of your bank account, the car you drove or the size of your house. The world might differ greatly however, based on your impact in the life of a small child. If you pay attention to your significant others, make the choice to put them first.\nThink of one specific action that you can take, and take it. Then think of another one and take that, too. Challenge yourself to find new ways to express your appreciation and love on a daily basis. It will pay off ten-fold at home.",
