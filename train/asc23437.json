  "article": "In Britain, people usually begin their talks with weather. For example, they will say\"It's a fine day, isn't it?\"\"Do you think it will rain?\"\nMany people believe that they are able to tell what the weather will be like. But they never agree with each other. One man may say, \"How cloudy   it is now! It's going to rain.\" Another man will say, \"No, it's going to be fine later.\"\nPeople always hope the weather they want. For example, when a farmer needs water, he looks for something to tell him it's going to rain. When a man wants to travel, he is sure the weather will be fine quickly.\nNow almost everyone listens to the weather report. It doesn't always tell us the weather we want, it only tells us what the weather will be like. But sometimes it makes mistakes .\n,.",
