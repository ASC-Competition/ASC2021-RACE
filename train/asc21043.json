  "article": "This is a picture of the twin brothers Li Lei and Li Ping's bedroom. It's not big, but it's very bright. It's a nice room. In the bedroom, we can see two beds, two chairs, two desks, a table and a cat. The two beds look the same. On the wall, there are some pictures of their family. Li Lei's green coat is on his bed, but his blue shoes are under his chair. Their books and pencil-boxes are on their desks. We can see some flowers and a clock on Li Ping's desk. Li Lei's schoolbag is behind his chair, but Li Ping's is on his chair. Where is their white cat? Oh, it's under Li Lei's bed.",
