  "article": "About a year ago, I went to stay at a Detroit hotel. I didn't want to carry too much money with me, so I asked the desk clerk to put a one-hundred-dollar bill in the safe for me. \n    The next morning, however, the clerk said he knew nothing about my money. I didn't have any proof that I had given the man the money. There was nothing I could do but go to the nearest lawyer.\n    The lawyer advised me to return to the hotel with him and give another one-hundred-dollar bill to the clerk. This I did. An hour later, I went back to the desk alone and asked for my money. Since I had the lawyer as an eyewitness to the second one-hundred-dollar bill, the clerk could not say he knew nothing about it.\nAnother hour later, I put the second part of the lawyer's plan into action. This time both the lawyer and I went to the hotel. I asked for the one-hundred-dollar bill once again, and when the clerk insisted he had already given it to me, I denied it. The lawyer said to him, \"I saw this gentleman give you a hundred dollars. If you don't hand it over immediately, I'll be forced to call the police.\"\n    The clerk realized he had been tricked, so he gave me back the first one-hundred-dollar bill.\n    \"I don't know how to thank you enough for getting my money back,\" I said to the lawyer. And what do you suppose he answered me?\n    He said, \"Oh, don't thank me. That will be a hundred dollars, please.\"",
