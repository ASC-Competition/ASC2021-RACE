  "article": "Most damagingly, anger weakens a person's ability to think clearly and keep control over his behaviour. The angry person loses objectivity in evaluating the emotional significance of the person or situation that arouses his anger.\nNot everyone experiences anger in the same way; what angers one person may amuse another. The specific expression of anger also differs from person to person based on biological and cultural forces. In contemporary culture, physical expressions of anger are generally considered too socially harmful to be tolerated. We no longer regard duels  as an appropriate expression of anger resulting from one person's awareness of insulting behaviour on the part of another.\nAnger can be identified in the brain, where the electrical activity changes. Under most conditions EEG  measures of electrical activity show balanced activity between the right and left prefrontal  areas. Behaviourally this corresponds to the general evenhanded disposition  that most of us possess most of the time. But when we are angry the EEG of the right and left prefrontal areas aren't balanced and, as a result of this, we're likely to react. And our behavioural response to anger is different from our response to other emotions, whether positive or negative.\nMost positive emotions are associated with approach behaviour: we move closer to people we like. Most negative emotions, in contrast, are associated with avoidance behaviour: we move away from people and things that we dislike or that make us anxious. But anger is an exception to this pattern. The angrier we are, the more likely we are to move towards the object of our anger. This corresponds to what psychologists refer to as offensiveanger: the angry person moves closer in order to influence and control the person or situation causing his anger. This approachandconfront behaviour is accompanied by a leftward prefrontal asymmetry  of EEG activity. Interestingly, this asymmetry lessens if the angry person can experience empathy  towards the individual who is bringing forth the angry response. In defensiveanger, in contrast, the EEG asymmetry is directed to the right and the angry person feels helpless in the face of the angerinspiring situation.",
