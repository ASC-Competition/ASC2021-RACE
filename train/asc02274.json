How you choose to learn from your experiences,or even apply them as transferable job skills,will make all the difference.\"\n _ \n\"Make at least one local friend,\"says Matthew,co-founder of Students Gone Global. \"Join a club,community service group,or a sports league -- it will help you form a network and find people you click with.
