  "article": "It is the last day of June today. It is grandma's birthday. Father, mother and I go to see her.\nMy grandma lives with my uncle in a village not too far away. Uncle works there. Early in the morning we buy a birthday cake and some fruit and go to her home by bus.\nGrandma and uncle are very glad to see us. We give the present to grandma and say, \"Happy birthday to you!\" She is very happy. Then we sit down to talk. Uncle goes to prepare lunch. The meal is very nice. We all enjoy it very much. At 4 o'clock, we say goodbye and go back home.",
