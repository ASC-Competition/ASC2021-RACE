  "article": "We were on our way home from Houston one Saturday morning. We decided to stop at a local gas station to get coffee and something to snack on since it was a good hour and a half before we got home.\nWhen we were done, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a man standing outside in front of the building. He was a homeless man with worn clothes and it looked like he had gone in and gotten himself some coffee or something warm to drink since it was cold this time of the year. He must have not had enough money to get something to eat.\nThen a dog walked up to the front of the building. I could tell she was a \"she\", because you could tell that she had baby dogs. She was terribly in need of something to eat and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her baby dogs would not make it.\nI and my wife sat there and looked at her. We noticed that people walked by and didn't even pet her, like most people do when they walk by an animal in front of a store. We still did not do anything. But the homeless man, who I thought did not buy himself anything to eat, went back into the store. And what he did brought tears to me and my wife. He had gone into the store and with what money he may have had, bought a can of dog food and fed that dog.\nThis story plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend. And a lot of people forget that some animals are parents too.\nIt took a homeless man, to show me what I should have done. He make me a better man that day.",
