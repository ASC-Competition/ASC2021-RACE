  "article": "At any given time, hundreds of postcards are in transit   across the world as strangers communicate through a movement called Post-crossing.\nEmma Delaney says it's a sad day when there isn't a postcard in her mailbox. She doesn't have a bunch of friends travelling overseas at the moment ---- she's just really active in the underground hobby of Postcrossing.\n\"I've sent over 3,000 postcards, but I've been doing it for close to seven years,\" she says. \"My husband, generally appreciative of my hobby, is sometimes frustrated by the amount of cardboard hanging around the house or in my car.\"\nPostcrossing is a hobby where strangers send each other postcards across the world. You register on the website, list your interests and preferences for postcards, then receive an address of a stranger on the other side of the world to send a postcard to.\n\"I tend to send a lot of postcards of the local area because people are interested in where you're from and what you do,\" Emma says.\nFrom Uzbekistan to Belarus and Kazakhstan to Moldova, Emma has a growing collection of photos from around the world. The postcards have helped shape her international travelling too. \"I didn't travel overseas until I was 32 and a lot of the locations we chose for our honeymoon were selected because of the postcards I'd received.\"\n\"Some people see sending mail as being a bit boring and unfashionable, but Postcrossing is popular and lots of people are fascinated that I do it.,\"\nThe Postcrossing project has just celebrated its eighth birthday and has over 400,000 active members in 215 countries. The group says they've delivered over 18 million postcards.\nAnd while postal workers aren't supposed to read people's postcards, Emma says she's happy for them to do so at her post office in Shellharbour. She even encourages her correspondents to say hello to the Australia Post staff.\n\"It's a hobby that I continue to do because I find it enjoyable and relaxing.\"",
