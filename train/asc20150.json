  "article": "Strong earthquakes hit the east of Japan in the afternoon of March 11, causing several meter-high tsunami , which killed more than 10,000 people in areas along the coast. Several nuclear plants  at the coast were broken by the earthquake and tsunami. People living near the plants have been asked to move away. People living within 30 kilometers of the first plant are asked to stay indoors and close all windows.\nThe breaking of the nuclear plants is causing electricity shortages  in Eastern Japan. As a result, electricity is cut off for 3-hour periods in the area of Tokyo and some other areas during daytime. In order to save electricity, some shops, restaurants and tourist places in the areas are closed for some time every day.  But all major airports and train lines are still open and operating.\nFor the above reasons, tourists are _ not to visit the eastern areas in the near future. Visits to Western Japan are not affected by the event. People who plan to travel over the coming weeks and months are advised to pay attention to the situation for a few more days before making decisions.",
