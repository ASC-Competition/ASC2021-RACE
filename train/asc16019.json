  "article": "Once upon a time the colors of the world started to quarrel. All believed that they were the most important.\n\" Clearly I am the most important. I am the sign of life and of hope. Without me, all animals would die. \" Green said.\n\" You only think about the earth,\" Blue interrupted, \" but consider the sky and the sea. The sky gives space, peace and serenity. Without my peace, you would all be nothing. \"\nYellow shouted, \" You are all so serious. I bring laughter and warmth into the world. Without me there would be no fun. \"\nOrange started next , \" I am the color of health and strength. My beauty is so striking that no one gives another thought to any of you. \"\nRed could stand it no longer, he shouted out, \" I am the ruler of all of you. I am the color of danger and of bravery. Without me, the earth would be an empty as the moon. \"\nPurple rose up to his full height. He was very tall and spoke with great pomp , \" I am the color of loyalty  and power. I am the sign of authority  and wisdom. People do not question me! They listen and obey. \"\nFinally Indigo  spoke, much more quietly than all the others, \" I represent thought and reflection . You need me for balance and contrast . \"\nTheir quarreling became louder and louder. Suddenly there was a flash of lightning. Rain started to pour down and speak \" You should stretch across the sky in a great bow of color. Remember to appreciate one another. Only the rainbow is the most beautiful. \"",
