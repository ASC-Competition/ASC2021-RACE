  "article": "At the age of ten I could not figure out what this Elvis Presley guy had that the rest of us boys did not have.I mean,he had a head,two arms and two legs,just like the rest of us.About nine o'clock on Saturday morning I decided to ask Eugene Correthers,one of the older boys,what it was that made this Elvis guy so special.He told me that it was Elvis'wavy hair and the way he moved his body.\nAbout half an hour later all the boys in the orphanage were called to the main dining-room and told we were all going to downtown Jacksonville,Florida to get a new pair of Buster Brown shoes and a haircut. _ . If the Elvis hair cut was the big secret,then that's what I was going to get.\nA11 the way to town I told everybody, including the matron from the orphanage who was taking us to town,that I was going to look just like Elvis Presley and that I would learn to move around just like he did and that I would be rich and famous one day, just like him.\nWhen I got my new Buster Brown shoes, I could hardly wait for my new hair cut and now that I had my new Busier Brown shoes I would be very happy to go back to the orphanage and practice being like Elvis.\nWe finally arrived at the big barber shop,where they cut our hair for free because we were orphans .I looked at the barber and said,\"I want an Elvis hair cut. Can you make my hair like Elvis?\"I asked him,with a big smile on my face.\"Let's just see what we can do for you,little man,\"he said.I was so happy when he started to cut my hair.Just as he started to cut my hair, the matron signed for him to come over to where she was standing.She whispered something into his ear and then he shook his head,like he was telling her\"No\".Then he told me they were not allowed to give us Elvis hair cuts.Then I saw my hair falling onto the floor.",
