  "article": "Once school is out for the summer, students can begin their vacation trips in the great state of New Hampshire. Here are some low budget destinations.\nCannon Mountain\nIt is not only the well-known oldest ski area in the US, but a top summer destination. The site offers views of the attractions of NH's Old Man of the Mountain, and the nests of eagles from the surrounding mount. You can treat yourselves to not only the small train ride, but a walk through the US ski museum and a hike along the small road. Feel free to choose a picnic lunch, or eat in the hotel. To comfortably enjoy the Cannon Mountain trip, plan to bring $20 per person in your group.\nMount Washington Auto Road\nNo trip to New Hampshire is complete without taking a drive up to the Mount Washington Auto Road. At $28 per vehicle and driver, plus $8 for each adult, you can arrive at the mountain top. You can start your trip to the highest top in the northeast, where you can spend a day climbing the rocks, exploring the weather station and the hiker rest area.\nCruising on Lake Winnipesaukee\nLake Winnipesaukee offers seasonal trips on the largest lake in New Hampshire. Summer cruises are designed for all the visitors, from plants tours and houses visiting to evening dinner cruises. Tickets change from $15 to $123 depending on the number of visitors and the season.\nPrescott Park Arts Festival\nSince 1974, the Prescott Park Arts Festival in Portsmouth has been hosting a free theater experience in the lovely river side Prescott Park. Past performances have included Annie, Shrek the Musical, and other plays. These community theater programs are a delight. And they run from June to August, with both evening shows and afternoon concerts.",
