  "article": "Fred is a dog. He always wants to have everything for himself. He doesn't like to share his food or toys with other dogs.\nOne day, he was running in a field, and found a large bone in the bushes. He was so happy! He thought, \"Wow! This is the biggest bone in the world! And it's all mine! I should put it somewhere. Another dog may try to steal  it.\"\n\"I'll run very far,\" he thought. \"That way, no other dogs will find my bone.\" One hour later, he saw a small river and a bridge, \"I'll cross the bridge, and put my bone on the other side,\" thought Fred. Then, he began to cross the bridge.\nHe looked down, and saw a dog with a bone in the water. He thought it was another dog with another bone! \"There is a dog in the water. I want his bone too!\" thought Fred. Then, he opened his mouth and tried to grab   the other bone.\nSplash! His bone fell into the water. \"Oh, no! My bone is gone!\" he thought. \"Now I have nothing.\"",
