  "article": "My sister Alli and I have been trying to get people to stop dropping cigarette butts  for seven years. One day, we were walking in our hometown and saw hundreds of cigarette butts on the ground. They made the town look so ugly that we decided to start a group to make people stop dropping butts. We called it \"No Butts About It\". At first, we drew pictures with \"The Earth is Not Your Ashtray \" written on them. We put the pictures around our hometown---in parks, by beaches, and along roads. We wanted to make people understand that dropping butts hurts the environment. Most smokers don't think that dropping butts hurts the earth. But it does! All rubbish does. Later, we wrote to companies and asked them for money to help us. We used the money to buy ashtrays to give smokers. We wanted smokers to carry the ashtrays with them so they didn't have to drop butts. At the moment, we are trying to get cigarette companies to put an ashtray in each pack of cigarettes. Some companies want to do it.\nMany people have started to join our group since it began. Today there are 45 other \"No Butts About It\" groups in America. And there are even groups in England, Australia and India! Many newspapers have written about my sister and I over the last seven years. And we have won many prizes for our good work.\nBut we are not interested in prizes. We just want to make the earth a better and cleaner place for animals, plants and people. One day it will be.",
