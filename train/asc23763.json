  "article": "Information is received into our brain by attention, and its quality determines   how well _ will be processed, saved and used afterwards.\nAll information we receive is chosen by our attention. Factors   affecting   our attention are personal interest, experience, ability, feelings, knowledge, environment, timing, and so on. The same information may attract different forms and levels of attention from different people. Some people can get and save the information easily; some may have great difficulty; while others may just turn a blind eye to it. To the same information, one may even pay different levels of attention at different times. But if the facts work together, the quality of attention may be better. Therefore, it is not surprising to see that somebody with average intelligence   can have excellent performances in some fields.\nThe good news is that a person's attention can be shaped, trained and made stronger by effective exercise. With this in mind, we should keep improving the quality of our attention.",
