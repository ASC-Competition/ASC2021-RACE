  "article": "Many young people in America go to camps when they are out of school during the summer. They are offered a chance to explore different things: nature, sports, music, technology ----even business and economy.\nOne such program for high school students in the Pacific Northwest is called Washington Business Week. The program began in 1975. Officials say forty-five thousand people have attended Washington Business Week. Other states now have similar camps.\nWashington Business Week describes itself as a way to learn more about how to plan for the future in an ever-changing economy. Students form an executive  management   team. They lead an imaginary company to financial success.\nThe camp is held at three colleges in Washington State. The high school students live in the college housing. The cost of the camp is almost three hundred dollars, but families can receive financial assistance .\nSome business camps are free. These are for students from poor areas. The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) is an organization based in New York City that supports such camps. It has programs around the United States and its Web site lists international partners in China, Tanzania and a few other countries. NFTE says it has served more than one hundred thousand young people since 1987.\nAmong other business camps is Camp C.E.O.. C.E.O is an chief executive officer. And this camp is for girls only. Camp C.E.O. is supported by the Girl Scouts of America and takes place for one week each summer.\nThe camp took place last month in Tennessee. The girls worked with successful businesswomen\nfrom different industries. The girls learned how to build a business and develop an idea into a product. And, we imagine, they also had some fun.",
