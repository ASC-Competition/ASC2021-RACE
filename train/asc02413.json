Examples are directions for making or doing something, arithmetic  problems, science and history books, which are full of important information. You must read such things slowly to remember each important step and understand each important ideas.\n* Some things should be read rapidly throughout. Examples are  simple stories meant for enjoyment, news letters from friends, pieces of news from local, or home-town, papers, telling what is happening to friends and neighbors.\n* In some of your reading, you must change your speed from fast to slow and slow to fast, as you go along. You will need to read certain pages rapidly and then slow down and do more careful reading when you come to important ideas which must be remembered.",
