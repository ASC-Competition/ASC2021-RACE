  "article": "Have you ever wanted to see the Great Wall of China, or win an Oscar for Best Director, or swim with dolphins ? If so, you are not alone. We all have things we want to do or achieve. These are part of our \"bucket lists\". A bucket is a list of things that someone wants to experience in his or her lifetimes. These things can be big or small. Have you ever thought about what is on your bucket list?\nLindsay, 15, created her bucket list when she was 14. She has given her list serious thought. \"I've always wanted to travel into space,\" she says. \"I don't really want to be an astronaut. But I do want to go to space as a tourist. I want to see the Earth from above.\" Other things on her list include being on TV, seeing her favorite band in concert, learning how to speak Portuguese , and living in a foreign country. \"I've always wanted to live in Brazil. As part of my bucket list, I want to attend Carnival in the capital of Brazil,\" she says.\nJose, 16, recently created a list of things he wants to achieve. It changes sometimes he adds and takes away things because he wants to keep the number of the things at seven. One thing has stayed at number one, though: he wants to visit a movie set . He would like to see the Harry Potter of The Hobbit movie sets. Other things on the list include being on TV, meeting his favorite sports star, living in a foreign country, skateboarding down a mountain, attending the World Cup, and backpacking across Europe. He would like to spend two months visiting Eastern Europe with his best friend Adam. \"Maybe after I graduate from college,\" says Jose.\nCarrie, 14, also has a bucket list. She first created it when she was 12. She would like to live in a foreign country for at least two years. She also wants to learn as many foreign languages as possible. But the number one thing on her list is to see her favorite band in concert. She also wants to go on a trip and to visit a movie set. Her favorite movies are the Hunger Games and Star Wars. Carrie is confident she will do most or all of the things on her bucket list. \"I'm only 14,\" she says, \"I have my whole life ahead of me!\"",
