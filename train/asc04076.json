  "article": "Finally, the long-awaited flying car is almost here.\nAeroMobil, a Slovakian company, plans to start selling its creation, the AeroMobil3. 0, in 2017. The company claims on its site that the vehicle \"transforms in seconds from an automobile to an airplane\" by using \"existing infrastructure created for automobiles and planes.\"The vehicle is petrol-powered and has wings that fold, which allows it to be parked like a car, though it is nearly 20 feet long.\nThe company's website features a video where the AeroMobil 3. 0 drives out of a hangar (  )and goes down a highway, sharing the road with ordinary cars until it arrives at an airstrip. The car then unfolds its wings and takes off from a stretch of grass, rather than a paved tarmac  , and flies through the air like any other small airplane.\nAeroMobil spokesman Stefan Vadocz said his company hasn't decided on an exact price because it's not ready yet.\"The prototype is a work in progress,\" he said in an email. But he said the price would be several hundreds of thousands of euros---somewhere in between a sports car and a light sports aircraft.\nThe vehicle seats two people---the pilot and a passenger---and its single propeller   is located at the rear of the plane. The company said the car's top speed on the road is at least 99 mph and while flying it is at least 124 mph. It can fly for 435 miles before running out of fuel. It has a steel framework and carbon coating and is powered by a Rotax 912, a four-cylinder   aircraft engine from BRP of Austria.\nFlying cars aren't exactly new. The concept has been around since long before The Jetsons popularized the idea in the 1960s. It has been a regular topic in Popular Science ever since World War I ace, Eddie Rickenbacker, wrote about it in 1924.\nBut getting a practical, reliable flying car off the ground has been a serious challenge.\nGlenn Curtiss discovered this in 1918 when he developed the Curtiss Autoplane. It turned out to be more of a hopper than a flyer, so it failed to become popular with the public.",
