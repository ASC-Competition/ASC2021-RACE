For example, ask them questions about their day. How is work? They love this.\nMake it clear what you want to tell your parents. If they have an opinion, let them finish and don't stop their talking. Ask them to do the same for you.\nShow them respect by listening to them carefully. Look at them in the eye.\nBe honest. Honesty builds trust. Life is good when your parents trust you.\nIf your parents don't understand, that's OK. It doesn't mean that they don't love you. Sometimes you have to explain the things to them again.\nWhen you finish the talk, thank them for listening. Say something like \"Thanks, that helps.\" It will let them know that is important to you and make them want to do it more often.",
