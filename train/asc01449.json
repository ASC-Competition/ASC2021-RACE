  "article": "Researchers who study relationships have discovered that a big difference between those who make new friends easily, and those who don't, is that socially successful people tend to make eye contact with their conversation partners much more frequently than those who are less successful socially. In fact, you may be able to become much more socially successful by making this one simple change to your behavior.\nMost Americans prefer to have a lot of eye contact when they are talking with someone. When a person doesn't make eye contact with them, they tend to think that the person is hiding something or the person doesn't believe in himself/herself.\nWhen you are having a conversation and you want to leave a friendly impression, be sure to keep looking at that person frequently while you are talking. If it really bothers you to look directly into another person's eyes, you can gaze generally at, not above, the eyebrow area or the bridge of the nose; this is close enough to the eye region that you will appear to be looking at the person's eyes. But neither the hair or the shoulders have the same effect. Don't stare at other people too intensely, otherwise, you will look aggressive .\nKeep the majority of your focus on the other person. If you glance around the room too much, or look too frequently at other people, your conversation partner may guess that you are looking around for someone else you would rather talk with.\nYou can lighten your nervousness by smiling more often, nodding, and by gazing at the entire face as well as the eyes. In addition, you can frequently look away for very short periods.\nWhen people get the sense that you are really paying attention to them, they will be much more likely to want to have conversations with you!",
