  "article": "John and Bobby joined the same company together just after they completed their university studies the same year. Both of them worked very hard. Several years later, however, the boss promoted  Bobby to manager but John was still a worker. John could not take it, and gave his resignation  to the boss. He complained that the boss did not think much of those who were hard -working, but promoted only those who flattered him.\nThe boss knew that John had worked very hard for the years. He thought a moment and said, \"Thank you for what you said, but I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave\"\nJohn agreed. The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling watermelons. The boss asked how much they cost every kilogram. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 every kilogram.\nThe boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to come to his office.  He asked Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. Bobby went and returned, saying, \"Boss, only one person is selling watermelons. $1.2 every kilogram, and $10 for 10 kilograms. The seller has 340 melons. On the table there are 58 melons, and each weighs about 2 kilograms. They were brought from the South two days ago. They are of good quality.\"\nHearing what Bobby said, John realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided to stay and learn from Bobby.",
