  "article": "The people of ancient Egypt began their new year in summer. That is when the Nile River flooded its banks, bringing water and fertility   to the land. Today, most people celebrate New Year's Day on January 1. People celebrate the New Year's holiday in many different ways.\nThe ancient Babylonians celebrated by forcing their king to give up his crown ( )and royal clothing. They made him get down on his knees and _ all the mistakes he had made during the past year.\nMaking New Year's resolutions is a common American tradition. Today, popular resolutions might include the promise to lose weight, stop smoking, or be more productive  at work. People offer New Year's resolutions of their own. For example, one person decided to get a cat. Another promised to stop telling stories about other people. Other people use New Year's resolutions to make major changes in their lives. One such resolution might be to \"stop and smell the flowers.\" This means to take time to enjoy simple pleasures. Another resolution might be \"don't sweat the small stuff.\" This means not to worry or get angry about unimportant problems. Another resolution might be to forget about bad things that happened in the past.",
