  "article": "Most American families are smaller than the families in other countries. Most American families have one or two parents and one or two children each.\nChildren in the US will leave their parents' home when they grow up. They usually live far from their parents because they want to find good jobs. They often write to their parents or telephone them. And they often go to visit their parents on holiday.\nParents usually let their children choose their own jobs. Americans think it important for young people to decide on their lives by themselves.\nChildren are asked to do some work around their house. And in many families, children are paid for doing some housework so that they learn how to make money for their own use.",
