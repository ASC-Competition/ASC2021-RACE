  "article": "When I walk through the streets, I pass strange rooms where people are doing strange things. Some are biking madly. Others are holding metal bars to keep them from dropping down. Still others are jumping around while someone is shouting at them. It looks like something out of Dante's Inferno (<<>> <<>> ). But what is the most amazing is that people pay for these sufferings!\nThe strange rooms are gyms. It is reported that some 41 million Americans are gym members. 12% of the memberships are born in January, as they are determined to knock off   the holiday fat. Maybe it is good to exercise in the gym. However, should they know they can keep in good shape, spending little money, would they still agree with its necessity?\nAt the age of 23, I joined a gym. I lifted weights twice a week in Muscle's Gym. I paid as little as $200 per year. You can't find such gyms in every city any more. Too often, the gym is fancy   with lots of equipment. If you ask how much it costs to join it, the person at the front desk often won't tell you straight. Instead, he'll let you meet with a fitness consultant  , who will provide you with a great number of reasons and suggestions, such as losing weight and getting healthier, just in order to put pressure on you to spend much money joining the gym and becoming a member there.\nWorking out with the help of equipment at home has problems, too. In the early 2000's, I bought a spinning bike at a cost of $700 for home use. I tried a few times only to find that it brought me a neck problem.\nNow I'm back to my old way. I do Yoga every morning and evening. Total cost: $60 for an exercise mat   . I'm enjoying fitness.",
