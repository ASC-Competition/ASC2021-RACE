  "article": "Change is natural part of language development.The words you like to use are probably a little different from those that your grandparents used when they were young.A study carried out by a British company found that the use of e-mail has had a bad influence on the standard of written English.\n    According to the research,computer users today are too busy to hit the \"shift\" buttons on their keyboards----e-mails are often written in lower case,that is to say, with no capital letters for names or the beginning of sentences. Spelling mistakes are generally accepted even in formal e-mails.And nouns are often used as verbs (e.g. Please bookmarkthis site. )\n    With the development of the Internet,e-mail and mobile phone messages,a new language has developed within just a few years--we call it Weblish.The latest oxford EnglishDictionary has included many new words showing the changes in our communication culture.\n    While some language experts are concerned about the future of English and want to do something,John Simpson,chief editor of the dictionary says,\"The standards may be different now but it has certainly encouraged writing and communication,which means a faster development of language change.There are a large number of words that either come from the Internet or have been given new meanings by the Internet.\"",
