  "article": "Scientists have created a \" human-like robot\" that can dance and do the housework.\n\" Mahru\" has been developed to imitate humans and can move its lips, eyebrows and pupils . The machine can also move its upper and lower body freely and automatically stop itself when walking.\nIn addition, it has been programmed to give out two kinds of pleasant smells to match its emotions.\nThe 1.5 tall robot was produced by researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) and is the first South Korean- developed machine of its kind.\n\"'Mahru' will open the way for the commercial use of humanoid robots doing housework,\" You Bum-Jae, leader of the development research team ,said. \"'Mahru' can dance while walking on its legs and is able to work in place of a human.\"\nThrough an advanced motion capture   system, \"Mahru\" can follow a variety of human movements and move its hands freely enough to deal with any obstacles that may get in its way when walking.\nState-funded KIST showed the robot during a presentation at its head office in Seoul.\nPeople here were treated to an entertaining demonstration which saw the robot show off the full range of its skills, most notably s series of dance moves.\nThe research team added that they had designed another \" Mahru\", this time with sensors  allowing it to distinguish  between faces and objects.\nThe showing of \" Mahru\" came a week after researcher in Japan said they had created the \"most human-like\" robot in the world. A team at robotics department of Osaka University in Japan claimed that \" robogirl\", Repliee R-1, \" looks, moves and interacts   like a human, and has silicone  skin that feels almost human to the touch.\"",
