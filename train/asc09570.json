  "article": "Mr. Frank shot well and once he had come in fourth in a competition.\n     Then he went to a big city on business. There he joined the local rifle club. The club had a very good team, which used to take part in a lot of important shooting competitions. One of these took place while Frank was with them. But one of the members of the club's team suddenly fell ill just before the match. The captain had heard of Mr. Frank. He therefore invited Mr. Frank to take the sick man's place.\n    Mr. Frank felt greatly happy to be asked to shoot for such a good team, but he also felt very nervous, because he was afraid of making a fool of himself.\n    In fact, he was so nervous that he could not keep his hands from trembling while he was shooting, with the result that he did very badly in the competition. When he took his score card to his captain, he said:\" After seeing my score, I want to go outside and shoot myself. \" The captain looked at the card for a few seconds and then said, \"Well, you'd better take two bullets with you if you want to do that. \"",
