  "article": "At about 4 am, after hours of being unable to sleep, of shivering in the cold mountain air and trying to silence my crying kids who kept waking up, of attempting to find a comfortable sleeping position, of listening to whether there might have been a bear outside our tent, I finally couldn't stand it any more. I complained, \"Everything has gone wrong.\"\nMy wife and I were in one tent with our two young kids. A hundred yards east away was Summit Lake, where the glorious early morning mist was shimmering off the water. A couple miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet above sea level, and huge snow dotted the scenery even in mid August. Further west still was Bumpass Hell, with steam rising up.\nAs the sun crept up over the edge of the Lassen peak, we fired up the camp stove and had breakfast. Half an hour later, my six-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen peak trail, getting ready to go up the mountainside. We wouldn't make it all the way, but it didn't matter. We would see nature at its extremes: the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it; the blues of the sky shading into the blues of distant lakes, which in turn shaded into the whites and grays of the snow.\nMy daughter grabbed my camera. She wanted to take a photo of \"the composite \"of _ . Looking out over that scenery, and seeing my daughter fascinated by nature, I felt stupid about my morning complaints.\nYes, camping is uncomfortable. And yes, there's a lot to be said for getting out a credit card,reserving a room in a nice hotel, and going out for a fancy meal. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to raw nature. And , as important, there's something vital about getting young children out of their increasingly modern comfort zones and forcing them to meet the world around them.",
