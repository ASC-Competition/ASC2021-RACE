  "article": "Perhaps you have heard a lot about the Internet, but what is it?\nThe Internet is many different networks around the world. A network is a group of computers put together. These networks joined together are called the Internet.\nMaybe that doesn't sound interesting. But when we've joined the Internet. There are lots of things we can do. We can have a lot of interest on the World Wide Web (www). We can use the internet instead of a library to find all kinds of information for our homework.. We can find information about our favorite sports or film stars and do shopping on the Internet. We can also send messages to other people by e-mail. It is much cheaper and quicker than calling our friends or sending letters.\nThanks to the Internet, the world is becoming smaller and smaller. People can now work at home with a computer in front, getting and sending the information they need. They can buy or sell whatever they want by the Internet. But do you know 98%of the information is English? So what will English be like tomorrow?",
