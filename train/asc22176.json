Play your kids' favorite music and let them dance around while they are doing their chores.\nMake it a treasure hunt  : It's a good way when you would like them to clean the house. Let them know that you hide   a $5 bill someplace. If they find it, they can keep it.\nChange often:If your kids keep doing the same chores for months, they may feel bored. Teaching them a new task   is fun for both you and the kids.
