  "article": "Ask any student which subject he or she hates most. 9 out of 10 students will answer \"math\". No matter which country you visit, no matter which grade you are in, you may not learn art, geography, chemistry or Chinese, but you always learn math. Why is this so? How come so many students hate math, and yet cannot avoid learning it in school?\nJenny Sanders, a high school student in California, asks, \"What good do we get from learning math? We can use computers to compute numbers, and we can use computers to store information. I think learning math at school is a waste of time.\"\nHowever, there is much more to math than just learning to add and subtract   numbers. In fact, math is not so much about calculation   as it is about learning to think logically   and solving problems. Of course, Jenny was right that we can use computers to do calculations, but how would we even know how to use the computer if we can't think logically? In short, computers are only tools when solving problems.\nFor example, imagine you are a cook and must serve dinner to 100 guests. How should you divide\nyour resources so that you can get the job done most efficiently  ? In situations like this, the ability to think logically will get you to a reasonable answer and solve your problem.",
