  "article": "I was born with epilepsy, a disease of the nervous system that causes a person to fall unconscious. I first suffered from it at 3.My mother was also born with it, but only ever so often short periods, Elementary and Junior High were not easy for me. I was unable to take part in sports and events like the other students. I was being treated with medicines, as they were trying to find the right ones for me. I was a victim of bullying. and often got off the school bus crying. I had friends and good times, but I was never happy at school. I would rather stay at home and play the piano and read books.\nThe first two years of High School were the worst. I was bullied by girls and guys who didn't want to get to know me. I soon felt like there was something wrong with me. I felt alone, and my relationship with God was falling. Junior year, I took part in volleyball and cheerleading, and was Very 8uccessful in the two. I made t}1ree Very close friends, and I soon started acting like myself.\nSenior year, I was Voted class clown, and I grew so strong and I shared my kindness with all around me, and stood up for what was right.\nWhen l went off to college, I started attending church and my relationship with Cod was close again, like my younger days in Sunday sch001.1 wouldn't go back and change anything. I came to a conclusion. It was my mom who helped me and stood by my side all those years, and it was God who carried me. I am stronger than ever before, and I will never become discouraged about the bullying. I still have my beautiful family, and nothing else will take away those memories. If these difficulties and efforts bring us closer to God, then bring on the rain.",
