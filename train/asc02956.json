  "article": "Sitting for more than three hours a day can decrease a person's life expectancy by two years, even if her or she is physically active and gets rid of  dangerous habit like smoking ,according to a study. Watching TV for more than two hours a day can worsen that problem, decreasing life expectancy by another 1.4 years.\nThe analysis comes just two years after Australian researchers found that people who said they watched TV for more than four hours a day were 46% more likely to die of any cause than people who said they spent less than two hours a day watching TV. Those watching TV more than four hours a day were also 80% more likely to die of cardiovascular   disease. \"Long-sitting behavior is something we need to take note of beyond telling people to get 30 minutes of activity a day ,\" said Peter T. Katzmarzyk, one of the lead researchers. But while the evidence of illnesses is increasing, it remains difficult for many people to find time to get on their feet, especially if they do desk jobs.\n\"Try to stand as much as you can,\" Dr Katzmarzyk said. \"Typically when you are on the telephone you can stand and use the speakerphone. Instead of e-mailing someone in the office, just get up and so to talk to them.\" However , Dr Katzmarzyk added, standing shouldn't be alternative to exercising, but an alternative to sitting . \"Several studies show that when you're sitting , your leg muscles are completely inactive,\" he said . \"When you're sitting and completely inactive, this is when you run into trouble managing blood sugar.\"",
