  "article": "Everyone has a family name. My name is Jane Armstrong. Armstrong is my family name. What does Armstrong mean  ? Does it mean my arms are strong? But I am a slim girl. I don't like strong arms. My best friend is Lucy Long. Is she a long or a tall girl? No, she isn't. She is short. But she has long hair.\nSome family names come from jobs. My cousin's name is James Cook. Does it mean he can cook? No, he can't. And he doesn't like cooking at all. He only likes eating nice food. And he likes the TV show A Bite Of China (<<>> ), because it is all about nice food.\nSome people get family names from places. Ann Hill is my classmate. Is there a hill  near her home? Yes, there is one behind her home. But her uncle, Tom Hill, lives 20 kilometers from a hill.",
