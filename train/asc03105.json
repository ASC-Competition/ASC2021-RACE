  "article": "Even if you are saying and doing the right things at your job and in your personal life, you could be making a bad impression on everyone with what you don't say. That's because much of our reactions to others are based on body language. If your body language is communicating a negative message, that's the message you could be sending, regardless of what actual words come out of your mouth.\nWhat are negative messages sent via body language? Things like having arms folded across your chest can show hostility . Lack of eye contact can indicate shiftiness . An unsmiling face could communicate a variety of things, like anger, disappointment, or sadness, depending upon what other facial expressions are included.\nWant to know what body language communicates? Watch a TV show or a movie with the sound off, and see how much you can figure out of the plot, or at least you can get a sense of what is going on.\nHowever, many of the clues that indicate negativity could also be the result of nervousness or other issues. For example, somebody who doesn't make eye contact could simply be nervous. The same goes with a not-so-warm hand-shake. Or, someone folding his arms could simply be more comfortable with the arms that way, not realizing what the arms' position sends. Someone who doesn't smile could be self-conscious about her teeth. At any rate, the person who sends off bad body language may not even realize that they're doing it.\nUnfortunately, some people who do recognize what body language communicates are scam  artists. They may have the firmest handshake, the shiniest smile, and make the greatest eye contact to convince others of their sincerity, because they know how much this nonverbal communications plays a part in communicating sincerity. Yet people _ it, because their body language seems sincere.\nBut what if you're in the opposite situation? If you're not sure what your body language is communicating, ask a trusted friend for help. You can also concentrate on standing up straight and sitting up straight, if posture  is a problem. Practicing in front of a mirror can help you get rid of bad habits. Remember to smile and nod if needed. And try to learn how to relax. Before you know it, you will be sending more positive messages with your body language.",
