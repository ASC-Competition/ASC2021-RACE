  "article": "A new graph has revealed exactly how long you'11 need to sweat it out in the gym to neutralize   swallowing a favorite fast food.\nWhile eating fried chicken, pizza and burgers will all entail a gym session of over an hour doing cardio or lifting weights, women have it far harder than men and must work extra hard to banish calorie-packed meals.\nAfter a classic McDonald's favorite, the Big Mac, men would need to do 42 minutes of cardio or 57 minutes of weightlifting.\nAs for women, fifty one minutes of cardio would help counter the 24 grams of fat in a Big Mac---over a quarter of the recommended daily allowance - --or an hour and eight minutes of weightlifting.\nHowever, the 450g Tesco chocolate cake was by far the worst offender. Clocking in at a whopping 1,710 calories and 90 grams of fat, only a hardcore gym session is going to shift the calories you've absorbed from this dessert. The average woman would have to lift weights for almost four hours to work off the calories in this cake.\nComparatively a chocolate bar seems healthy, with 237 calories which would take 25 minutes for the average woman to run off. Alternatively you could spend thirty three minutes doing weightlifting exercises.\nMen will have to complete 40 minutes of cardio and 53 minutes of weightlifting while women will have to complete 48 minutes of cardio and 64 minutes of weightlifting against the calories in French fries.",
