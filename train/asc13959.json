  "article": "What time of day can you think most quickly? Are you a morning person? Or does it take you a few hours to get your brain going? A lot of recent research suggests that we should pay attention to our body clock. It can tell us what time of day we can perform best at.\nMany people work best later in the morning. This is because the body's temperature takes time to rise through the day. Taking a warm shower when you wake up can help your body's temperature rise quickly.\nBut everyone's body clock is different and some are special. Morning people will get up early and\nwork better early in the day. Evening people will work later but work better towards the end of the day. Research shows that we're better at some activities at certain times of the day. Physical performance is at its best between 3 pm and 6 pm, so it's better to exercise later in the day.\nBetween noon and 4 pm, people begin to pay less attention. This is because we think less quickly\nafter a big meal. Research also shows we become sleepy around 2 pm. This is why people in Spain take a short sleep in early afternoon.  Finally, it is best to eat when we're active. This allows our body\nto burn calories better and stops our blood sugar levels from getting too high.",
