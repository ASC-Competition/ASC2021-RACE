  "article": "A teenage boy couldn't stand his parents' family rules, so he left home. He wanted to be famous, but he had poor education and several years later, he had to ask for food on the street for a living. Now his mother has died. His father is an old man. But he is still looking for his son. He has been to every corner of the city. Everywhere he goes, he puts up a big photo of himself on the wall. At the lower part of the photo he writes, \"I still love you... ,  come back home !\"\nOne day, the son saw one of the photos. The face was familiar . \"Is that my father?\" He moved closer and read the words: \"I still love you...\" He cried. When he got home, it was early morning. He knocked at the door. The door opened itself. He rushed to his father's bedroom. His father was sleeping. He woke his father up, \"It's me! Your son is back home!\" The father and the son held each other, full of happy tears. The son asked, \"Why is the door not locked? A thief could get in.\" The father answered softly, \"The door has never been locked since you left.\"The door of parents' love for their children will never be closed.",
