  "article": "Scott Langteau has this message for kids:spend less time playing video games.\nIt's a message that many a mom and dad have tried to impress upon many a youngster (and some notsoyoungsters) who spend perhaps a bit too much time with game controllers in hand.\nBut the 40yearold Langteau isn't a parent.He's a veteran   of the video game industry--one who played producer on three \"Medal of Honor\" games and cofounded his own game development company.\nLangteau has just published a children's books called Sofa Boy,which tells the story of a kid who spends too much time sitting on the couch with controller clutched in hand and the rather terrible consequences that follow.\nIt's a fairy tale plucked straight from Langteau's own experiences as a lad with a fondness for video games and his own bouts with a bit of game addiction.But first,Langteau would like to make one thing clear,\"I'm not saying that you shouldn't play video games.I think video games are great.I think they do great things for kids.\"Instead,Langteau says his book is all about a little something called moderation  .\n\"It's about being well rounded,\" he says.\"Just like with anything else,we all need to make sure that there's a variety in what we do.\"\nVideo gamers can be rather badtempered when it comes to accepting criticism about their favorite entertainment.And understandably so.After all,most people who go around talking about the dangers of playing video games tend to be outsiders--people who don't play video games and certainly don't understand that they can be a valuable and healthy form of entertainment.\nBut Langteau and Sofa Boy seem to be in a  unique position to deliver a message of gaming moderation that the young game masses might actually listen to.After all,this is a man who understands what it means to be a kid with a passion for games.His early experience has taught him a lesson.",
