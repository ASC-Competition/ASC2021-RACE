  "article": "\"Success begins with belief and ends with doubt.\"--Larina Kase\nI remember reading through a book and the author was writing about being a reverse paranoid. In that particular section he mentions how he has a belief that the world he's living in is out to give him everything he absolutely wants and desires.\nThere are times when I think to myself,\"Wow,the world is out to get me and make me miserable.\" Then I thought,why can't I believe that the world is out to make me a better conversationalist. Then I started adapting to the belief of the reverse paranoia.\nWhen I started talking to people,I truly believed that I was the most interesting person in the room. I believed that everything I said added value to the conversation. I believed that people stayed behind and chatted with me because they found me _ .\nAs a matter of fact, for about five months I wrote down on my bathroom mirror the following affirmation:\"People love me and respect me. It is a privilege to talk to me. People find me interesting and charming and always want to get to know me better!\"\nI would say the affirmation after I brushed my teeth. And I would continue to say it until I felt completely great about myself. There were days that I just wouldn't feel like saying it,because it would feel like a lie to me. But that's the trouble,like the quote says,success ends when there's doubt. And that's why I continued until I had no doubt in my mind.\nThen strange things happened,I noticed that people did find me more interesting,and that I gained more confidence in talking with people. I was more assertive  at work. I was able to control politics and gossip at work to minimal levels,and became a much better manager,and developed better customer relations to the point that sales were up by 20% compared to the year before,on my best month sales were up by 39%,and this was a year that a recession was happening.",
