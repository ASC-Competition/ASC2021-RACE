  "article": "After serving as a ski guide in Utah's back country for more than two decades, a Park City woman is being recognized by Outside Magazine as 2015's Best Ski Guide.\nDeb Lovci grew up in Colorado and began skiing when she was five years old. Later she moved to Utah and fell in love with the back country of Wasatch Mountains. Lovci has now served as a Ski Utah Interconnect guide for 27 years. \"Anything that you slide on snow, I'm in love with, \" she said.\nLovci leads ski tours through the back country of six different resorts located in the Wasatch Mountains. Lovci typically takes a group of eight to ten people on a ski tour each day, and on average, she takes 300 customers on tours through the back country each season. She loves showing off Utah's wilderness. \"I love the back country,\" she said. \"I love the snow science behind it. I love the safety ... I just love it.\"\nAlong with leading ski tours, Lovci is passionate about anything related to activities. She also runs a bed-and-breakfast in Park City, the Old Town Guest House. As \" _ \", she also runs Alpine skis, Nordic skis competitively, and snowboards, and leads mountain bike tours during the summer.\nOutside Magazine selected five travel guides in various outdoor fields to name as the best in their Best of Travel April issue. Lovci said she was unexpectedly cheerful when she was selected as 2015's Best Ski Guide by Outside Magazine. \"We all work really hard in what we do and we love it and it's really nice to get acknowledged,\" she said. \"I work with a lot of excellent guides and the award could have gone to anybody -- any one of us. I often recall my ski experiences which were fearful at the beginning, but they helped me achieve a success.\"\nIn a news release, Ski Utah director of communications, Paul Marshall said, \"Deb Lovci is one of the most enthusiastic, focused, knowledgeable guides in the industry. Without her as the forefront of our Interconnect Tour, we would not have the success we have. She has been an enthusiastic part of the Interconnect Tour for 27 years and is thought highly of by our customers.\"",
