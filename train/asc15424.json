  "article": "There is a story about a man who lost his legs and left arm in an accident. After the accident, only a finger and thumb on his right hand remained.\nHe was a brilliant, creative, and educated man. He had gained a lot of experience while traveling around the world, so he became very depressed after his accident. He was afraid that he would spend the rest of his life suffering and would no longer be able to spend his life in a meaningful way. Then, he realized that he still had partial function of his right hand and could still write even though it was very difficult. An idea occurred to him. \"Why not write to other people who need encouragement?\"\nHe wrote to the prison ministry about sending letters to the prisoners. The prison minister replied, \"Writing to the prisoners is acceptable, but your letters will not be answered.\"\nFilled with excitement, the man knew he could write his letters. He began sending one-way messages of God's love, hope, strength, and encouragement. He wrote twice a week, testing his strength and ability to the limit. He poured his heart and soul into his words and shared his experience, sense of humor, optimism, and faith.\nIt was difficult to write those letters, especially without hope of a reply. One day he received a letter from the prison ministry. It was a short note from the officer who monitored and checked the prison mail.\nThe letter said, \"Please write on the best paper you can afford. Your letters are passed from cell to cell until they literally fall to pieces!\"\nNo matter what circumstances life may present, we all have unique experiences, abilities, and God-given talents. We can discover ways to reach others who desperately need messages of encouragement and strength.",
