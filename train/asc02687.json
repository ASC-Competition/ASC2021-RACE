  "article": "Failing in something isn't a really nice feeling, but Scotland' s Fettes College in Edinburgh wants to show its students that failure isn't something to fear and is actually something to accept willingly!\nThe boarding school held \"failure week\" to celebrate taking risks and learning from them. Whether in sports or school, children often face lots of pressure to succeed and do well, and the school was becoming concerned.\n\"Young people from all walks of life live in a high-pressure environment where they are trying very hard to achieve a level of perfection,\" said Sue Bruce, head of personal and social education in the school.\n\"This week at Fettes we have been focusing on one of the most misunderstood parts of success: failure. While we are often scared of failure, it is important to learn that it is only through failing, often many times, that we learn how to succeed. All through the week, we have looked at the experiences of some of the most successful inventors, artists and businessmen, who failed hundreds, if not thousands of times on their journey to success,\" read a letter on Fettes College's website.\nTo celebrate failure, students were encouraged to try something they've never done before, like playing an instrument or dancing in front of audiences. A number of students stepped up and tried things that they finally failed in, but they had fun and enjoyed the experience. \"The concert was extremely enjoyable, proving that we should always try not to worry about failure and have a go!\" read another note on the website. Students were also taught about famous people like J.K. Rowling and Richard Branson who failed many times before they finished what they set out to do.\n\"If they let the fear of failure stop them from doing something, they are actually stopping themselves from learning, developing, and potentially succeeding,\"said Bruce.",
