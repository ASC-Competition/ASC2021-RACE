She donated  herhair to a charity   and raised a lot of money.Barrett is a middle school student in Britain. On Nov. 16 at her\nschool's talent contest, Barrett had her hair cut off in front of around 300 students. The hair would be used to make wigs   for children with cancer. She has raised several thousand pounds and the money will help people with breast cancer  .\nBarrett got the idea when she visited her friend's mom with cancer. \"All of her hair had fallen out, and it really made me want to do something,\" Barrett said.\nWhen she found out that the charity Little Princess Trust could make wigs for children with cancer, she decided to donate her own hair, even though she loved it.\n\"I saw how sad it was for my friend's mom to lose her hair. So if my hair can go to help a young child with cancer then it's worth it,\" she said.\nCath Stanton, a teacher, felt proud of the girl. \"She's always been very well groomed  , so for her to cut all her hair off really moves us,\" she said. \"She has done a moving job.\" Many students were moved by her courage and donated money.",
