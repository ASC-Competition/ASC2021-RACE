  "article": "The 18-meter-tall Rubber Duck arrived in Beijing on Friday. It was placed on waters in the International Garden Expo Park, where the Yongding River passes through.\nThe Rubber Duck exhibition was designed by Dutch artist, Florentijn Hofman. It was part of the activities of Beijing Design Week, which ran from September 26 to October 3 in 2013.\nThe Rubber Duck stayed in the park until September 23, then moved to the Summer Palace, a famous Beijing tourist spot, where it was on display until October 26.\nThe duck is made of over 200 pieces of rubber. It was guarded not only by staff, but also by 10 volunteers wearing yellow T-shirts and hats with a rubber duck logo.\nSun Yidong, a volunteer who guided visitors to the duck, said the art brought energy to the traditional Chinese park.\n\"Seeing the giant Rubber Duck makes me feel like I'm a kid again.\" Sun said.\nBecause of the rain on Friday, there were not too many people coming to see it. The Expo workers said they expected more people to come and visit the duck on weekends.\nZhao Yan said she had been following news about the duck since 2007, when the duck began its journey.\n\"I even considered going to Hong Kong to see it. It's great that the duck is in Beijing,\" Zhao said.\nBefore arriving in Beijing, the Rubber Duck traveled to 13 cities in nine countries. \"The aim of the Rubber Duck is simply to bring everyone back to their childhood again,\" said Zeng Hui, a leader of the Beijing Design Week Organizing Committee Office. \"It can be a toy for adults.\"\n,.",
