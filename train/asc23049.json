  "article": "If you are really interested in music festivals, then you have probably heard of the Bestival Music Festival. It takes place every September on the Isle of Wight, the UK. As it is at the end of summer, people think it's their last chance to go to a festival and have fun before going back to boring work.\nThe dream begins as soon as you start traveling to the island. In order to get to the campsite   of the Bestival, you have to take the ferry  . The ferry is full of happy festival lovers who are ready to take part in the fantastic music party. After you arrive at the campsite, you can put your tent up. There people talk with each other openly. They are not that cold like those you meet in your everyday life.\nThe festival lasts for four days. During that time you forget all your worries and problems, just like living in a dream. And it is really hard for you to come back to \"reality\" after that.\nIt seems that it is this kind of music event that makes people gather together. It gives people a real sense of unity. I took part in the Bestival with my friends the year before last. It was so exciting and we all lost ourselves in the beautiful music. We are family sung by Sister Sledge was my favorite. I'm really looking forward to joining in it for a second time.",
