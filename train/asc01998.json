  "article": "Singer-songwriter Tori Kelly is close to a huge breakthrough. Her recent performances on the BET Awards shows have created a sensation in pop music. You couldn't call Kelly an overnight success. Sure she's only 22.\nThe Southern Californian girl first appeared in public on the talent show \"Star Search\" when she was only 10. But her real appearance came from posting videos on YouTube. Eventually Kelly made her way to \"American Idol\", and advanced through to Hollywood. But she did not make the Top 24. That loss encouraged her to write more of her own material, which eventually became part of her first album \"Handmade Songs by Tori Kelly\".\n\"Even just releasing music in general is an achievement. I get to put out a whole album of songs that I just put my whole heart into, and people are responding really well to it,\" she said. \"It's like the best feeling in the world because these are songs about my life. So it's really cool to be able to do what I love.\"\n\"Handmade Songs\" sold well enough to reach the top 10 in a number of music charts .She followed that success with live performances at clubs in Los Angeles. Recently, Kelly excited audiences at the Billboard Music Awards with her performance of her song \"Nobody Love\".\nThe singer-songwriter says that being within reach of her goal is amazing. \"I think all the awards shows I have done so far have just been so _ l,\" she said. \"Like, I always dreamed of being on different awards shows, sitting at home on my sofa and watching. I think as a kid I just always put myself on that stage, and the fact that it's actually happening, that I get to be a part of these shows is unbelievable.\"\nKelly released her full-length album \"Unbreakable Smile\" in June, 2015. Her single \"Should've been us\" is also rising on the Billboard Hot 100.",
