  "article": "In my experience, one of the greatest reasons of unhappiness is the difficulty we have in accepting things as they are.When we see something we don't like, we wish it could be different-we cry out for something better.That may be human nature, or perhaps it's something that has been grown in our culture.\nThe root of the unhappiness isn't that we want things to be different, however, it's that we decided we didn't like it in the first place.We've judged it as bad, rather than saying, \"It's not bad or good, but it just is.\"\nHere is an example.I have written a paper, A Beautiful Method to Find Peace of Mind.Quite a few people think it bad after reading it because I think people should expect things to go differently than you planned, and that you should accept that, instead of encouraging people to change themselves or the environment as much as possible.You could accept it as the way the world works-as the way things actually are.And try to understand why that is, and follow it, as it is.\nThis can be useful to whatever you do: whether it be how other people act at work, how politics works and how depressing the news media can be.Accept these things as they are, and try to understand why they're that way.\nIt'll save you a lot of sadness because you'll no longer say, \"Oh, I wish things didn't go bad!\"\nIf you really understand what I mean, you can try a different way to live in this world:accept, and understand.It might lead to some interesting results.",
