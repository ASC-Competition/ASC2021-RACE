  "article": "The Airport Art Program is proud to have three Youth Art Galleries at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Georgia students, from kindergarten to twelfth grade, are given the chances to have their artwork exhibited to an ever-changing audience in the millions. In return these talented youths provide new artwork every three months to enrich the airport.\nThe first gallery opened in the summer of 1997. In December of 1998 a second gallery opened. Both of these galleries are organized by the Airport Art Program and Georgia Art Education Association(GAEA). The GAEA aims to improve the conditions of teaching art across Georgia. They organize meetings for art students to improve their skills and provide exhibition chances for them to show their artwork. They also hold meetings twice a year for teachers.\nThe third Youth Art Gallery is organized by the Airport Art Program and the Youth Art Connection(YAC)of Atlanta. YAC is a part of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Atlanta. YAC uses the arts as a way to connect with children and teens who don't get enough help or services.
