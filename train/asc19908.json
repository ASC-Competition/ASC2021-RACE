  "article": "I have returned to my hometown after I was away ten years ago. So many things have changed around here. It has become better and better. When I left here, there was a small pool on the right of my house. Now the pool has gone and people have built a large shopping mall  there.\nThe biggest changes have taken place in the center of the city. There are sidewalks on both sides of the street. You can see a street center with so many tall buildings around. You can't drive there any more because no vehicle is allowed to pass there. A European-style fountain  has been built in the street center garden.\nThere used to be an old school near my house. I spent my five years studying there. There was a small payground in front of the school. But now what I can see are five tall buildings standing there. There are two big classroom buildings and a library. A new post office has also been built just across from the new school.",
