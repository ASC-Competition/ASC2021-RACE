  "article": "People were hanging out of their apartment windows screaming down at me,\"Just give up,you fool!  You'll never make it with that little bike.\"I kept telling them repeatedly,\"All I have is this three-wheeled tricycle.\"I kept tipping   to the side,but I kept my balance and ignored the people who were making fun of me.   \nThen at one point a man left his home and ran out into the middle of the street. \"This bike will take forever at the speed you're going!\" He continued screaming words of discouragement right in my face. I replied,\"I must push forward;I must get to the finish line! \"\n   I held on as tightly as possible and rode straight ahead with great determination. I had unshakable faith that I would make it! I also knew it did not matter how long it would take,because I knew it was worth it. At that point,the dream came to an abrupt end\nI got up and remembered the dream very clearly. I also remembered that the night before I was feeling discouraged -- but now I felt happy and peaceful, and my spirit felt alive with hope.  \n   I think we've all been given small tricycles as adults,and we struggle to balance our lives down the dark,narrow streets of mortality  . I now consider the tricycle to be my three wheels of hope. The dream has given me courage and hope that I will finish the race inch by inch. I know I must never give up,but press forward always.",
