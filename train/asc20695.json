  "article": "Wearing the wrong type of glasses will do harm to your eyes. Incorrect glasses may not be good for the children under 10. You may see better with glasses that are specially made for you.\nWatching too much television may be bad for your eyes. This is not true for everyone. People with easily affected eyes may find they get red and achy   from watching TV for long. Carrots will help you see in the dark. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene (b).
