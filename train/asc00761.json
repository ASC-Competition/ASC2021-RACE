  "article": "Life is filled with challenges. As we get older we come to realize that those challenges are the very things that shape us and make us who we are,it is the same with the challenges that come withfriendship.When we are faced with a challenge,we usually have two choices. We can try to beat it off, or we can decide that the thing presenting the challenge isn't worth the trouble and call it quits.Although there are certainly times when calling it quits is the right thing to do,in most cases all that is needed is commitment and communication.\nWhen we are _ to something, it means that no matter how painful or howuncomfortable something is,we will always choose to face it through instead of running away from it.Communication is making a space for discussion and talking about how you feel as opposed to just saying what the other person did wrong. If you can say to a friend,\"I got my feelings hurt.\" rather than\"You hurt my feelings.\"you are going to be able to solve the problem much faster.\nIn dealing with many challenges that friendship will bring to you, try to see them for what they are:small hurdles you need to jump or get through on your way through life.Nothing is so big that it is impossible to get over, and hurt only serves to make us stronger.It is all part of growing up,it happens to everyone,and some day you will look back on all of this and say,\"Hard as it was,it made me who I am today.And that is a good thing.\"",
