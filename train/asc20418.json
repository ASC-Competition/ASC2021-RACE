  "article": "More than anything else in the world, Lion liked being King of the jungle.  He walked around, showing off his power and pride.\nEach day Lion took a long lazy sleep under the shade of his favourite tree.  He always dreamed of weaker animals bowing  before him.\nOne day Mouse ran through the jungle and tripped over Lion's huge paws.  Lion woke up with a start.  \"How dare you wake me up! \"  he shouted angrily.  Lion grabbed Mouse with one paw.  \"On the second thought, I'm in the mood for the snack, and you'll make a delicious meal.\", he said.\nMouse cried out, \"King Lion, please spare  me! If you let me live, I'll always remember your kindness.  And, some day, I might be able to help you.\"\n\" How could such a powerless little mouse ever help me?\" That thought made Lion laugh so much that he decided to let Mouse go.  A week later, Lion was walking through the jungle on the way to his favourite tree when he stepped onto a hunter's net.  The net scooped him up. No matter how he twisted and turned, he couldn't escape.\nWhen Mouse heard Lion's frightened shouts, he raced to help. Mouse quickly chewed through the ropes to make a hole in the net.  Soon, Lion moved out and was free. Lion looked down at the little mouse. \"Thank you for saving my life,\" said Lion, smiling his widest smile.  \"I was mistaken.  You are not a powerless little mouse.  You are a great friend!\"",
