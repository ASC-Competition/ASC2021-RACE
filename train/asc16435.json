  "article": "Mary Cassatt is one of the first great women American painters. At first her father did not want her to become an artist. But she followed her dreams and became an artist.She was born on\nMay 22, 1844, and lived in Europe for several years as a child.\nHer family returned to the United States and, at age 16, Mary attended the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Four years later she decided she couldn't learn anything fresh and practical in Philadelphia, so she returned to Europe. There she studied the skills of the masters in Rome, Seville, Antwerp, and Paris.\nMary received the chance of a lifetime at the age of 33 when the famous French painter, Edgar Degas, asked her to join a group of painters that included now-famous artists like Manet and Renoir. Their style of painting is called Impressionism. They used primary colors and short brush strokes  in their work. They recognized Mary 's spirit and powerful talent and invited her to exhibit in the Impressionist art shows.\nMary painted what she saw: gardens, and paintings of persons , especially of mothers and children involved in everyday living. One of her paintings, \"Young Mother and Two Children,\" was given to the White House in 1954 where it hangs today.\nMary never married and, in 1877, her parents and sister moved to Europe to join her. Mary devoted much of her time to them for the next 18 years to their care. Mary painted until 1914 when her failing eyesight made it impossible to continue. She spent the later years of her life in Paris. She died in 1926 at the age of 82. Unfortunately,all her life, she refused to accept students.",
