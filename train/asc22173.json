  "article": "In March 2014, Australia opened junior high education to Chinese students, allowing them to study in Australian schools from the seventh grade.\n\"When more Chinese students are going to study abroad at a younger age, the opening of Australian junior high schools offers Chinese students and their parents one more good choice,\" Tian Litie, director of the Australian Department of Chivast Education International, said at the China International Education Exhibition Tour over the weekend.\nAustralia will see a rise in the number of Chinese junior and senior high school students studying in the country. Tian showed the reasons for it: lower admission   requirements and low-cost education because of a favorable exchange rate  . According to Tian, in public schools in Australia a student should pay A$13,000 to A$15,000 ($10,000 to $12,000) a year.\n\"Now the exchange rate of the Australian dollar to renminbi is below five, which means the cost is lower than that of Chinese students studying at junior and senior high schools in many other hot places, such as Britain and the US,\" said Tian.\nLin Lina from Beijing plans to send her daughter to a senior high school in Australia, was among them.\n\"My daughter is good at English and would like to study abroad early,\" said Lin, whose daughter is now a ninth-grader in Beijing. \"We came for more information after we learned that the environment and education in Australia are good.\"\nEliza Chui, education officer for North Asia at the Australian Consulate-General in Shanghai, said that Australia is attractive not only because it provides an environment for learning English, but also because students are trained to have critical   thinking and be independent.",
