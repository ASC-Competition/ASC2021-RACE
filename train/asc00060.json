  "article": "Your House Will Take Care of You In Old Age\nHave you ever thought what your life would be like in old age?\nEveryone talks about the \"aging\" society with large numbers of elderly people needing home care. Now German researchers have set up a \"smart\"house, programmed to help the elderly live at home with dignity. Scientists at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute say the house combines existing technology with future-oriented technology.\nFor example, the \"smart\"bathroom has a touch screen mirror that can remind people to take their medicine, wash their hands or brush their teeth. The hardware behind Fraunhofer's electronic bathroom is not new, and the software runs on a regular personal computer.\nWhen the medicine cabinet is opened, a display in the middle of the mirror tells the person how many pills to take. The mirror is linked to a care provider, who can remotely check whether a patient at home is actually taking medicine and brushing his or her teeth. As many elderly people have arthritic  conditions that make it difficult to operate water taps, the mirror also has displays that turn the water tap on or off or control the water temperature.\nThe bathroom is only the start. Kitchens, bedrooms and all other parts of the intelligent\"home will become \"user-friendly\"to meet all kinds of individual needs. Sensors in doors, toilets, taps, light switches and carpets detect every activity and record them electronically. Doctors or care staff can see from the computer records what personal hygiene tasks have been completed, how often the elderly person visits the bathroom or uses the toilet. In case of an emergency, the computer automatically alerts the chosen contact person or calls the care center.",
