  "article": "A hoarder is someone who is unable or unwilling to throw items away, and the disposal   of items causes them considerable pain. When people hoard a massive amount of objects, it takes over the inhabitable spaces of their home. As the collection grows, they are unable to do simple , _ activities such as cooking a meal or watch TV. Sometimes the hoarding is so severe that parts of their homes become inaccessible.\nBut among the many problems that such behavior brings about, the most significant are the health risks. Once hallways and windows are blocked, hoarders are at the risk of dying in a fire, since they no longer have a clear path of evacuation . Things that are piled up high can fall on top of the homeowner, or a person trying to climb over a pile of objects can experience a fall. There is also the problem of sanitation . Areas where food can't be properly cleaned begin to attract insects, and bathrooms that are full of many possessions can no longer be washed.\nUnfortunately, the serious effect of the problem can become worse for two reasons. One is that since the behavior progress behind closed doors, people can accumulate collections of objects for years before friends or family members become aware of the problem. A second reason is that hoarders often don't recognize that they have a problem, and will continue to live in denial until they get professional help.\nWhen attempting to make a diagnosis, psychologists don't regard hoarding as a disorder in itself. Instead, it's often seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder  , depression, or anxiety. The mental health community has only recently begun an intensive study of boarding, and more research is needed in order to understand its causes and find effective treatment.",
