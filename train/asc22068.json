When you are in other countries, do you know how to have small talks with people?\nIn England, people like to talk about the weather, because the weather there _ very often. In the morning, it is sunny, but in can be cloudy or rainy in the afternoon. It often rains, but sometimes it's sunny. And the winter isn't very cold and the summer isn't very hot.\nEnglish people are kind of quiet. They don't often talk to others first, but when you ask them about the weather, they are usually happy and want to talk with you, so you can start a small talk by saying, \" It's a fine day, isn't it?\"\nThey also like to talk about their pets, so it's nice to say \"A lovely dog! What's its name?\" to them. But American people like to talk about sports like football and basketball. They also talk about clothes. The weather is a great talk in America, too.\nA good small talk can make you feel great, so when you are in England or America, please follow these rules.",
