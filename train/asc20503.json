  "article": "Lion is a special animal to Chinese people. A couple of stone lions, a male   and a female  , can often be seen in front of the gates of old buildings. The male lion is on the left with his right paw   on a ball, and the female on the right. And her left paw is touching a baby animal.\nThe lion is the king in the animal world because he is powerful. The ball shows the country or the family will be together forever, and the baby animal with the female shows that you will have many children.\nThe stone lions were also used to show the families were powerful. If you had no money or power, you couldn't put the stone lions in front of your houses.\nIt was also popular to make bridges with stone lions. The best known of this is the Lugou Bridge (also as Marco Polo Bridge), built from 1189 to 1192. The stone lions on the bridge are most famous. Maybe there are 485 lions in all, maybe there are 498 or 501. A famous saying is that \"the lions on the Lugou Bridge are uncountable .\"",
