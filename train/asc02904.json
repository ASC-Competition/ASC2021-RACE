  "article": "At primary school in New Zealand, I was introduced to a school savings account run by one of the local banks. When our money box was full, we took it to the bank and watched with pride as our coins flowed across the counter. As a reward,we could choose our next money box from a small variety, and start the whole savings routine again. Every week I watched my parents sort out the housekeeping and \"make ends meet\". Sometimes it was annoying to wait for things we really felt we needed.\nLater, as a university student, I managed on an extremely small student allowance. Students were ignored by banks then, because we were so poor, and there was no way I could have gotten credit, even if I had tried. We collected our allowance three times each year, deposited it to the best advantage and withdrew it little by little to last until the next payout of the allowance.\nWhen our daughter, Sophie, began to walk, we made a purposeful choice to encourage her to use money wisely. We often comment when the TV tells us \"You owe it to yourself to borrow our money\"--to whom do we really owe it? And what would happen if our income were reduced or dried up? Now, as a 12-year-old child, it's almost embarrassing to see her tight \"financial policy\",and wait for the unavoidable holiday sales to buy what she wants.\nI agree that financial education in schools is very important. But the root of the problem lies with us and the way we behave as role models to those who follow.",
