  "article": "LONDON--Manchester is Britain's fattest city, a survey for \"Men's Health\" has found, beating Glasgow for the first time since the magazine started examining the issue three years ago.\nEditor Pete Muir said the survey had looked at a variety of factors  from gym membership to heart disease rates to find the fattest city. \"Manchester has more fast food restaurants than anywhere else in the UK,\" he told Reuters. \"People are taking the easy choice --eating and then just sitting in front of the TV.\"\nManchester's problem is part of a wider trend . On Thursday, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) blamed  a lack of exercise and poor diet for a fifth of adult Britons being obese . \"Obesity is a major risky factor related to heart disease, diabetes and premature death ,\" said an ONS survey. \"None of the 108 young men in the survey reported eating five portions of fruit or vegetables on average each day.\"\nIn Manchester, the head of the city's public health programs said he did not believe that they were necessarily the fattest city, but that they did have problems and were aiming to address them. Social deprivation  was a major factor. \"One of the myths is that the stressed-out  rich businessman is the one who is overweight,\" David Regan told Reuters. \"In fact, it is the poor areas that have the most problems. We aim not to be the fattest but the fittest city but we have a long way to go.\"\nSecond in the survey is Stoke-on-Trent, followed by Liverpool, Swansea and Leicester. Glasgow is sixth.",
