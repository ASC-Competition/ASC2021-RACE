  "article": "After the killer earthquake hit Sichuan Province on May 12, 2008, love and charity  began spreading through China from all over the world. Rebuilding after the quake begins now, and it will last long into the future. First of all, the most important thing is to help the people in the disaster area take care of their mental  health.\nHere are Professor Le's suggestions:\nDos: Do have enough sleep every day.\nDo stay with your family and friends.\nDo treat yourself to healthy food.\nDon'ts: Don't hide your feelings.\nDon't feel shy to talk to others how you feel. Try to get them to understand you and they can help you.\nDon't run away when your relatives talk about their experience during the earthquake.\nDon't force yourself and your family to forget the disaster.\nBut how long will it take to recover psychologically  from the earthquake? \"It depends on the person's character. They have to help themselves, which is more efficient  than passively receiving comfort and sympathy  from others,\" said Professor Le, a member of the Chinese Psychological Society.",
