  "article": "The world is changing so fast that English, perhaps the most worldly of languages, is struggling to keep up.\nLearners in the future are likely to be much younger. Young children are often said to be better at language learning than older learners but they also have special challenges. Young children don't usually have the kind of instrumental motivation and determination for learning English that older learners often have. English lessons must therefore be fun and rewarding.\nThe reasons why people learn English are also changing. Globalization is bringing together more people than ever who speak different languages and who are turning to English as the means of communication. The English learners of the future may be less worried about sounding exactly like a native speaker and more concerned about how to use English effectively in cross-cultural communication. We may be hearing more non-native speakers in dialogues and a wider range of the \"New Englishes\" now used around the world.\nTechnology will allow English to come to you, rather than you having to go to a special place to learn English.\nLearning English has always involved both pain and pleasure, private effort and social activity. Traditional learning provided take-it or leave-it mixes of these as well as of content but in future learners will be able to choose a plan which suits their cultural and psychological dispositions , or their particular needs at that moment. They, rather than their teachers, will decide how, what and when they will learn.\nAbove all, learning English is about communication and an important benefit of learning English is being able to exchange views and make friends with people all over the world. Despite the growing independence of learners, trusted institutions and brand names will remain important.",
