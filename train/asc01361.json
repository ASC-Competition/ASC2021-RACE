I had just turned 30 years old,and I'd been married for a year.I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go to do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most start-ups don'tand I wasn't sure what to expect.MacKenzie told me I should go for it.As a young boy,I'dbeen a garageinventor.I'd always wanted to be all inventor,and she wanted me to follow my passion.\nI was working at a financial firm in New York Citywith a bunch of very smart peopleand Ihad a brilliant boss that I much admired.I went to my boss and toldhim I wanted to start a company selling books on the Internet.He took me on a longwalk in Central Park,listened carefully to me,and finally said,\"That sounds like a really good ides,but it would be an even better idea for someone who didn't already have a good job.\"That 1ogic made some sense to me,and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision.Seenin that light.it really wasa difficult choice,but ultimately,I decided I had to give it a shot.I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. _ \nAfter much consideration,I took the less safe path to follow my passion,and I'm proud ofthat choice.For all ofus,in the end,we are our choice.",
