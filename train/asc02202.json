  "article": "Beauty has always been regarded as something admirable. Almost everyone thinks attractive people are happier and healthier, have better marriages and have more respectable jobs. Personal consultants   give them better advice for finding jobs. Even judges are softer on attractive persons. But in the executive circle  , beauty can become a liability.\nWhile attractiveness is a positive thing for a man's rise, it is harmful to a woman. Handsome male executives were considered as having more honesty than plainer men; effort and ability were thought to be the reasons for their success. Attractive female executives were considered to have less honesty than unattractive ones; their success was attributed not to ability but to factors such as luck. All unattractive women executives were thought to have more honesty and to be more capable than the attractive female executives.\nWhy are attractive woman not thought to be able? An attractive woman is thought to be more feminine   and an attractive man more masculine   than the less attractive ones. Thus, an attractive woman has an advantage in traditionally female jobs, but an attractive woman in a traditionally masculine position appears to lack the \"masculine\" qualities required.\nThis is true even in politics. Anne Bowman recently published a study on the effects of attractiveness on political candidates  . She asked 125 undergraduate students to rank two groups of photographs, one of men and one of women in order of attractiveness. The students were told the photographs were of candidates for political offices. They were asked lo rank them again, in the order they would vote for them.\nThe results showed that attractive males completely defeated unattractive men, but the woman who had been ranked most attractive always received the fewest votes.",
