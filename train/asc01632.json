  "article": "Chinese e-commerce websites fail to pay more attention to older consumers, says a news report.\nThere's been a thought that younger consumers have been the driving force of online buying. That may not be the case. According to a statement from Alipay, the average expenditure   of Alipay users born before the 1960s was 31,000 yuan in 2012, much higher than 14,000 yuan of those born after the 1980s. It shows that online shopping has become a key part of people's daily consumption, for both young and old.\nBesides shopping, people pay bills such as water bill, electricity bill, and credit card repayment online. The middle-aged and senior consumers are also participating in that consumption revolution.\nLiu Chen, 56, said that his online expenditure in 2014 was over 50,000 yuan, about half of the total annual expenditure. He always pays his telephone bill online. Clothes, electrical appliances and kids' snacks are the main items he purchases online.\nLiu's shopping strategy is to find something good online first, then go to shops to check it out, and finally buy it online because it is cheaper. As quality concerns him, Liu only buys items that come with a guarantee.\nStories such as those from Liu are representative of millions of middle-aged and older Chinese, which show the great potential of the aged in the Chinese consumption market. Yet, the market seems not to be valued as it should be.\nSome Chinese e-commerce websites such as jd. com, dangdang. com and amazon. cn don't have a category for goods for the elderly on their main pages. Alibaba's platform does have one, but the goods in it are not as abundant as other categories. Moreover, Taobao's category is not really designed for elders, but their children.\nDespite the seeming lack of commitment to older consumers, the Chinese market for the elderly is clearly huge, and e-commerce websites should take great efforts to develop it.",
