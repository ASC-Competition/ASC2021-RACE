He often said, \"If I have enough gold, I will be the happiest man in the world.\"\nOne day when he was traveling in the desert , the old man lost his way. He was very hungry and thirsty, but there were only rocks and sand around him. Just then, he found a bag lying on the sand. He hoped he would find water and food in it.
