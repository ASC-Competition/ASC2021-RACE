  "article": "MONTREAL--He may be the world's richest man, but that didn't prevent Bill Gates from falling for an April Fool's day joke by two Quebec radio comics   pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.\nMontreal French-language station CKMF--FM said last Wednesday that staffers   Marcantoine Audet and Sebastien Trudel had a 10-minute telephone chat with Microsoft Corp boss Gates on April 1.\nThe broadcast was aired on their nightly show last Tuesday and repeated last Wednesday.\n\"We were happy. We had been calling Microsoft persistently   for four weeks,\" Trudel said.\nTrudel said he and his colleague had already fooled Canadian pop singer Celine Dion and Formula One   driver Jacques Villeneuve on their show.\n\"This time, we wanted to give ourselves a challenge with somebody more difficult to reach,\" Ttudel said.\nHe said he was surprised that Gates's assistants did not check to see if it was really the prime minister's office on the line.\nTrudel said they imitated   Chretien's heavily accented English, talking about the economy, asking about Microsoft's Windows operating system and inviting the multibillionaire to visit a well-known Montreal strip joint  .\nThe radio host said that Gates was not amused by the fake interview.\n\"He did not seem angry but he did not find it so funny,\" the comic said.",
