  "article": "New rules and behavior standards for the middle school students came out. Middle schools are going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The following are some of the new rules.\nYou should not be allowed to dye your hair, smoke or drink. You should not copy others' work in an exam. Don't do it again if you did it!\nGood students love animals and care for other people. Being kind to animals is being kind to ourselves. Be friendly to the people around you. Try to think of others, not only yourself.\nDon't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone.\nLearn to protect yourselves. If you have to go home late, you should let your mother or your father know.\nUse the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for our studies. But some things on the Internet aren't good for teenagers, so try to look at web pages that are good for you.",
