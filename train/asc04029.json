If you are attracted by the beauty of roses and need some tips for growing them, read on for some tips about taking care of rose plants.\n* You have to buy a good plant, preferably around two years old.\n* While most rose plants can tolerate around six hours of sunlight every day, some varieties need eight hours of sunlight exposure. The shade-loving roses need only four hours of sunlight.\n* You will have to soak  the roots overnight, before planting. If you plant it in a container, then the watering should be done daily, whereas garden roses need water once or twice a week.\n* The next point is the application of fertilizers , which is mainly needed by rose plants in containers. Most of the varieties do not need fertilizers, as they can feed on the nutrients that exist in the soil. There is no need of fertilization during November and December, and the frequency of fertilization can be reduced during the summers, especially after April. It can be restarted in September and has to be increased during the growing periods.\n* Cutting the stems promotes the growth of the plant and also aids flowering. It should be done regularly to remove dead or diseased leaves and stems.\nRose plants can be successfully grown by beginners too! With some care and consideration, all your efforts would definitely be worth it once you smell the fragrance of beautiful roses.",
