  "article": "Janel gave her 13-year-old son Jim an iPhone for Christmas. But she also had a contract  about how Jim's new toy can and can't be used.\nContract\nRule 1: It is my phone. I bought it. I pay for it. I am lending it to you. Aren't I the greatest?\nRule 2: If it rings, answer it. It is a phone. Say \"hello\", use your manners.\nRule 3: Hand the phone to one of your parents at 7:30p.m. every school night & every weekend night at 9:00 p.m.. It will be shut off for the night and turned on again at 7:30a.m..\nRule 4: Turn it off, silence it, put it away in public. Especially in a restaurant, at the movies, or while speaking with another people. You are not a rude person, do not allow the iPhone to change that.\nRule 5: Leave your phone home sometimes and feel safe. It is not all for you. Learn to live without it. Be bigger and more powerful than it.\nRule 6: Don't take too many pictures and videos. There is no need to record everything. They will be _ in your memory for ever.\nRule 7: If it falls into the toilet, breaks on the ground, or lose, you should pay for it. You can take care of the baby, and wash dishes to save some money.\nI hope you can agree to these terms and enjoy your new iPhone.\nMom",
