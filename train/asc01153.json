But a new study shows that India's leading causes of death now also include diseases related to obesity  such as heart disease.\nIndia's National Family Health Survey shows that more than twenty percent of Indians living in cities are overweight or obese. And in the northwestern state of Punjab, that is true for almost forty percent of women.\nAradhna Tripathi is a business professional in New Delhi. She said, \" Eating is the most important thing in any Indian household and how you show your love and gratitude  for a person is through the kind of food you serve him. And the kind of lifestyle we are leading is one of the reasons why we have the number of obese people increasing every day.\nBut Aradhna Tripathi says she has decided to lose weight. Her mother and grandmother are also diabetic . In fact, the International Diabetes Federation says India is now the diabetes capital of the world. Researchers say Indians store more body fat per kilogram than Europeans. That means obese Indians are even more at the risk of diabetes than other people.\nDoctor Anoop Misra at Fortis Hospital in New Delhi says the risk of diabetes is crossing social and economic lines. _ \nBut Doctor Misra is hopeful that the spread (,)of obesity can be slowed. And he says it must start in schools by giving all Indian children the same instruction on physical activity and diet.\nThe World Health Organization says China is also moving up in obesity rates. The estimate   has reached about five percent countryside and as high as twenty percent in some cities.",
