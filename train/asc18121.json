  "article": "Early risers are most likely to be healthy, wealthy and wise, according to the old saying. But those who are early to bed and early to rise do not always have advantages, researchers say. They have found that night owls  are generally brighter and wealthier than those who are able to get up early in the morning.\nExperts from the University of Madrid carried out tests on around 1,000 teenagers and found that those who preferred to stay up late showed the kind of intelligence to find good jobs and earn much money. Larks or \"morning people\", however, often get better exam results, possibly because lessons are held at the wrong time of day for night owls.\nThe researchers examined the habits and body clocks of the young people to determine whether they liked to stay up late and sleep later in the morning, or preferred to go to bed early and were at their best state in the morning.
