  "article": "A man walks into a doctor's office. He has a cucumber up his nose, a carrot in his left ear and a banana in his right ear. \"What's the matter with me?\" he asks the doctor. The doctor replies, \"You're not eating properly.\"\nThis is a popular joke among British schoolchildren. It reflects Britain's famous _ and satirical way of seeing the funny side of life. This unique sense of humor is often cited as one of Britain's defining national characteristics.\n\"The famous British sense of humor has long been our most cherished national characteristic,\" says the British journalist Leo Mckinstry. \"We have valued it above historic military victories and great works of literature, above our rich scenic landscape and our talent for invention.\"\nThe British sense of humor differs from other countries because it is generally more negative. When it comes to making the British laugh, there is nothing more effective than a socially inappropriate joke.\nPopular British comedy shows such as Fawlty Towers, Blackadder and The office are full of sarcasm , teasing and self-deprecation . It reflects the culture where mocking, moaning and ridicule is part of everyday life.\nWhile most Britons don't take these jokes too seriously, foreigners are often puzzled by them. A recent survey found that most foreigners who visited Britain found that the British are \"arrogant, unfriendly and have almost no sense of humor\".\nDo foreigners not understand British humor or are the British just not as funny as they think they are? Mckinstry certainly thinks the British are funny. \"Accusing the British of having no sense of humor is like telling Rolls-Royce that its cars are down-market.\" he says.",
