  "article": "American schools begin in September after a long summer holiday. There are two terms in a school. The first term is from September to January, and the second is from February to June. Most American children begin to go to school when they are five years old. Most children are seventeen or eighteen years old when they finish high school.\nHigh school students study only four or five subjects each term. They usually go to the same class every day, and they have little homework for every class. After class they do many interesting things.\nAfter high school, many students go to college. They can go to a small one or a large one. Many college students work after class to get some money for their studies.",
