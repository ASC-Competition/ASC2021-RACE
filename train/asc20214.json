  "article": "One day, I saw Harry sitting under a tree. He looked very sad. So I asked him what was wrong.\n\"Nothing,\" He said, \"I'm too short to join the school basketball team.\" \"And our P.E .teacher thinks I've little hope to be in the team in half a year,\" he added.\n\"Why not join another team?\" I asked.\n\"But my dream is to be an excellent basketball player in the future,\" he said.\nHe told me his father wanted him to change his idea to join the school ping-pong team.\n\"Good idea.\" I agreed. \"You're sure to be popular, because you have a smart head.\"\nThe next day, he joined the school ping-pong team. He worked harder than any other boy. Soon he was very popular in the team and looked happy every day.\nAt the end of last month, his team took part in the city's high school ping-pong match. He and his team beat the others and won the championship.\nSometimes your dream may not come true. Then make a small change, and it will bring you another success.\n,,.",
