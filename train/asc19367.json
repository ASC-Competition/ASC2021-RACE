  "article": "Put 2 February in your diary! It is World Wetlands Day! It marks the date that the\nConvention  on Wetlands was signed in1971.This special day was first celebrated in 1997 and it is celebrated every year.\nThe celebration is a call for action. It is a way to show people how important and\nuseful the wetlands are for people. On World Wetlands Day, people around the world take\npart in many wetlands activities. People take trips to the local wetlands. There are talks\nabout how important the wetlands are. People get together to clean up their local wetlands\nChildren draw pictures to advertise the day. People also compete in boat races.\nThe World Wetlands Day is important! If there are no wetlands, there will be no water for anyone in the future. Wetlands help protect nature and resources like fresh water. Already,  more than 10000 million people in the world do not have fresh water.\nMany people do not know how important the wetlands are. They can understand why an\nelephant or a tiger is important because they are big, beautiful animals. It is much harder for\nthem to understand how important the animals in the wetlands are. These small animals,\nsuch as frogs and snails, play a very important part in keeping the balance of nature.\nAll plants and animals are part of the food chain .If the small wetlands animals\ndie, some animals in the food chain will have nothing to eat. They will also die. People\nneed the wetlands to keep the balance of nature in the world. If we do not protect nature\ntoday,it will be gone tomorrow.",
