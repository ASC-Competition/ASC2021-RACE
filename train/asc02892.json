  "article": "Is it true that cats have nine lives? One 4-year-old American cat named Sugar definitely seems to have more than one. Sugar fell from the 19th floor of her owner's home in Boston last month and was only hurt a little on her chest.\n\"This story isn't much of a surprise,\" said Jake Socha, a scientist at Virginia Tech University, US, in an interview with the BBC. \"There have been lots of records of these cats surviving.\"\nBack in 1987, scientists studied 132 cats. All of them had been brought to a vet's clinic in New York after falling from tall buildings. Around 90 percent of these cats were alive after their fall and only 37 percent had been seriously injured.\n\"Being able to survive falls is a _ thing for animals that live in trees, and cats are one of them,\" said Socha.\nCats have developed special body structures to survive accidental falls. Their legs are muscular. This can protect their bones from breaking, Professor Andrew Biewener from Harvard University told the BBC. Cats can also spread out their legs like a parachute to reduce their falling speed, he said.\nThe strange part, according to scientists, is that cats have a better chance of survival if they fall from higher than seven stories. This is because cats have a good sense of which way is down. They can twist their bodies as they fall to make sure they land on their feet. A higher fall means more time for the cat to change its body position.\nHowever, you should not throw your cat out of the window to see how this works. Most pet cats are overweight nowadays. They are not fit enough to change their position in midair, warned Steve Dale, an American cat behavior scientist.\n\"This cat (Sugar) was lucky,\" Dale said. In fact, most cats would suffer serious lung damage, a broken leg or a broken jaw or teeth damage, he said.",
