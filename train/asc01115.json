  "article": "As one comes to some crossroads, he or she sees a sign which says that drivers have to stop when they come to the main road ahead. At other crossroads, drivers have to go slow, but they do not actually have to stop unless, of course, there is something coming along the main road; and at still others, they do not have either to stop or to go slow, because they are themselves on the main road.\nMr. Williams, who was always a very careful driver, was driving home from work one evening when he came to a crossroad. It had a \"SLOW\" sign. He slowed down when he came to the main road, looked both ways to see that nothing was coming, and then drove across without stopping completely.\nAt once he heard a police whistle  , so he pulled into the side of the road and stopped. A policeman walked over to him with a notebook and a pen in his hand and said, \"You didn't stop at that crossing.\"\n\"But the sign there doesn't say 'STOP'.\" answered Mr. Williams, \"It just says 'SLOW', and I did go slow.\"\nThe policeman looked around him, and a look of surprise came over his face. Then he put his notebook and pen away, scratched   his head and said, \"Well,I'm in the wrong street!\"",
