  "article": "Dear Michael,\nI'm very glad to be your pen-friend. My name is Li Tian, and my English name is Leo. I'm from Wuhan. It's in the middle of China. I'm in the Number 3 Middle School. There are 55 students in my class, and 28 are boys. From Monday to Friday, we have Chinese, math, physics and P.E. in the morning. I like Chinese and physics, because they're interesting. I don't like math. It's too boring. At noon, I have to have lunch at school because my home is far from my school. We usually have two classes in the afternoon. After school , I like watching TV and listening to the music. I also like playing football, but not the American football.\nPlease write to me soon.\nYours,\nLeo",
