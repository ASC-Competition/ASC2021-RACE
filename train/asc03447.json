  "article": "Christmas in the United States is traditionally a time of gift-giving and family gatherings.But small towns across the country have their own traditions.\nMiddleburg,a small town in the state of Virginia,is known for its horses.For more than 50 years,Middleburg has organized a yearly Christmas parade .Men and women ride horses through the woods and fields.They follow hunting dogs as they search for a wild fox.But first,these hunters ride in the yearly parade,wearing their bright red hunting clothes and hats.\nJohn Hale,a citizen of Middleburg says many city people visit his town.\"We have a lot of people from an urban area that come to visit,but it incorporates a lot of the o1d traditions.\" The nighttime hay ride is one such tradition.Small groups gather under the moonlight on an open wagon filled with hay.The passengers sing as farm horses pull the wagon slowly across the fields.\nThere are some newer traditions,too.Trey Matheu works at the nearby Salamander Resort.He says a visit to Middleburg is a chance to slow down for a day.He says Middleburg can be a calming,peaceful place without tension.\n\"Middleburg is an opportunity to take a step back,to take a deep breath,and understand that  even though life is moving on at a very fast pace,there's really an opportunity where you're allowed to step off for a little bit.\"\nParade organizers say more than 13,000 people attend even in below-freezing weather. But if you ask,you will hear many different reasons why people come to watch the parade:\n\"I come here because I'm from a small town.  I like how everybody comes together.\"\"I live right down that street;right there.And that's my dog.\"\nMiddleburg looks its best at Christmastime.That may be why so many people return each year.",
