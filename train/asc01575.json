  "article": "Researchers found that compared with teens who spent much of their free time in front of TV sets, those who were physically active often had higher self-respect, better grades and were less likely to have risky behavior like taking drugs, smoking, or drinking.The findings, based on a national survey of nearly 12,000 middle and high school students, were published in a journal.\n\"Across the board, children who engaged in any kind of activity were belier off than kids who watched a lot of TV,\" said study co author professor Penny Gordon Larsen of the University of North Carolina.\nOther studies have linked certain content of television programs, such as violence and sex, to children's behavior.But beyond this issue, Gordon-Larsen said that kids who spend hours watching TV \"miss opportunities\" to develop skills, learn teamwork and have other experiences that their more active peers benefit from.\nThat doesn't mean, however, that kids have to be on the football team. The study found that some activities like skating and skateboarding----which adults sometimes frown upon----were also related to better self respect and less risk taking.\nThat skaters were better behaved than TV watchers might come as a surprise to some adults who consider these teens to be bad, according to Gordon-Larsen.Skateboarding is forbidden in many public areas, and some communities oppose building skating parks.But if kids who like to skate have nowhere to do it, \"it's a shame,\" said Gordon-Larsen.\nNot only should parents encourage their kids to engage iii the physical activities they enjoy, she said, but schools and communities should also do more to create opportunities for children to be active.",
