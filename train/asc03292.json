  "article": "Chicago's children's Hospital is the lucky receiver of a surprise $18million gift from Gladys Holm.She once was a secretary who never earned more than $15000 a year and never married.She lived alone in a small flat in Chicago,and was a volunteer at the Children's Hospital.She was called the \"Teddy Bear lady\" because she brought toy animals to sick children on her regular visits.But Miss Holm,who died in 1996 at the age of  86 ,was also a long-time buyer of stocks .Over the years,she saved money that rose up to $18 million ,which she left to the Children's Hospital .It was the largest single donation in the hospital's 115-year  history.The hospital president,Jan Jennings,was shocked when she heard the news \"when Miss Holm's lawyer called to tell me how much that money was,I asked him to repeat it ,since I was certain I had misheard.\"\nWhy did Gladys Holm fell so strongly about the Children's Hospital? Jennings said the hospital first touched Miss Holm's heart nearly 50 years ago,when doctors there saved the life of her friend's daughter.She never forgot the happiness she felt all those years ago.\nHolm's gift will be devoted to heart disease research.People at the hospital said they regretted that they couldn't thank Miss Holm for the surprising gift.",
