  "article": "A blind boy sat on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet. He _ a sign which said, \"I am blind, please help.\" There were only a few coins in the hat.\nA man was walking by. He took a few coins from his pocket and dropped them into the hat. He then took the sign, turned it around, and wrote some words. He put the sign back so that everyone who walked by would see the new words.\nSoon the hat began to fill up. A lot more people were giving money to the blind boy. That afternoon the man who had changed the sign came to see how things were. The boy recognized his footsteps and asked, \"Were you the one who changed my sign this morning? What did you write?\"\nThe man said, \"I only wrote the truth. I said what you said but in a different way.\"\nWhat he had written was, \"Today is a beautiful day; I can not see it.\"\nOf course both signs told people the boy was blind. But the first sign simply sign the boy was blind. The second sign told people they were so lucky that they were not blind. Should we be surprised that the second sign was more effective  ?",
