  "article": "A cancer-stricken British teenager said on Thursday she had been moved by messages of support from around the world after writing an online \"Bucket List\" of things she wanted to do before dying.\nAlice Pyne, 15, created an Internet blog in which she described her fight against a cancer of the white blood cells. \"I've been fighting cancer for almost four years and now I know that the cancer is gaining on me and it doesn't look like I'm going to win this one,\" she wrote.\nFor her list, at the site www. alicepyne. blogspot. com, she has included making everyone sign up to be a bone marrow donor  , swimming with sharks, meeting boy band Take That and getting a purple iPad computer.\nMessages of support and offers of help quickly flooded her webpage and it became one of the most talked about subjects on Twitter.\n\"Oh dear! And I thought that I was just doing a little blog for a few friends!\" she wrote after her site attracted huge attention. \"Thank you so much for all your lovely messages to me.\"\nAlice, who lives with her family in the northwest English town of Ulverston, said the manager of Take That had arranged for her to see the band after reading her blog. A group of local lawmakers have also made efforts with the Anthony blood cancer charity to encourage people to join its stem cell   projects.",
