  "article": "Jean-Michael Lourdis was a promising young pianist. But when the young man played, it seemed to him, as if his hands were iron. He worried so much about his playing that he became oversensitive   to the comments of his playing. Unfortunately, in those days, a critic  was not considered a critic, unless he found something wrong. This attitude of the critics would often leave the young man ready to give up his dream and return home.\nHe was invited to play in Helsinki. The rich, the famous, the leaders of State were all there. Jean-Michael had one of those days when everything went wrong. That night as he played, he felt as if it were the worst concert of his young life. The next day, in the newspapers, some of the comments were so unkind. The young musician was painful.\nThat day, as he sat in his hotel room in total despair , there came a knocking at his door. He had a visitor.The famous Finnish composer  Jean Sibelius had come by to congratulate the young pianist on his performance. Jean-Michael asked how he thought of that and began to quote some of the newspaper critics. \" Hands of iron. No imagination. Little skill. No joy. Don't you hear what they say?\" he asked.\nJean Sibelius looked at young Jean-Michael and said, \"Remember, son, there is no city in the world where they have erected a statue  for a critic.\"",
