  "article": "When I was walking down the street one day, I found a small bag on the ground. I picked it up and opened it to see if I could find out the owner's name.There was nothing inside it except some dollars and an old photo--- a picture of a woman and a young girl about twelve years old. I put the photo back and took the bag to the police station.Before I left, the policeman wrote down my name and address.He thought the owner might want to thank me.\nThat evening I went to have dinner with my aunt and uncle.They had also asked a young woman to have dinner with us.Her face was familiar, but I couldn't remember where I had seen her.During our talk, the young woman happened to say that she had lost her bag that afternoon.At once I remembered where I had seen her.She was the young girl in the photo, though she was now much older.She was very surprised, of course, when I told her about the bag.\nAfter dinner we went to the police station and she got back her bag.The policeman said to me, \"It's a wonderful thing.You not only found the bag, but also the owner of the bag.\"",
