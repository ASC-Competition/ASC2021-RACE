  "article": "Everyone talks about the weather, but no one does anything about it. It is true. People usually begin their talks with\"Isn't it a nice day?\"\nMany people think they can tell what the weather is going to be like. But they hardly  agree with each other. One man may say,\"Do you see how cloudy it is in the east? It's going to rain tomorrow.\"Another man will say,\"No, it's going to be fine tomorrow.\"\nPeople often look for the weather they want. When a farmer needs water, he looks for\nsomething to tell him it's going to rain; he won't believe anything else. When friends have a travel, they are sure the weather is going to clear up very quickly.\nAlmost everyone listens to what the weatherman says, but he doesn't always tell us what we want, and sometimes he makes mistakes. Still , he probably comes closer to being right than anyone else.",
