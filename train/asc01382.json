  "article": "British people have the worst quality of life in Europe, according to a report which highlights   the long hours, bad weather, low life expectancy and high price of many goods.\nIn a study of ten of the largest European countries, Britain, which was considered a popular country to live in, now comes last followed by Ireland, with France and Spain topping the table.\nThough British families enjoy the highest income in Europe, they still have to fight with a high cost of living, with fuel, food and alcohol all costing more than the European average.\nWith the high price of petrol, the UK is the second most expensive country in Europe. However, diesel   is more expensive in the UK than anywhere else in Europe.\nThe report by the websiteuSwitch analyses 10 European countries against 17 different benchmarks , from the price of gas, electricity, fuel, food and drink to the money each country spends on education, health to working conditions and the weather.\nThe top three countries are France, Spain and Denmark, with Sweden, Ireland and Britain coming eighth, ninth and tenth respectively.\nThe study comes less than a week after the United Nations moved Britain out of the top 20 list of most _ countries to live in for the first time.\nAlthough France and Germany were at the beginning hit hard by the global financial crisis, both have officially got out of the trouble, while Britain has yet to prove this has happened. Later this week, despite   signs of recovery in the housing market and rising sales, unemployment is still expected to have climbed to above 2.5 million for the first time since 1994.",
