  "article": "Today, I will tell you a story about AbdulRahman, a friend of mine, who was the victim of the big name DHL. I am sure that 90% of you have at least heard of it. It is known for being the best company when it comes to shipping. It is thought to be fast ,reliable and safe. \nAbdulRahman's brother bought him a mobile phone while he was in the United Kingdom. He wanted to send it to him here in Kuwait .  AbdulRahman specifically asked him to send it through DHL. He trusted the company that much, as most people do.\nBut in the end, even though the company told him that it would take up to 5 days for the phone to arrive at AbdulRahman's door, he never received it. And after two weeks of him calling them and hearing the same response \"We will investigate the matter, and let you know of our decision by next week. We might pay you back up to 50% of the item's cost.\"\nSo they are not paying him the full price of the thing they have lost, or as we think, they have stolen. We have reason to think that way, because according to the records, the mobile phone went \"missing\" while it was in a \"sorting facility\" of the company.\nLast Tuesday, they stopped telling him \"We are investigating the matter\" and officially said, \"We ended the investigation. Your shipment is missing.\" We are still waiting to hear their \"decision\" about whether they will try to make it up to him, by \"maybe\" paying him up to 50% , and nothing more.",
