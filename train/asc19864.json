After the driver gets off, the bus begins to run down the road, and there are 27 students on the bus.\nLuckily ,the 11-year-old student, David, goes to the driver's seat and begins to drive the school bus. He can't stop the bus, but he drives the bus away from a car. At last, he stops the bus near a shop and everyone is all right.\nA woman worker in the shop sees the whole thing. She says the bus nearly  runs into a river. We do not know how the boy stops the car.\nDavid is very quiet about the accident , but he is a hero. \"If he doesn't drive the bus, all the students will go down into the river with the bus.\" says a teacher in the school.",
