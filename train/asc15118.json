  "article": "One summer I was driving from my hometown of Tahoe City,Calif.,to New Orleans.In the middle of the desert, I came upon a young man standing by the roadside. He had his thumb out and held a gas can in his other hand. I drove right by him.There was a time in the country when you'd be considered a jerk if you passed by somebody in need. Now you are a fool for helping. With gangs, drug addicts, murderers, rapists, thieves lurking everywhere, \"I don't want to get involved\" has become a national motto.\nSeveral states later I was still thinking about the hitchhiker.Leaving him stranded in the desert did not bother me so much.What bothered me was how easily I had reached the decision.I never even lifted my foot off the accelerator.\nDoes anyone stop any more? I wondered.I recalled Blanche DuBois's famous line:\"I have always depended on the kindness of strangers\". Could anyone rely on the kindness of strangers these days? One way to test this would be for a person to journey from coast to coast without any money, relying solely on the goodwill of his fellow Americans.What kind of Americans would he find? Who would feed him, shelter him,carry him down the road?\nThe idea intrigued me.\nThe week I turned 37,I realized that I had never taken a gamble in my life.So I decided to travel from the Pacific to the Atlantic without a penny.It would be a cashless journey through the land of the almighty dollar.I would only accept offers of rides, food and a place to rest my head.My final destination would be Cape Fear in North Carolina,a symbol of all the fears I'd have to conquer during the trip.\nI rose early on September 6, 1994, and headed for the Golden Gate Bridge with a 50pound pack on my back and a  sign displaying my destination to passing vehicles:\"America\".\nFor six weeks I hitched 82 rides and covered 4,223 miles  across 14 states.As I traveled, folks were always warning me  about someplace else.In Montana they told me to watch out for  the cowboys in Wyoming; in Nebraska they said people would not  be as nice in Iowa. Yet I was treated with kindness everywhere I went.I was amazed by people's readiness to help a stranger, even  when it seemed to run contrary to their own best interests.",
