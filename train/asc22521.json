  "article": "Dear William,\nIt's 2:25 am. I can't sleep. There is something that I have to tell you. Our grandfather feels bad and gets very sick. He had a fever for the whole day yesterday. So, Aunt Ruby sent him to the hospital last night. Did your father tell you _ ? Mike and I planned to go to New Town to visit him this weekend. Do you want to go with us? Maybe we can cheer him up.\nGrandpa took care of us when we were little. After grandma died, he spent lots of his time being with us. He helped our parents a lot. He changed diapers   for us, stayed with us when we were sick, and took us to a park every day. He was so nice to us. We have to do something for him now. As we know, _ \nPlease call me when you see this email. I have to buy the train tickets today.\nYours,\nKevin",
