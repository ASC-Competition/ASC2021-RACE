  "article": "Mr. and Mrs. Jackson worked in the same workplace. The man was skillful and could make all kinds of parts and repair the machines. The boss liked him and paid him more than his workmates. But he had to give all his money to his wife and she bought the food, clothes and drinks for him. He was angry with her but couldn't say anything. All the men in the workplace were afraid of their wives and they felt sorry for each other.\nIt was March 8 and all the women had a day off. The men could say all they wanted. They said they had to do all the housework at home but the women always spent much money on their clothes. And they didn't think it was fair that women had their own festival but they didn't. The more they said, the angrier they became. They decided to write a letter to the UN and advised them to rescind the\" Women's Day\". And they asked Mr. Jackson to do it. The man agreed and began to write it at a table.\nJust at that moment when Mr. Jackson finished it, his wife came in. She had left her key in the workplace and came to look for it. The man hurried to hide the letter. But it was too late. She made him hand it to her. Having read it, the woman returned the letter to him and said with a smile, \"How can you post it to the UN if I don't supply you the money for buying a stamp?\"",
