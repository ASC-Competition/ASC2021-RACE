When they went into the playground, the children came up.\n\"What a funny old man,\" the boy said, making a face.\n\"Hey, fatty ,\"another one shouted.\nThe children _ the pair(,) and jumped up and down.\nWithout saying a word, the old man took his grandson  out of the school gate.\n\"Wonderful! I don't have to go to school!\" the boy said.\n\"You do, but not this one,\" his grandfather said. \"I'll find you another school to go to.\" Grandfather took his grandson back to his house, asked Grandmother to look after him, and then went out to look for a school alone.\nEvery time he got to a school, the old man went into the playground, and waited for the children to come out at break time. In some schools the children completely ignored the old man, and in others, they made fun of him. When this happened, he would turn sadly and leave. Finally, he went into the very small playground of a very small school, and stood tiredly against the wall. The bell rang, and the children came out into the playground.\n\"Sir, are you all right? Shall I bring you something to drink?\" said a voice.\n\"We've got a bench  in the playground. Come and sit down,\" came another voice.\nSoon a young teacher came out into the playground. The old man greeted him and said, \"Finally, I've found my grandson the best school in town.\"",
