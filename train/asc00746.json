  "article": "HOUSTON (Reuters) -- Houston tops a U.S. magazine's annual fattest cities list for the fourth time in five years, with four other Texas cities in the top 25.\nFast food restaurants -- Houston has twice the national average number -- are partly to blame for the dishonor,Men's Fitnesseditor-in-chief Neal Boulton said.\n\"Americans work long hours, don't take vacations, and when they're faced with the worst food choices, they indulge   in those,\" he said.\nHigh humidity, poor air quality and some of the nation's longest commute   times also helped Texas' most populous city unseat Detroit, the 2003 heavy weight champion, the magazine said.\nHouston Mayor Bill White, who has worked with a major food company to develop healthy food products and the city's public schools to improve lunch menus, called the report \"mostly ungrounded and nonsense.\"\n\"On the other hand, it calls attention to real issues the mayor is trying to deal with,\" his spokesman, Frank Michel, said.\nThe magazine said it looked at factors such as the number and types of restaurants, park space, air quality, weather and the number of health clubs.\nPhiladelphia, Detroit, Memphis, Tennessee, and Chicago followed Houston on the seventh edition of the fat list. Texas cities Dallas, San Antonio, Fort Worth and El Paso were in the top 14, which Boulton said was no surprise.\n\"It's pure big indulgence, just _ , and that's part of the culture,\" said Boulton.\nSeattle ranked as the fittest city. Austin and Arlington, a Dallas-Fort Worth suburb, were the only Texas cities on the fit list. Austin was 19th and Arlington 22nd out of 25.",
