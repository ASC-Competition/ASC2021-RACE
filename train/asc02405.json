  "article": "Does happiness have a scent?\nWhen someone is happy,can you smell it?\nYou can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org.\nFor the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period.\nThose sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents.\nResearchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them.\n\"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey.\nThis is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings.\nResearchers have yet to isolate  exactly what the chemical compound for the happiness smell is,but you might imagine what the potential applications for such a finding could be.Happiness perfumes,for instance,could be invented. Scent therapies could also be developed to help people through depression or anxiety.\nPerhaps the most surprising result of the study,however,is our broadened understanding of how emotions get communicated,and also how our own emotions are potentially managed through our social context and the emotional states of those around us.",
