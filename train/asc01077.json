  "article": "Mr. Jackson was tired of living in his old house in the countryside and wanted to sell it and buy a better one. He tried to sell it for a long time, but was not successful, so at last he decided to go to an estate agent.\nThe agent advertised  the house straight away, and a few days later, the owner saw a very beautiful photograph of his house, with a wonderful description of his garden in an expensive magazine.\nHaving read the advertisement through, the house owner hurried to phone the estate agent, saying, \"I'm sorry, Mr. Jones, but I've decided not to sell my house after all.\" \"Why?\" the agent asked in a surprised voice. \"Because from the advertisement in that magazine I can see it's just the kind of house I've wanted to live in all my life.\"",
