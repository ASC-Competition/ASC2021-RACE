  "article": "There's nothing like having a child to remind you that you are no longer the center of your own universe. But every now and then, I need to relax with some\"me\"time.\nI booked an overnight trip to Dover, Delaware. We arrived in Delaware right after sunset. Mom and I settled into our hotel room and went downstairs to the restaurant, and then I ordered myself a drink. I had just taken two sips when my husband called me.\n\"I'm so sorry to bother you,\"Craig said.\"The baby is burning up and we are on the way to the hospital.\"I didn't know how to reply. I was so desperate to get away to take a break. My baby was sick but I couldn't do a thing for him. The situation made me feel so helpless.\"I don't know what to do,\"I told him.\"I'm five hours from home!\"\"I know,\"my husband said.\"You can't help that. I'll call you when I know what's wrong.\"My husband and my father took the baby to the emergency room. Meanwhile, I searched the restaurant for my mom. Once I found her, we went to our hotel room and waited for a phone call.\nOver an hour later, Craig called to tell me that the baby had bronchitis . He seemed to be feeling better. The next morning, when I returned home, the baby was already back to his happy self.\nEver since this incident, I have really struggled with the concept of\"me\"time. I try to figure out why I need a break from the child who I love very much. However, sometimes I need to feel like a person and not just a mommy machine. In recent months, I have taken some\"me\"time. My mom helped keep the baby so I could go shopping, take a nap, and clean my house. On a couple of occasions, Craig and I went to dinner with friends. And this summer, I even managed to read an entire novel while the baby rested.\nNow I've decided not to leave the baby overnight again or travel a long distance without him. I remember when I first announced my pregnancy , a friend told me there was no 'me' in mommy. Maybe there's not. But for me, I'm taking\"me\"time when I can.",
