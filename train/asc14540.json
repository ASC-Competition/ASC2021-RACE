  "article": "Near the village, there is an old famous temple. Some people want to build new houses where the temple now stands, because they can find no other area to build them, while others disagree with them. They meet to decide how to solve the problem. Here are their opinions about it.\nThe expert wants to protect the temple and believes that there are some interesting things buried in the ground. If it is destroyed or moved, people may never learn about how people lived in the past.\nThe businessman thinks that the houses should be built. History is important, but we must think about the future. The village needs development and building new houses will offer jobs to hundreds of people.\nVillager A says, \"We should build the new houses because we need houses to live in.\"\nVillager B says, \"We should protect the temple because it can attract many tourists to come for a visit. If the temple is destroyed or moved, we will lose a lot of business.\"\nThe village leader thinks that he has a duty to make life better for the villagers. They need jobs and new houses. He also thinks the cultural site   is important and they should be careful with it as well.",
