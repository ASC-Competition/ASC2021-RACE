Two or three minutes after that, he comes out a third time and asks for another ticket. But the girl says to him, \"Why are you buying all these tickets? Are you meeting your friends in the cinema all the time?\" \"No, I'm not doing that.\" Mr. Brad says, \"But a big woman always stops me at the gate of the cinema and she tears  all my tickets.\" The girl has a good laugh and says, \"One ticket is enough.
