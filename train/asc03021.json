  "article": "Given that many people's moods   are regulated by the chemical action of chocolate, it was probably only a matter of time before somebody made the chocolate shop similar to a drugstore of Chinese medicine.Looking like a setting from the film Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, Singapore's Chocolate Research Facility (CRF) has over 100 varieties of chocolates.Its founder is Chris Lee who grew up at his parents' corner store with one hand almost always in the jar of sweets.\nIf the CRF seems to be a smart idea, that's because Lee is not merely a seasoned salesperson but also head of a marketing department that has business relations with big names such as Levi's and Sony.That idea surely results in the imagination at work when it comes to making different flavored   chocolates.\nThe CRF's produce is \"green\", made within the country and divided into 10 lines, with the Alcohol Series being the most popular.The Exotic Series--with Sichuan pepper, red bean   , cheese and other flavors--also does well and is fun to taste.And for _ , who think that they have a better knowledge of chocolate than others, the Connoisseur Series uses cocoa beans from Togo, Cuba, Venezuela, and Ghana, among others.",
