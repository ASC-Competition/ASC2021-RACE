  "article": "There was once a farmer. He lived near a road. It was not a busy road, but from time to time, cars passed the farm.\nNear the farm gate, there was a large hole in the road. This road was always full of water, and the drivers of the cars could not see how deep the hole was. They thought it was not deep.\nThen when they drove into the hole, they could not drive out because it was too deep.\nThe farmer did not spend much time working on his farm. He spent most of it watching the hole.\nWhen a car drove into it, he pulled the car out with his tractor  and the driver gave him a lot of money for doing this.\nOne day, the driver of a car said to him, \"You must make a lot of money by pulling cars out of this hole night and day.\"\n\"Oh, no,\" the farmer said. \"I don't pull cars out of the hole at night. At night I fill  the hole with water.\"",
