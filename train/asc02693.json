  "article": "Once upon a time, two brothers who lived on neighboring farms fell into conflict  . It was the first serious one between them in 40 years of farming peacefully side by side. In the end, they fell apart.\nOne morning, a man with a carpenter's toolbox came for some work.  The elder brother said, \"I just have a job for you. Look at the farm across the creek  . My younger brother lives there. It was he who used his bulldozer   to dig the creek last week to spite   me. So I want you to build me a fence, an 8foothigh fence, in order not to see his place any more.\" The carpenter smiled and said, \"I see. I'll try to do a job that satisfies you.\" Then the elder brother went downtown.\nAt sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide! To his surprise, there was no fence there at all! Instead, there was a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work! He saw his younger brother coming to him with the hands outstretching. The brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hands. They turned to see the carpenter lift his toolbox on his shoulder. \"No, wait! Stay a few days. I've a lot of other work for you,\" said the elder brother. \"I'd love to stay on,\"  the carpenter said, \"but I have so many more bridges to build.\"",
