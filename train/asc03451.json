  "article": "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It is also the most neglect  . Common reasons for not eating breakfast include having no time, not feeling hungry, traditional dislike and dieting.\nBreakfast simply means \"break the fast''. Your body spends at least 6 to 12 hours each night in a fasting state. In the morning your body needs energy for the day's work ahead.\nA good breakfast should provide 1/3 of your total calorie needs for the day. On average, we eat 400 less calories for breakfast than for dinner. If breakfast doesn't appeal   to you in the morning, try eating a lighter dinner earlier in the evening or save half of your dinner for breakfast in the morning.\nIf you still aren't hungry in the morning, start with something small like juice or toast or have a nutritious   mid-morning snack   later when you are hungry.\nSo, you say you are on a diet. Some people fear that eating breakfast will make them hungrier during the day and they will eat more. It is true that eating breakfast is likely to make you feel hungry throughout the day. That is because your body is working correctly. Although you may feel as if you are eating more all day long, in reality you are probably not.\nNot eating breakfast can also cause you overeat, since a fall in blood sugar often makes you feel very hungry later. To make matters worse, since your body is in a slow state, it will not be able to burn those extra calories very efficiently  . If you feed your body healthy snacks and meals throughout the day, you are less likely to become hungry and stuff   yourself as soon as you begin to eat.\nSince breakfast is the first and most important meal of the day, choosing the right food is important. The best breakfast foods are fruits, juice, lean meat and grain products such as bread, rice, noodles and cereals.",
