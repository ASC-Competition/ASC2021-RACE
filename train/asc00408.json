  "article": "It's 10:30 p.m., and 11-year-old Brandon Blanco is sound asleep at home. Suddenly, a loud noise wakes him up. Naturally, Brandon reaches for his cell phone. He blinks twice, and the message on the screen becomes clear: \"R U awake?\"\nBut the late-night text does not annoy Brandon. He gets frequent messages and calls, even after bedtime. And he can't imagine life without them. \"If I didn't have a cell phone, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friends or family as often,\" he told the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nBrandon's use of technology doesn't stop there. He also has a computer, a TV and three video-game consoles in his room. With so many devices, it is no surprise that when he is not at school, he spends nearly every waking minute using one or more of these devices.   Brandon is hardly alone. According to a recent study by TFK, kids aged 8 to 18 are spending more time than ever before using electronic devices. How much time? More than seven and a half hours a day on average, the study found. That's about an hour more than just five years ago.\nThe jump is the result of a huge explosion in mobile devices, says Victoria Rideout, the lead author of the study. \"These devices have opened up many more opportunities for young people to use media, whether it's on the bus, on the way to school or waiting in line at the pizza parlor,\" says Rideout.\nOften, kids multitask, or use more than one device at a time. \"If you've got a chance to do something on your computer and take a phone call and have the TV on in the background, why not?\" Media expert Cheryl Olson says. Most experts agree technology has much to offer kids. But some worry the kids could be missing out on other activities like playing outside or hanging out with friends. \"It's a matter of balance,\" says Olson.\nMultitasking while doing homework is another concern. Some kids listen to music, watch TV or use the phone while doing their homework. \"It's important to make sure that you can stop and concentrate on one thing deeply,\" says Rideout.\nWith new and exciting devices hitting stores every year, keeping technology use _ is more important than ever. \"Kids should try,\" adds Rideout. \"But parents might have to step in sometimes.\"",
