  "article": "Do you want to know about my staying in America? It was really an eye-opening experience. In China, I had English classes five times a week. However, I didn't know how different textbook English was from daily English until I went to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say \"I'm fine\" when people say \"How are you?\" But in America, I found that people said \"I'm good\" or \"I'm tired.\" One day, someone greeted me with \"What's up?\" It made me _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.\nTo my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun. However, in China, girls try every possible way to get their skin whiter. I'm also surprised by how hard-working American students are. In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard. But in America, a good student gets good grades, does a lot for the public and plays sports or music.",
