  "article": "Students learn many subjects at school, like Chinese, English, math and physics. Some students think it's hard to do well in math. They say it's boring. Why do they say this? First, some math problems are so hard for them. They spend a lot of time on them, but they can't work them out, so they lost heart . Second, they are afraid( ) to ask their teachers for help. They think the teachers will laugh at them. Third, they think math class is very tiring because they need to use their brain to find out the answers all the time.\nHow can you do well in math? Here is some advice from a math teacher:\n1. Listen to the teacher carefully in class and do some extra  exercises after class.\n2. Ask the teacher for help if you don't understand anything. Don't be afraid.\n3. Don't forget to go over   your old lessons.\nIf you do these things, you will find it much easier to do better in math.",
