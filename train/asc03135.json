  "article": "When early colonial settlers went to America, they took many forms of dance to _ . Square dancing, one of the oldest forms of American folk dancing, developed from several different Old World group dances, mainly English country dances, and the French quadrille .\nIn the American version of square dancing, four couples form a square and dance to music. An American addition to square dancing is the caller. What do you think a caller does?\nThe callers---someone who calls out the dance steps in time to the music--- was a completely American invention. At first dancers memorized all the steps for a particular dance, but eventually the dances became so complicated that it was necessary to have someone call out cues   so that dancers didn't have to remember so many steps. The caller didn't just call out \"do-se-do your partner\"; a good caller also came up with colorful sayings or witty lines that he said in between the cues such as \"Don't be shy and don't be afraid. Swing on the corner in a waltz promenade  .\" A caller might also come up with new dance steps and routines.\nAlthough popular for years, square dancing seemed to be going out of style and fading away until the early 1930s, when Henry Ford helped revive interest in it. Ford, the automobile manufacturer, used to vacation at the Wayside Inn in Massachusetts, where he enjoyed the dance programme run by a man named Benjamin Lovett. Ford asked Lovett to come to Detroit and teach dances, but Lovett said he couldn't because he had a contract with the inn. Ford solved that problem by buying the inn and Lovett's contract. He took Lovett back to Detroit, where together they established a programme for teaching squares and rounds. Square dancing was updated and groups began forming all over the country.",
