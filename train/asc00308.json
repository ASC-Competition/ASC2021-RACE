This Saturday, Sept. 25, hundreds of U.S. museums are admission free for the Smithsonian's yearly Museum Day.\nUnlike previous Museum Day celebrations, you must sign up for a free ticket that admits two people to any of the participating museums. That means filling out a form and having the ticket emailed to you. Not bad for a free offer that will give you admission to museums such as the Adler Planetarium in Chicago and the Air & Space Museum in San Diego.\nFree Books for Kids @ Barnes & Noble!\nIf your kids love to read -- and we hope they do! -- be sure to sign them up for Barnes & Noble's summer reading programs so they can earn a free book!\nIt's easy for kids ages 12 and under to participate. For Barnes & Noble's Passport to Summer Reading program, just download and print out your passport. Read any eight books, make a list of them on the back of the passport and bring it to any Barnes & Noble by September 7. Choose your free book from the list.\nFREE Night of Theater Across the U.S. in October\nIt's the yearly run of the Free Night of Theater, when hundreds of theaters in 120 U.S. cities give away thousands of tickets to local productions.\nWhile the kickoff date is October 15, many of the theaters start releasing their free tickets by Oct.1 or in waves during the month of October for performance dates throughout the month.
