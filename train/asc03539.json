  "article": "Cats and dogs aren't usually friendly but they can work together well when there's a common goal.\nMatt Hirst's pets were recently caught on camera conspiring to open the kitchen door while the master was away.\nAccording to his post on Reddit, Hirst -- who lives in the U.K. -- had been arriving home all week to notice one of the doors open, even though he knew he shut it before he left. After the fourth time the door was open he decided to set up a hidden camera.\n\"The first time, I assumed I just must have left the door open. The second time, I checked the whole house thinking that someone was breaking in (and began to suspect the cat). The third time I figured it must be the cat, and decided to catch him out, so set the camera up and left it going all day,\" he wrote.\nJust three hours after leaving the house, the cat jumps up onto a scratch tower and starts pawing at the door.\nIt takes the cat just over a minute to finally break through and then both cat and dog escape to the other side.",
