  "article": "For some reason Dodger did not want to enter London during daylight, so it was nearly eleven o'clock at night when they got near the centre. Oliver had never seen a dirtier or more miserable place. The streets in this district were narrow and muddy, and there were terrible smells everywhere. Children wandered around even at this time of night, in and out of the many shops, playing and screaming. The pubs were full of people fighting, and big, evil-looking men stood in the doorways or at dark corners. Oliver almost wanted to run away, but just then Dodger pushed open a door and pulled Oliver into a dark hall.\n\"Who's there?\" a voice cried out.\n\"It's me,\" said Dodger. The faint light of a candle appeared in the hall.\n\"Who's the other one?\"\n\"A new friend.\"\nThey went up some dark and broken stairs. Oliver could hardly see where he was going, but Dodger seemed to know the way, and helped Oliver up. They entered a room with walls that were black with age and dirt. In front of the fire was a table with a candle stuck into a bottle of beer, and an old man, with a horribly ugly face and red hair, stood next to the fire cooking. He was wearing a dirty old coat and seemed to divide his attention between his cooking and a number of silk handkerchiefs, which were hanging near the fire. There were several rough beds in the room. Four or five boys, about the same age as Dodger, sat round the table, smoking and drinking like middle-aged men. They all looked up when Dodger and Oliver entered.\n\"This is him, Fagin,\" Dodger said to the old man. \"My friend Oliver Twist.\"\nFagin smiled and shook Oliver's hand. Then all the young gentlemen came up to him and shook both his hands very hard, especially the hand which held his few possessions. One of the boys was particularly kind. He even put his hands in Oliver's pockets so that Oliver would not have to empty them himself when he went to bed. The boys would probably have been even more helpful, but Fagin hit them on their heads and shoulders until they left Oliver alone.\n\"We're very glad to see you, Oliver,\" said Fagin. \"I see you're staring at the handkerchiefs, my dear. Aren't there a lot? We've just taken them all out to wash them, that's all! Ha! Ha! Ha!\"\nThis seemed to be a joke, as the old gentleman and all his young friends gave loud shouts of laughter. Then supper began. Oliver ate his share of the food and was then given a glass of gin-and-water. Fagin told him to drink it fast. Immediately afterwards, Oliver felt himself lifted onto one of the beds and he sank into a deep sleep.",
