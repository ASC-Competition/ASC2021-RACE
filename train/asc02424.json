  "article": "Selena Gomez and I are scheduled to meet at a lowkey coffee shop in Encino. Not wanting to keep the superstar waiting, I arrived at nine, 20 minutes early. As I was catching up on emails, Selena quietly scooted into the seat next to me. No bodyguard. Not even a drop of makeup. She was ten minutes early and no one else in the restaurant looked up so much. Selena was wearing Bebe shorts. She had a baby face and ordered a hot chocolate.\nAfter making small talk about what she wore for the shoot, she dived into the subject of her career. Selena declared 2012 the year of movies. She filmed three: Spring Breakers, a drama; The Getaway, an action flick; and Hotel Transylvania, a comedy. Each is a marked move away from the teen style that made her a household name.\nNow that her Disney days are behind her, Selena is at that unstable point in a child star's career where she is trying to grow up--both as a person(she turned 20 in July)and as an artist. \"Being part of the Disney Channel was such a blessing, and I'm super happy with what my show accomplished, but acting is something I would like to take on more seriously.\" She continued, \"I don't necessarily feel accomplished. I want to create a whole different person when it comes to acting.\"\nSelena has been working fulltime since she was seven years old and scored a role on Barney&Friends. In 2007, when she was offered the lead in Wizards of Waverly Place, Selena, her mother, and her stepfather _ from Texas to LA , where they are settling now.",
