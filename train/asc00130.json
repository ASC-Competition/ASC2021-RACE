  "article": "ON a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your pain?\nBaymax, the plus-sized white robot, asks the question each time he detects   his patient's pain. Considering that he is hardly like a typical Marvel superhero, how could this robotic caregiver from Big Hero 6 have stolen viewers' hearts and taken home this year's best animation Oscar?\nSet in fictional San Fransokyo, the film follows Hiro, a 14-year-old robotics genius  . After his brother dies, he goes on a journey to save his city from an evil masked man with his brother's invention, Baymax.\nBaymax was named \"Disney's most straightforwardly adorable   character\" in years by The Telegraph. He has a pure white pear-shaped body and stumpy elephant legs. And his eyes -just two black dots with a line through them - can blink   quickly or slowly. Baymax's physical appearance \"works with his personality because he's purely good and naive  ,\" co-director Don Hall told The Hollywood Reporter.\nSometimes Baymax is awkward. Moving in tight spaces gets challenging with his potbelly  . And when his batteries run low, he behaves like an amusing drunk. \"This means that he is not at all intimidating   and is easy to like,\" commented The Straits Times in Singapore.\nBaymax is a comforting friend, the kind that perhaps everyone needs.\nAfter he diagnoses   Hiro with feeling sorrow, he says: \"Physical comfort helps too,\" and pulls Hiro into a hug. He pats his head, saying: \"There, there.\"\nThe team's car crashes into the water at one point, and they have to walk shivering   back home. Baymax notices that everyone's body temperatures are low, so he turns on his internal heaters. Everyone cuddles   up with him. \"This is like spooning   with a warm marshmallow  ,\" says Fred, one of the characters.\nOne minute, he is used as a bouncy castle  , and the next he transforms into a superhero.\nTo fight against the villain, Hiro upgrades Baymax so that the robot can attack and fly. The robot has a hard time figuring out these new skills, but after he realizes that Hiro is happy with his improvement, he immediately becomes an expert. \"The treatment is working,\"he says.\nTencent Entertainment calls the amazing Baymax a \"perfect companion\".\"He is quiet, clumsy, and adorable. But at important times, he steps up and stops at nothing to protect his friends from harm, even if it means that he has to sacrifice his life. This is an idealized   relationship in harsh reality,\" the site commented.",
