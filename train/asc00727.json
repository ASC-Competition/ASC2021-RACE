  "article": "Knowing the best way to study will help you to be a best student.By using your time properly,you can do your homework more quickly. Learning to study is not difficult.\nThe first thing to remember is that you must be willing to learn.It doesn't mean that you must always like the subject.It does mean,however,that you must be willing to do whatever is necessary to learn. Try to understand why it is important and how it will help you now and later to do and learn other things.Knowing mathematics facts will be useful in your whole life. Knowing how to spell makes any kind of writing easier.Sometimes,the subject that you think is going to be uninteresting will be exciting when you begin to work at it and understand it more clearly. Learning things can be fun if you are willing to work with them.\nHere is some advice for you: have a certain time each day and a quiet place with good lighting for study,so that you can concentrate on your study without interruptions; have everything ready before you sit down to study, a dictionary,paper,a pen and books; be sure you understand what you should learn before you start; read carefully and pay special attention to the most important things; when memorizing,first find out the main parts and recite the whole thing, check your homework after you finish it; never forget the importance of review and preview.\nDon't try to spend a lot of time researching learning methods.There are many students who know many good learning methods but don't study well. They forget that the most important useful learning method is to study hard.",
