  "article": "Time for Kids (TFK) gets the great news on the coolest toys for 2014 at the 111th American International Toy Fair.\nWhat's four days long, bigger than seven football fields, and filled with thousands of toys? It's Toy Fair 2014!\nEach year, hundreds of toy companies from across the country come together in New York City. All kinds of products are shown as a way to know what's to come in the new year. This year's trends   include oversize toys. \"In 2014, everything is really big and really out there,\" says Adrienne Appell, a toy-trends expert.\nToy Fair is the largest toy trade show in the Western Hemisphere  . Toy-store buyers go to the event to decide which toys they may want to sell during the holiday season. Members of the media, like TFK, go to the fair to report back on all the cool trends. Unfortunately, Toy Fair is not open to the public.\nThis year's Toy Fair was the biggest in its 111-year history. More than 1,000 toy companies showed products from simple card games to high-tech robots. \"Larger Than Life\" was a Toy Fair favorite. This trend is all about big toys with a big play value.\nThough it is all fun and games at Toy Fair, we saw lots of products making a push towards education, with STEAM. That stands for science, technology, engineering, art, and math. This trend includes word games. And of course, we saw some super cool, high-tech games. \"Technology is always going to influence toys,\" says Appell. \"This year we saw lots of 3D games, and robots.\"[:ZXXK]\nTo know more information about the event, click   here to watch the video.",
