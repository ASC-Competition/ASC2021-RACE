Unfortunately, I waited until the last minute to sign up. Many of the activities were already full, but I made a decision to join the Cooking Club because at least that way I would get a snack to eat.\nTuesday, April 7\nIt was the first time to be here. Like many of my ideas, joining the Cooking Club made sense at first but was turning out to be a disaster. Most people have been in the club for more than a year, so they already know what they're doing. And since they all know each other, they weren't exactly interested in a newcomer.\nThursday, April 9\nWhat a terrible day!

So I don't think my question about whether vegetarians  can eat chocolate mousse was really that silly.\nMonday, April 13\nOne of my bright ideas worked out for a change! Everyone laughed when I handed out the chocolate \"moose\" cookie that I made yesterday, but this time I was laughing, too. The peanut butter antlers  were a _ . We're even planning to bake more cookies for the school food festival next week.",
