  "article": "At midnight Mr. King coughed again. He got up and took some medicine. Before he lay down again, he smoked. And he couldn't go to sleep any longer. He found the medicine book and began to read it. He was afraid he had lung cancer. He seemed to see death was waiting for him. Tears  ran down his face. He didn't see his wife was standing by him.\n\"What's wrong with you, dear?\" asked the woman.\n\"Nothing,\" the old man answered and covered his face with his hands.\nThe old woman opened the book and understood at once. She said, \"You must stop smoking right now.\"\n\"I began to smoke when I was nine, you know. How can't I do that?\"\n\"But I think health is more important.\"\nMr. King coughed again and his wife said, \"Go to see a doctor tomorrow. He will be able to help you, I think.\"\nThe doctor told Mr. King to have an Xray examination of his lungs. And then he looked at the Xray carefully for a long time.\n\"Tell me the truth, doctor.\"said Mr.King, \"Do you see any shadows in my lungs?\"\n\"No, I don't see anything.\"\n\"Yes?\" the old man said happily. \"Really?\"\n\"Yes. Your lungs are turning black. How can I see any shadows?\"",
