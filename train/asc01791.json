  "article": "If you're making the film with other people, organize your cast and crew effectively. Make sure everybody knows their roles and what day and times they're needed.\nGive people specific jobs so they can become experts in their field. For example, a soundrecordist listens to the sound through headphones as it's being recorded, and holds an extra microphone if needed.\nA camera operator frames the picture , sets focus, checks the light and records the action. The editor \"cuts\" the picture together after it's shot.\nA producer is the contact point for the film. He or she makes sure crew and cast are there on time, talks to the press and organizes the budget.\nA director has to make sure their vision is communicated. To do this everyone needs to be clear about what the director expects from each scene and each shot.\nYou may also need a make-up-artist, a choreographer, a driver, etc. However, you can quite easily make your first film on your own. Make a schedule that says which shots are to be taken where and when (this is called a shooting schedule) and when you've completed a take, cross it off the list. Remember that you may want to shoot \"out of sequence\", e.g. shoot the last scene first, and the first last. Similarly if the film begins and ends by a tree in the park, it may make sense to film both scenes while you're there.\nIf you're making animation  , have a space that you can control. You may need extra lights and you may need to leave work in progress. Make sure people living with you are aware what's happening. Animation needs a lot of undisturbed concentration and patience. Keep at it and it'll pay off. Aardman and Disney both started off at home experimenting with clay , pens and a camera.",
