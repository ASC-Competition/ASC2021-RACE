  "article": "In England,factory holidays come mostly in the period between mid-July and mid-August. State schools usually only have six weeks off, from about mid-July to the end of August.\nThe coast is the most popular place for the English people to spend their holidays, but there are few seaside hotels. Food in British hotels and restaurants is cheap, but rooms are not. Few English people rent  houses for their holidays, but one of their traditional ways of spending a summer is in a boardinghouse . Some boardinghouse keepers give all meals to their guests, others provide breakfast only.\nThe British may refuse to change the times at which they take their holidays, but they have shown themselves very ready to go to new places. Every year, more Englishmen, women and children go to some parts of Europe. Many take their cars, crossing the channel by ship. When they get home again, they always talk about how they spend their holidays.",
