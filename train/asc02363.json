  "article": "Some people were killed when a huge explosion hit an industrial area of China, injuring hundreds of people. The explosion is believed to have come from a shipment of explosive inside a warehouse at about 11:30 pm local time (5:30pm in Britain) in the north-eastern city of Tianjin.\nVideos of the accident showed fires lighting up the night sky, raising dust dozens of feet into the air, and people nearby said the explosion had broken windows. Tianjin resident Zhang Siyu, who lives several miles away from the accident site, said, \"I thought it was an earthquake, so I rushed downstairs without my shoes on. Only once I was outside did I realize it was an explosion. There was the huge fireball in the sky with thick clouds. Everybody could see it.\"\nPost on Chinese social network Weibo showed a fireball shooting into the air and as least two separate explosions, while photos showed people in the street apparently covered in blood. Others image showed children being carried in blankets to safety.\nIt was reported that the two explosions happened within 30 seconds of each other and about 100 fire trucks were sent to the scene, with most of the injuries caused by broken glass and stones. The firm running the warehouse was named by local media as Ruihai Logistics. The company says on its website that it was set up in 2011. It says it handles one million tons of cargos  per year.\nThe National Earthquake Bureau reported two major explosion before midnight local time---the first with an amount of 3 tons of TNT , and the second with an amount of 21 tons. Six thousand firefighters brought the terrible fire under control, although it was still buring . It was reported that the firefighters were combing  the neighborhood for the possible injured.",
