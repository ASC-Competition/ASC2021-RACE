  "article": "A new supermarket put on a notice inside the entrance. It said, \"Remember, once a week, one of our customers  gets free goods(things that cost nothing). This may be your lucky day!\" All the housewives who went to the supermarket had one great hope: to be the lucky customer who didn't have to pay for her shopping.\nFor several weeks Mrs. Blake hoped to be the lucky customer. Unlike many other customers, she never gave up hope. The cupboards in her kitchen were full of things she did not need. She dreamed of the day, when the manager of the supermarket would come and say to her, \"Madam, this is your lucky day and everything in your basket is free.\"\nOne Friday morning, after she finished her shopping and had taken all the things to her car, she found that she had forgotten to buy tea. She went to the supermarket, got the tea and went towards the check-out. As she did so, she saw the manager of the supermarket come to her. \"Madam,\" he said, \"congratulations! You are our lucky customer and everything in your basket is free!\"",
