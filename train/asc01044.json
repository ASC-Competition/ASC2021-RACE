  "article": "Crosstalk ,a traditional form of comic storytelling,is making a comeback in China's tea houses and theaters.\nAudiences can laugh the night away every Saturday at the Qianxiangyi Teahouse in Tianjin,entertained by the apprentices of Hou Baolin,Ma Sanli or Yin Shoushan--all leading crosstalk artists of years past--for only 20 yuan($2.40).\nThe success in Tianjin has also caused the rejuvenation  of crosstalk in Beijing and other places.\nAlthough the art form originated in Beijing in the Qing Dynasty(1644-1911),Tianjin became a place where rising stars formed their styles and new pieces were tried out.The city was well--known nationwide for the quality of its crosstalk performances.\nKnown in Chinese as xiangsheng(1iterally,\"face and voice\"),crosstalk was the predominant form of comedy throughout most of the 20th century.In the old days in Tianjin and elsewhere,temple fairs and markets were the main places for crosstalkers to perform,although they occasionally also appeared in teahouses or theaters.\nCrosstalk pieces draw on every aspect of Chinese culture,from history and folk tales to social issues of the time.Although there're hundreds of traditional pieces,they're constantly rewritten to suit the times and the audience, while new works are written as well.It's one of the features that have made crosstalk a\npublic art form throughout its history.\n\"Crosstalk was in the doldrums with competition from other art forms,especially TV,\"said Wang Xiaochun,headmaster of the Northern Storytelling Arts School of China(NSAS).\"But it has regained its status with crosstalk fans,especially young people,growing aware of its rare qualities.\"\n\"More and more students are coming to NSAS to study crosstalk,including some girl students,\"said Wang, \"They're sure that crosstalk will have a strong market.\"",
