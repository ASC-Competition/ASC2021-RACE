  "article": "We use both words and gestures to express our feelings, but the problem is that these words and gestures can be understood in different ways. It is true that a smile means the same thing in any language. So does laughter or crying. There are also a number of striking similarities in the way different animals show the same feelings. Dogs, tigers and humans, for example, often show their teeth when they are angry. This is probably because they are born with those behavior patterns.\nFear is another emotion that is shown in much the same way all over the world. In Chinese and in English literature, a phrase like \"he went pale and begin to tremble\" suggests that the man is either very afraid or he has just got a very big shock. However, \"he opened his eyes wide\" is used to suggest anger in Chinese whereas in English it means surprise. In Chinese \"surprise\" can be described in a phrase like 'they stretched out their tongues!' Sticking out your tongue in English is an insulting gesture or expresses strong dislike.\nEven in the same culture, people differ in ability to understand and express feelings. Experiments in America have shown that women are usually better than men at recognizing fear, anger, love and happiness on people's faces. Other studies show that older people usually find it easier to recognize or understand body language than younger people do.",
