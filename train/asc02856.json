Although we all know the importance of getting a good night's sleep, not all of us know the best way of getting it. A sleep expert, Phil Atherton, gave some top tips for getting the most out of the night, which will leave you ready for action in the morning.\nAccording to Phil Atherton, not eating a large meal before bedtime is important for getting a good night's sleep. The time difference between eating and sleeping should be at least three hours. So you'd better avoid eating any food three hours before bed, as it will lower your blood sugar during sleep and help minimize damage from too much sugar floating around.\nIt's also important to find ways to prepare your body for sleep. You can follow a routine like trying not to expose yourself to too much artificial light within 1 hour before bed, as your brain uses light to help set internal \"body clock\". Although it might seem unnatural to schedule your sleep, the purpose is to send a signal to your body and mind that it's time to sleep.\nAnother way to prepare your body for sleep is to get into a relaxed state by taking a bath or listening to soft music. Both of them will help to take the mind off the daytime pressures.\nHaving a suitable bed, especially a suitable mattress  , is necessary for a good night's sleep. Sleep is a personalized activity, and we all adopt different sleeping positions. Finding the mattress that suits you will reduce back pains that can result from a poor sleeping position. The bed should be four to six inches longer than its tallest user, allowing for space to move\naround.\nThe recent research is pretty clear that a good night's sleep in a major component of good health. Since the start of the 21st century, studies have linked a lack of sleep to many diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. Taking action now will lead to long-term benefits for you and those around you.",
