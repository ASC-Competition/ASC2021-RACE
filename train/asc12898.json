One day, being very hungry, he went into a small restaurant in Vienna, hoping he might meet some friends there. He looked around and saw nobody he could borrow any money from. Then his eyes fell on a paper on one of the tables. In it was a little poem. He took the paper with the poem. After he composed a piece of music for the poem, he took his work to the owner of the restaurant.
