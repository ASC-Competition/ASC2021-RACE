They were also asked to rate how depression affected them using the Sheehan Disability Scale , which measures impact on family, friends, chores at home, work and school.\nResearchers defined a major depressive episode as two weeks or longer of depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure, and at least four other symptoms such as problems with sleep, energy, concentration or self-image.\nNearly half of the teenagers who had major depression said it severely damaged their ability to function in at least one of the areas on the disability scale.\n\"Fortunately, depression responds very well to early intervention and treatment,\" SAMHSA Administrator Terry Cline said in a statement.",
