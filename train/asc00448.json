  "article": "About 90 percent of Chinese believe the polarization  between the rich and poor is \"serious\" in China, according to a survey conducted by China Youth Daily. And more than 80 percent of the respondents  surveyed said something must be done to narrow the expanding gap between the rich and poor, while 14.1 percent said it was necessary.\nThe polarization has aroused wide concern among the public in recent years. The State Development and Reform Commission  said the _ had reached 0.47 for China, up from o.29 two decades ago. Usually, a country with a number above 0.4 is warned to pay attention to the income inequality problem.\nTo find out the people's view, the survey covered 10,250 respondents, between the ages of 20 and 30 with a college education and a monthly salary between 1,000 and 3,000 yuan. Surprisingly, most disagreed with the view of experts who claim the urban-rural difference is causing the widening gap. More than 70 percent of the respondents believed that \" the group of special interests\" is the prime reason for the polarization, followed by \"people in power\" 68 percent, and \"bosses\" 50 percent.\nAnother unexpected finding is that almost all agreed that a good educational background and knowledge were not the decisive factors in gaining wealth. About 95 percent said rich people are not necessarily those who are able to speak English or have a college education.\nToday in China, rich people , accounting for 10 percent of the population, control 45 percent of the total social fortune, and poor people, also 10 percent of the population, only control 1.5 percent, according to an investigation published by the National Bureau of Statistics last June.",
