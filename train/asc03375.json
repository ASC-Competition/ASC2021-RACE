  "article": "Well, more and more companies are beginning to create products and services for teenagers. The Disney Company sells the Hannah Montans television show, music, film and merchandise  to teenagers and their parents. You can get everything from branded lunchboxes and mobile phone covers, to monthly fan magazines and clothing. The High School Musical series of films is also intended for a teenage audience. So, it's all about sales, which tells us teenagers must have more money, freedom and influence upon their parents than they've ever had before.\nUK teenagers never used to be worried about spending money on clothes and fashion accessories . That's changed. Now, they are much more fashion conscious and concerned about their image. In a world of television programmes that promise overnight success and fame at a young age (for example, the shows Britain's Got Talent and American Idol), some people think it's extremely important to look fashionable.\nSo what does teenage fashion look like? Well, it's quite horrible really, but then I'm a bit too old to appreciate it, I suppose. It's lots of brightly coloured materials, particularly pink, and usually plain, not patterned. There are plenty of bows, necklaces and bracelets , too. It's all very cute , if that's your taste.\nSurely none of the above is a good thing, is it? Can it really be healthy for us to encourage kids to be like adults at such a young age? Are we stealing childhoods in return for a bit of profit? Well, the UK government is certainly concerned, and for that reason has strict laws preventing companies from explicitly  marketing their products and services at children.\nEven the rest of UK society is concerned. Now that people are aware of the problem, there is a popular backlash  against the exploitation  of children by commercial marketing.",
