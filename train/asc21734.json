He was a new doctor, and did not know her, so he first asked some questions about her, and one of them was, \"How old are you?\" \"Well,\" she said, \"I don't remember, doctor, but I will try to think.\" She thought for a moment and said, \"Yes, I remember now, doctor! When I married , I was eighteen years old, and my husband  was thirty. Now my husband is sixty, I know, and that is twice thirty. So I am twice eighteen. I think I am thirty-six,is it right?\"",
