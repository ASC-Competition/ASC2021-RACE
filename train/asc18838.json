Lisa! That red skirt is very beautiful.\" Xiaobai answers her instead of   me, \"No.I think you look nice in that green skirt.\" Gina says, \"OK.I listen to you.\" Then she asks the shop assistant, \"How much is the green one?\" The shop assistant looks at Xiaobai, opens her mouth   but says nothing.At last she says to Gina, \"I never see a bird that can speak these words.It's great! You can take this green skirt.Oh, you don't need to pay for  it.\"\nGina is very happy.She asks me and my bird to have a big lunch in Leo's Restaurant and then we go home.",
