  "article": "Writing has become a fashion among today's teenagers. Look at how popular young writers like Han Han and Guo Jingming are. \n   Gao Can is a writer. Actually, the 18-year-old is the youngest member of the Association  of Writers of Shanxi. \n   So far, the second grader in the Senior High School Affiliated to Xi'an Jiaotong University has published several books. She writes fairy tales, short essays, and most of all, poems. \n   Gao said she began poem writing when she was in primary school. Once her teacher asked the class to write composition called \"If I were\". Gao had an idea--\"Why not make it a poem?\" Since then, she has written hundreds of poems and published three books of them. \n   \"I don't have too much life experience,\" said Gao. \"I write about nature, about things I feel inside and my spiritual world.\"\n   However, teenagers these days rarely write poems, or read them. Exams want \"any style but poetry\".\n   But like Gao, there are those who still read and write poems. Hu Jingzhi is one of them. The 19-year-old boy said that poems inspire them. \n   \"But it's annoying that I can't find many poem collections in nearby bookstores,\" he said. \n   Gao agreed with Hu. She said that today's bookstores were filled with books on \"how to make money quickly\" or \"how to give a successful speech\".\n   \"Poems won't teach you how to make money,\" said Gao, \" but the beautiful words clear your mind and stimulate your imagination.\"\n   \"Writing poems is not at all difficult. Just express yourself. And read poems-for their beautiful style....and for the pure things in life.\"",
