Then the owl always teaches them what they should do.\nOne day, a little bird goes up to the owl. She is crying. \"what's wrong with you?\" asks the owl.\n\"I'm not happy at all. I don't want to be a bird,\" the bird says.\n\"Why don't you want to be a bird?\" asks the owl.\n\"I am so small, weak and useless,\" she cries. \"I want to be big and strong like the lion. He is very important, but I am not\"\nThen the owl whispers  something in her ear. At once the bird dries her _ and goes away. One week later, the bird came back. \"Oh, thank you very much. You are a very wise owl,\" she says to the owl. \"I am very happy now. Every day, I sit on top of the tallest tree and watch for  lions and tigers. When they come near, I shout at the top of my voice. Then my friend all run and hide. They are very thankful to me. I am useful and important now\"\nThe wise owl smiles and says, \"No one in this world is useless.\"",
