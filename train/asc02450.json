  "article": "Loneliness is like a disease, and what's worse, it's contagious. It can spread from one person to another, according to the recent research that stresses the power of one person's emotions to affect even people they don't know.\nThe new analysis, involving 4,793 people who were interviewed every two years between 2005 and 2015, showed that a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness by the time of the next interview. A friend of that person was 25% more likely, and a friend of a friend of a friend was 15% more likely.\n''Loneliness is not just the property of an individual. It can be transmitted across people--even people you don't have direct contact with,\" said John T. Cacioppo, a psychologist of University of Chicago who led the study published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\nLoneliness has been linked to medical problems, including depression, sleep problems and generally poorer physical health. Identifying some of the causes could help reduce the emotion and improve health, experts said.\nAlthough the study did not examine how loneliness spreads, Cacioppo said another research has provided clues. \"Let's say for whatever reason you get lonely. You then interact with other people in a more negative fashion. That puts them in a negative mood and makes them more likely to interact with other people in a negative fashion and they _ their social ties and become lonely,\" Cacioppo said.\nAccording to Cacioppo, loneliness spread more easily among women than men, perhaps because women were more likely to express emotions.\nLonely people become less and less trusting others. This makes it more and more difficult for them to make friends--and more likely that society will reject them. Therefore, it is important to recognize and deal with loneliness. Cacioppo emphasizes people who have been pushed to the edges of society should receive help to repair their social networks.",
