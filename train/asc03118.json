  "article": "Your friends' lives may look more exciting than yours on Facebook,but new research shows that is because they are faking it.\nA recent survey has found around twothirds of people on social media post images  to their personal information to make their lives seem more adventurous.And more than three quarters of those asked said they judged their peers based on what they saw on their Instagram,Snapchat or Facebook pages.\nThe British survey,by smartphone maker HTC,found that,in order to make our own pages and lives appear more exciting,six percent also said they had borrowed items to include in the images in order to pass them off as their own. More than half of those surveyed said they posted images of items and places purely to show off,causing _ among friends and family.\nBehavioural psychologist Hemmings said the trend was unsurprising due to the rise of social media.\"We're living in a world of instant communication.\"she said.\"Fashion and style used to live and die in magazines;now people are in search of authentic  ,peertopeer recommendations as well,making social media an equal power house to magazines and newspapers.\"\n\"With images being shared in an instant we desire to know what our friends are wearing,or what super stars are buying, as soon as they have got them.\" Such is the influence of social media sites like Instagram,76 percent of those asked also said seeing items on social media influences them to buy them,with men more likely to take style advice and buy what they see.",
