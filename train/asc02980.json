  "article": "Tea  vs Coffee\nTea and coffee are two of the most widely consumed drinks in the United States. With popularity and interest in tea continuing to grow in recent years, many consumers have recently considered\nmaking the switch from coffee to tea, if they have not done so already. All the buzz surrounding tea\nand coffee may have you wondering, what are the differences? As it turns out, the differences are\nmany and varied.\nIn the US, interest in tea ranges from coast to coast with the highest in Hawaii and California\nbut stretching to the eastern states of Vermont and New York. On the other hand, the highest interest\nin coffee tends to be concentrated more in the north and western regions , with the highest\nsearch volumes appearing in the states of Hawaii, Washington and Minnesota.\nDifferences between tea and coffee also vary in origin and production. All tea comes from the\nharvested leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, while there are about 60 different species of coffee\nplants. Production of tea is quicker and more efficient: Camellia sinensis plants only need to grow\nfor three years before they are ready to process; coffee plants take up to five years.\nPerhaps the most concerning issue consumers have when considering making the switch to tea\nis the question of caffeine. The good news is, when it comes to tea and caffeine, there is something\nfor everyone. Unlike coffee, which typically only comes in decaffeinated and regular, there are\nseveral varieties of tea available, based on caffeine preference.\nFrom herbal teas that are naturally free of caffeine, to high quality green and black teas that\noffer less than half the caffeine of coffee, to high caffeine teas such as our specially formulated\nHiCAF(r) blends that contain slightly more caffeine than a cup of coffee, there is a variety sure to\nsuit your needs. As an added bonus, the lower acidity levels in tea tend to be gentler on the stomach\nfor a more comforting pick-me-up.\nSo what is the answer, coffee or tea? If you are looking for the most healthful benefit possible,\ntea is probably the winner. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. If, like many Americans,\nthe rising popularity in tea has your interest piqued, the images below will help to clearly spell out\nthe differences between tea and coffee.",
