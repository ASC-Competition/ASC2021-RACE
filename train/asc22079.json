  "article": "Mr. Smith drives his car to meet his friends at the station. When he finds there is still quite some time to go before the train arrives, he wants to take a short sleep. He is going to sleep when a young lady comes and asks him the time. Mr. Smith opens his eyes and answers, \"Half past eight.\" With a \"Thank you\" the woman leaves. In a short time, this happens three more times, so Mr. Smith writes \"I don't know the time!\" on a piece of paper and puts it on the window of his car. But only a few minutes later, an old man comes and wakes him up. \"Hi, young man. I can tell you the time. It's nine o' clock.\"",
