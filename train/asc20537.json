  "article": "That was my grandmother's first Christmas without Grandfather. When my parents and I arrived at her little house ,we found she had waited up all night for us.\nGrandfather had always said that the Christmas tree was the most important decoration   of all. So first we took out the beautiful tree that was stored in the closet  . But the star was _ . It was my grandmother's favorite part of the tree.\n\"Why? It must be somewhere in the closet,\" my grandmother said.\nAs we opened up boxes one by one and found no star, my grandmother's eyes were full of tears. Grandfather had given it to her some fifty years ago, on their first Christmas together. But on her first Christmas without him, the star was gone.\nThe next morning, my family sat down together to open the presents.\n\"The last gift is to Grandmother from Grandfather,\" Father said, in a strange voice.\n\"From whom?\" There was surprise in my grandmother's voice.\n\"I found this gift in Grandfather's closet when we got the tree down,\" Mother explained.\nMy grandmother opened the box.

I hope it brings you as much happiness as the first one.
