  "article": "The  Toltec---as they were now called ---began to know great abundance  and enjoy the\ngenerous gifts of the land, as had been foretold  by Quetzalcoatl.\n\"He has great powers.He has made us rich.We have not known hunger since he arrived.Where he places his eyes and hands,everything is abundance and beauty.\"\nThey were happy, they were proud. At that time they all still worked at the jobs Quetzalcoatl assigned to them.\nTula grew. People came from far away to admire its growth. Many asked permission to settle down and enjoy its abundance,which was distributed according to the needs of the people.\nTopiltzin was in charge of distributing the riches,under the orders of Quetzalcoatl, so that no one would want. They were all content because they all had more than they had ever had. Many worked.They were busy all day.\nQuetzalcoatl had spent six years among the Toltecs. The house for the heart of the people was almost finished and the granaries full when he decided.\n\"There is prosperity and abundance in all the land.Let us extend it beyond the mountains.We shall go to the land of the Chichimecs.It is time to take my mission to them. I shall make them better,I shall make them live together,I shall gather them in towns,I shall teach them to till the land and to build their homes.\"\n\"Let us leave them in their land as they are now ,\"Topiltzin argued,\"They are savages ;their life is violent and disorderly.They move freely,like the wind in the mountains and the plains,with nothing to keep them.Leave them where they are.There is much that we must do in our   own land.\n\"I do not belong to this land alone.They are all my brothers,I am to give all of them, I shall   look for them. I shall  take the gods of Tula to them,\"Quetzalcoatl said.\n\"Think carefully about what we shall do.You do not know them.They do not understand words.  They are like savage animals,like jaguars,\" Topiltzin insisted.\n\"I shall go,\"said Quetzalcoatl.\"My life must be accomplished.This time you will not accompany   me because you do not have the will to go.I shall leave soon with some of my followers.\"\n\"Do not go with so few people! I shall accompany you with skillful warriors who are used\nto killing Chichimecs and avoiding their traps.\" Topiltzin insisted.\n\"I am not going there with violence. I shall go to them as I came here,to take them the gifts of life and the doctrine of sin and redemption .\"\n\"You have not spoken of sin and redemption for a long time,\" Tattle remarked. He had been listening attentively to the dialogue,and was then close to seventeen years of age.\"You have not come near the Tree you planted in the square in a long time.The Tree has no shoots,it has not grown,it looks sad and lonely.\"\n\"During this time,Tattle,I have often thought of it.There was confusion in my spirit.Now the Tree orders me to spread good in other lands,to make other brothers happy.  It will soon have shoots.\"",
