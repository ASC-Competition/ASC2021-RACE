  "article": "Greeks play a special game at Easter and it's good fun! The rules of the game are as follows: 1.Everyone picks out a hard-boiled Waster Egg.2.Each player finds a partner.One person will be a \"holder\", and the other will be a \"tapper\".Holders should hold the egg with either the pointy end or the round end facing up.Tappers should hold the egg with that same end facing down.Tapping must be done pointy-end-to-pointy-end or round-end-to-round-end.3.With one good tap, the tapper tries to crack the holder's egg.One player will end up with a cracked egg.4.Each player finds another partner and repeats steps 2 and 3.(After one end of the egg is cracked, players may continue to play using the uncracked end).5.A player loses when both ends of his egg have been cracked.The winner is the person who still has an uncracked egg.6.Enjoy eating the eggs!\nDye your Easter eggs.With an adult's help, dye hard-boiled eggs red using food coloring or egg dye.For a nice sheen, use a paper towel to rub some oil on each egg.But don't use too much oil---you wouldn't want your egg to slide out of your hand when you play the egg-cracking game!\nWhy dye eggs red? Eggs represent new life and the red dye symbolizes the pain and suffering in the past.\nWhy crack eggs? Some say that the cracking of the eggs symbolizes a wish to break away from human misery and enter the new life.",
