  "article": "Ways to Burn More Calories\nRun through water\nRunning in water is one of the toughest activities you can perform because the wet stuff is about 12 to 15 times as resistant   as air. Try your hardest to run and you can burn about 17 calories per minute.\nStart fast\nDon't be fooled -- slow and steady won't win the race. A recent study found that after a short warm-up, cyclists who rode hard during the first half of their workouts and then slowed for the second half burned about 10 percent more calories than those who started slow and finished fast.\nTake to the sand\nHere is some easy-to-remember advice on burning calories: the softer the surface, the more you burn. By walking or running on the beach, you can use up 20 to 50 percent more calories than you do going at the same pace on a hard trail.\nShut up and dance\nHere's the perfect excuse to sign up for that hip-hop dance class you've been eager to try. Surprising your body with new activities -- dance, a new sport, you name it -- forces it to work harder because it's doing unfamiliar movements and using muscle groups in different ways.\nUse your arms\nGetting both your upper and lower body involved can provide a big calorie-burning advantage. So if you're short of time or want to get everything you can out of your usual 45-minute workout, try total-body activities such as rowing ormming. You can evenng your arms as hard as you can while you walk.",
