  "article": "A quarrel at home may result in your falling ill. Don't laugh, it's true. Family matters including living habits and even the way we speak have a big effect on our health, doctors say.\nWang Xiaoyu, a Senior 2 girl from Xichang, Sichuan Province, fainted   in class when she heard her classmates quarrel at the top of their voices. Quarrels between her parents also put the girl into a _ . It is because she is suffering from depression  , caused by bad relations at home, doctors explained.\n\"We don't get sick or stay well by ourselves,\" says Dr Robert Ferrer from the US. Ferrer shows that family forces may explain up to a quarter of health problems, in his recent research. The genes you get from your family may cause illness. If one of your parents has a heart attack, your risk of being affected may double. But effects on health are not only written in our DNA.\nUnrelated people who live under the same roof also get similar problems. Diet, lifestyle and environment affect our health, too. Ferrer's research also found that if teenagers feel they are ignored or unimportant at home they are more likely to get sick.\nWe may never fully understand all the effects that families have on our health. But just as individual   problems can have effects on others, a small improvement can have big benefits, Ferrer said.",
