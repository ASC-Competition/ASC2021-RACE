  "article": "When creating a digital advertisement or something to promote a product or service ,music is one of the most important aspects. Whether it is simply a jingle ,musical note or any other use of sound,music can play a huge role in attracting a customer's attention or being noticed by your target audience.\nMusic can work hand-in-hand with what you are advertising. Many times the advertising jingle, or saying, is what the audience remembers. Companies such as McDonald's and Subway have used this method many times with different jingles and little sayings that are easy to remember and fun to sing along with.\nUsually concepts that are part of a jingle would sound conceited   and pompous  when said in a normal conversation. When put to music however, and sung in a rhythm,it suddenly sounds attractive. For example, if someone said,\" No one does it better than me\" in a normal statement, this would sound very conceited. Add music and a tune to this statement and it becomes attractive and fun for others to sing along with.\nWhile understanding how important music is for your advertising needs, it is also important for you to know the best way to get special music.\nHaving people from many different backgrounds all over the world write something specifically for you is one of the best ways to get songs written just for you. You simply choose which one you believe is best for the project. So instead of hiring a single songwriter to compose your music, you can run a contest for you advertising jingle and songwriters around the world write you a finished jingle in an attempt to win your contest.",
