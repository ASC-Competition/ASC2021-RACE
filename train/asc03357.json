  "article": "My friend BJ Gallagher told me a great story recently, about her own experience with resentment  . She once worked as the training manager for a large newspaper, where she found the corporate culture extremely frustrating. The company was a hundred years old and their past success had blinded them to the need for change. Finally, after _ several senior executives   many times, she left the company. But she found that she hadn't left her resentment, frustration, and anger behind when she resigned.\n\"I finally decided to write about my experiences and my feelings at the newspaper. I wanted to be rid of that company and those people, once and for all. So I wrote and I wrote. It wasn't just a story that poured out; it was a whole book! We called it A peacock in the Land of Penguins. I was the peacock and those newspaper executives were the penguins.\"\n\"It took me several more years to finally get over my negative emotions. Through a lot of soul-searching and reflection, I finally was able to let go of my resentment. I came to see that there was nothing personal in the way they treated me, and they were good people doing what they thought best for the company. I was the one who had made it personal. I thought they were making my life miserable on purpose.\"[:Z#xx#k.Com]\n\"Finally, the time came when I decided to make amends   for the sharp, angry things I had said about the company. I invited my former boss to dinner and made my apology. It was a great healing process for me. I finally felt free of the resentment that had been eating me up.\"\n\"What was the final outcome?\" I asked her.\n\"Gratitude,\" she replied. \"Not only wasn't I resentful any more, I was grateful to the company. If I hadn't had those painful experiences, I would never have written a book. And the book became hugely successful - now published in 21 languages; it transformed my business.\"",
