  "article": "In today's world, English is the most wildly used language. It is our duty to learn English in the new situation of the reform and opening   to the outside world. How can we master the English language ? I'd like to give you some good advice.\nFirst, get interested in it. I enjoy listening to foreign friends talking when I was a child. At the same time I watched the English programme Follow Me on TV. From then on, I kept on learning English. The more I learned, the more progress I made.\nSecond, practice makes perfect. Many people study English very hard, but they are very shy to speak it in public, for they are afraid of making mistakes. _ A native English speaker makes mistakes sometimes, too.\nThird, the beginners should be encouraged to pay attention to idioms. The English language has many idioms. For example, you should say \" He is as strong as a cow.\"",
