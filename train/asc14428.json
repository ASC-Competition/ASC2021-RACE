  "article": "Ceaseless technology. A punishing workweek. That to -do list that keeps multiplying. It is no wonder many of us find it difficult to have a sufficient amount of sleep. But will sleeping more on the weekend make up for hours of lost snoozing  ? One sleep expert, W. Christopher Winter raised the question.\nSleeping binge\nGetting eight hours of shut-eye each night is generally recommended, but many people don't. As the week rolls from Monday to Friday, they accumulate a sleep debt. Spending a few extra hours in bed on a Saturday morning, people assume, will help them \" catch up\" on lost sleep. They're likely right, \" Nobody knows how long the horizon is, probably a few nights, but studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work,\" says Dr. Winter, a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.\nSleep banking\nRecent data suggests that banking sleep in advance of a long night can actually offset   upcoming sleep deprivation . If you knew you were going to have to stay up all night on a particular day, for example, you could sleep for 10 hours a day for multiple days before the event, and be fine, Dr. Winter says. Just plan ahead.\nRoutine  naps\nA scheduled nap is healthier than catching up on or banking sleep. \" Because sleep extension can make you feel groggy  , I always recommend a short nap [if a person feels they need it ], at the same time, every day,\" says Dr. Winter. He adds that 25 minutes is ideal. \" When you schedule a short nap, your body anticipates it and slows down, without falling into a deep dream sleep,\" he says. That refreshing, scheduled break is better than an occasional weekend lie-in. \" The body likes routine,\" he says, \" When it's prepared, it works more efficiently.\"",
