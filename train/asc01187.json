  "article": "What could make Michael Jordon, one of the greatest basketball players in history, shed tears?  It was when he became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame on September 11. The hall is in Springfield, Massachusetts and honors the best basketball players, greatest coaches and other contributors to the game. \"The game of basketball has been everything to me ,\" said Jordan, 46. \"It is the place I have always gone when I needed to find comfort and peace.\"\nJordan retired twice in his 15-year career, finishing with 32292 points, the third highest total points in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. His average of 30.12 points a game is the best in the League.\n\"One day you might look up and see me playing the game at 50,\" Jordan said. \"Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.\"   In other words, it was motivation that made Jordan such a success..\nA great career did not mean a smooth one. His high school coach cut him from the team in favor of a taller player when Jordan was in 10thgrade. His college coach wouldn't allow him on the cover of Sports Illustration in 1981 with North Carolina's four other players because Jordan was a freshman. In his first NBA All-Star game, older NBA stars wouldn't throw him the ball because of jealousy.\n\"That burned me up,\" Jordan said. \"But _ don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.\"",
