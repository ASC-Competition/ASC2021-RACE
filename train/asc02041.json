  "article": "Based on cultural traditions and the changing face of contemporary British communities, the Festival of Muslim Cultures joins young people from Muslim and non-Muslim backgrounds together through the creation of innovative , high quality cultural activities.\nWe have been working with arts and educational institutions across the UK to promote the mainstreaming of Muslim cultures within UK everyday life. The Festival was created out of the need to encourage a better understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims, to promote respect for Muslim cultures and to show how culture creates the pathways that connect us all together.\nThe program launched with a visit by the Festival's patron , the Prince of Wales, to the exhibition \"Palace and Mosque\" in Sheffield and since then there have been more than 100 events that have ranged from a Somali community day in Cardiff at the National Museum of Wales to a late-night Dance with Radio Tarifa (from Spain) and Dimi Mint Abba (form Mauritania) in the Royal Albert Hall and from a home-grown play in Nottingham about the Kashmir earthquake to the exhibition\"Beyond the Palace Walls\" at the Royal Museum Edinburgh of Islamic art from the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg.\nWe are now working on a number of long-term projects which stay true to our commitment to promoting Muslim cultures through arts collaborations  and build on the extensive network of local, national and international partners that Festival has created. These include a three-year national program that connects young Muslims to their local cultural institutions; a UK Muslim cookbook; an exhibition of the Ottoman architect Sinan; and a project for schools around the 1000-year old story \"The Animals' Lawsuit against Humanity\".\nFor more information about the Festival, please click on another page: Who's Who.",
