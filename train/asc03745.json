  "article": "No one can deny that buttons are an important clothing device. But, can they rise to the level of art? Organizers of an exhibit in New York think so.\nPeter Souleo Wright organized \"The Button Show\" at Rush Arts Gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun.\nWright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. \"What I tried to do with this show,\" he said , \"was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.\"\nHe said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting \"because of the amount of detail and precision in the work\".\nArtist Beau McCall produced \"A Harlem Hangover\". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor.\nMcCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design.\nFor San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal. After her father died in 2001, she created a portrait of him using only buttons. That memorial to her father led to other button portraits, including those of activists Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.\nOthers use buttons for details. Artist Amalia Amaki of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, placed them on and around old photographs. Los Angeles artist Camilla Taylor attached buttons to three large sculptures that look like headless animals with long , narrow legs.\n\"The Button Show\" ends at March 12. The Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation paid for the exhibition. The foundation was created in 1995 by the Simmons brothers: artist Danny, hip-hop producer Russell and rapper Rev. Run. The foundation seeks to bring the artists to urban youth and to provide support for new artists.",
