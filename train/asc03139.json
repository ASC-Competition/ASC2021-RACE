  "article": "If you happen to find \"On the Road\" at a gas station or \"Who Moved My Cheese?\" in your grocery store, it might not be and accident. You could be the unwitting beneficiary of a \"bookcrosser\"---- a person who on purpose leaves books in public places hoping they'll be found by strangers.\nThe idea o leaving a book for someone else to find and enjoy is not new ---- some people have been leaving just-finished books in airports and on buses since the dawn of the hurry-up-and-wait. Creating a system for book-leavers to find out what happened to those books adds a new way to the practice. Bokcrossing.com, the website that encourages books to be \"released into the wild\", has more than 18,000 members since its start last year, and averages 112 new participants daily.\nIts members have scattered  more than 42,000 novels, self-help books, memoirs, technical manuals and biographies in 45 countries, leaving them in public restrooms, movie theatres, coffee studios or anywhere that they can imagine. The result: a worldwide living library.\nPeri Doslu, a California yoga instructor, has dropped three--- one on top of a telephone booth, one on a rock wall at remote Mono Lake in the eastern Sierra Nevada, and another in one of the studios where she teaches.\n\"I'm always looking for paces to pass on books,\" said Doslu. \"To think my book's going to go off and have this future, and I might even get to know a little bit about it down the road.\"",
