  "article": "I'm Adam Gun from Istanbul, Turkey. I'm in a good school. And at the age of 15, in my first year of high school. I'm a great fan of tennis and cycling. I play tennis twice a week for two hours each time. Sometimes I want to play more, but I just keep playing for hours on end, never getting tired of doing it. This is one of the rare things I love in my life, in addition to cycling.\nLike tennis, I find that I'm able to ride for ever and ever. Since Istanbul is made up of large and small hills, it's a nice challenge to ride my bike every day. Although there aren't many cycling places in Istanbul, I'm lucky enough to live near the biggest park. It's downhill from my house to the park and I enjoy cycling up as much as floating down, because it's challenging.\nNow I have been thinking about being a lawyer and following my father's footsteps, but I just don't think I'm _ it. I have heard people tell me over and over again: If you want to be happy with your life, you need to like and enjoy your job. Well, I'm not sure about the fact that I will enjoy being a lawyer when I grow up. I'm just not the type of person who sits down and studies for hours. So I just need opinions on whether to become a tennis player(hopefully), to become a cyclist(hopefully) or to become a lawyer.",
