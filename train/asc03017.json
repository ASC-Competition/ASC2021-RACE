  "article": "Tom was taken to the police station and put in a room with another thief, an older man.\nThe man looked at Tom and said, \"Why have they brought you here, boy?\" \"I stole a small radio one day after lessons,\" Tom said. The man laughed rudely at him, \"you should steal something which is worth a lot if you want to be a thief. You ought to steal something really expensive, so that your name is put in the newspaper. Go and steal a lot of money from a bank next time!\"\nTom thought for a few seconds and then said, \"I can't do that!\" \"Why can't you?\" said the older man. \"Are you afraid?\" \"No,\" said Tom, \"I'm not afraid at all, but the banks are all closed at three o'clock, and my lessons don't finish until four.\"",
