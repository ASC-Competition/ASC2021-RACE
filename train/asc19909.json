  "article": "Antarctica is in the most southern part of the world. It is like nowhere else on the earth. It is much larger than Europe, and nearly twice the size of Australia. Antarctica is the coldest and windiest place in the world, even colder and windier than the North Pole. In summer, the sun shines for twenty-four hours a day, but in winter it's completely dark for about three months. Very few plants grow there, but there is some wildlife, including whales, seals and penguins.\nWhen Captain James Cook traveled around Antarctica in the 1770s by ship, he found no one living there. Today, a few scientists work in Antarctica, but they only spend a short time there.\nMany scientists are studying the _ , which is getting thinner and thinner worldwide. The biggest \"hole\" is above Antarctica, and weather there is getting warmer. Scientists think that this cold and lonely place can teach us a lot about the earth and how to keep the earth safe.",
