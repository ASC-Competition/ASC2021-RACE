  "article": "Princess Diaries star Anne Hathaway has announced she is engaged .The actress, 29,confirmed the news after she was photographed wearing a ring while with her boyfriend Adam Shulman in Brooklyn yesterday. Shulman, an actor and jewellery designer, worked with Kwiat Heritage Jewels to create the ring. The pair quietly began dating in November 2008,but weren't pictured together until the following year.\n\"We hit it off immediately the first time we met each other but it took us a pretty long time to get together,\" she has said of Shulman. \"He thought that I had a boyfriend and I thought that he had a girlfriend, so I thought that I'd better keep my distance because I didn't want to be that girl. She described their union as more mature than her previous experiences, adding, \"Being mature doesn't always make for a good story, but it makes for a good life.\"\nSpeaking about the relationship in the September issue of U.K.s Marie Claire, she said, \"Adam totally ruined my plan. I was really actually looking forward to a little time alone tod then I fell in love like a fool. Her romance with Shulman followed a disastrous relationship with an Italian real estate developer Raffaello Follieri. She split up with him in 2008 when he was arrested on fraud charges and he was later sentenced to four and a half years in prison.\nThe actress, whose film credits also include Brokeback Mountain and One Day, will next star in the new The Dark Knight Rises. She plays Selina Kyle, also known as Catwoman.",
