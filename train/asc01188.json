  "article": "Dear Editor,\nI'm now busy in preparing for the Postgraduate   Entrance Exam. A few days ago, I happened to see some new guidebooks for those who want to take next year's exam. With too many hopes and without taking it into too much consideration, I bought several that were written by some known for helping candidates   for master's degrees.\nWhat made me really angry was the starting discovery that the contents of those books were almost exactly the same as some I had bought before. There were only superficial   changes in their covers, with more attractive new titles and better designs. The contents were the same.\nPeople say that the publishing industry is in a state of chaos   these days but I used to be doubtful abut that. I was of the opinion that only people of noble character, prestige  , and exceptional talent would produce books for higher education. But these editors are caring little about their readers.\nI hope that authors and publishing houses will be more responsible for their readers. Don't destroy the image that you have with your readers.",
