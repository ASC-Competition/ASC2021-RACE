  "article": "A man walked into a small Irish pub and ordered three beers. Bartender was surprised, but he served that man three beers. One hour later the man ordered three beers again. The very next day that man ordered three beers again and drank quietly at a table. This repeated several times and shortly after the people of the town were whispering about the man, who was ordering three beers at once.\nA couple of weeks later, the bartender decided to clear this out and inquired: \"I do not want to pry, but could you explain, why do you order three beers all the time?\" The man replied: \"It seems strange, isn't it? You see, my two brothers live abroad at the moment, one - in France and another - in Italy. We have made an agreement, that every time we go to pub each of us will order extra two beers and it will help keeping up the family bond \".\nSoon all the town have heard about the man's answer and liked it a lot. The man became a local celebrity. Residents of the town were telling this story to newcomers or tourists and even invited them to that pub to look at Three Beer Man.\nHowever, one day the man came to pub and ordered only two beers, not three as usual. The bartender served him with bad feeling. All that evening the man ordered and drank only two beers. The very next day all the town was talking about this news, some people pray for the soul of one of the brothers, others quietly grieve.\nWhen the man came to pub the next time and ordered two beers again, the bartender asked him: \"I would like to offer _ to you, due to the death of your dear brother\". The man considered this for a moment and then replied: \"Oh, you are probably surprised that I order only two beers now? Well, my two brothers are alive and well. It's just because of my decision. I promised myself to give up drinking.\"",
