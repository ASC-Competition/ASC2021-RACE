  "article": "Teaching your child to cook is not hard; the hard part could be getting them out of the kitchen. When you are teaching them, remember to stress safety and cleanliness, after all these are skills they will need for many years into the future.\nStart by finding simple no-cook recipes. A salad or other no-cook recipe is an ideal way to start. Show your child how to hold, and cut with knives. Make sure they know how to wash everything in hot soapy water as they use it, so that it becomes a habit that is part of the process and not an extra chore to do after they have finished.\nIf possible, find one of the good children's cookbooks that are available. Many of these have simple recipes that demonstrate the basic cooking terms such as chop, mix, and stir. When it is practical, you may as well have your child help you prepare meals. Even a small child can get bowls out, pour, and start learning to measure. A two- year -old child can stir a batter , or taste the results.\nAllow your older child to find a recipe that they think sounds nice. Go over the recipe with them as you discuss the steps needed, and how to adjust any ingredients to match your budget, and family preferences.\nWhen you go shopping, have your child help find the necessary ingredients for their 'special' recipe. When it is time to make the recipe, allow them to do as much as possible, only helping out if asked or when they run into trouble. Be sure to praise their efforts even if they are not perfect. After the results are gone, talk about any problems, and see if there is a solution.\nMost children like to cook, and if they are part of deciding what to cook, as well as the preparation they will be well on the way to being good cooks.",
