  "article": "A child, who has once got interested in a tale, likes, as a rule, to have it retold in almost the same words, but this should not lead parents to treat printed fairy stories as formal texts. It is always much better to \"tell\" a story than just \"read\" it out of a book, and, if a parent can produce his own as an improvement on the printed text, according to his child's actual situation, so much the better.\nThere is a charge made against some fairy tales, as they probably harm children by frightening them or leaving them sad feelings. To prove it, an experiment has been done to show that children who have heard terrible fairy stories often feel more uneasy than those who have not. As for fears, there are some cases where children get timid   by some fairy story. Often, however, this arises from the child having heard the story once. Familiarity with the story by repetition may weaken the pain of fear.\nThere are also people who object to fairy stories on the grounds that the stories are not objectively true, and that those giants, witches, two-headed dragons, magic carpets etc. do not really exist, so children should be taught to learn the reality by studying history, instead of being got fond of the strange side in fairy tales. Those, who prefer to create such stories, are so peculiar   that it is hard to argue with them. If their creative exaggeration   were _ , the world should be full of mad men attempting to fly from New York to Philadelphia on a stick or covering a telephone with kisses in the belief that it was their beloved girl-friend.\nNot once is a fairy story ever declared to be a description of the real world, but not every child is clever enough to be aware of it. Parents should choose their children's \"bed-time\" reading materials with much care. Only the fairy stories containing positive effect will make a clever and caring child with rich imagination.",
