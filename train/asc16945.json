  "article": "In Britain in the 1890s there was a postcard \"craze \". People formed clubs and collected and exchanged postcards. Even Queen Victoria had her own private collection.\nWhen Edward was the king, the British had a cheap and good postal system. If anyone wanted to tell a friend that they were coming for tea in the afternoon, they would send a postcard in the morning. \"Drop me a card\" was as common then as \"give me a ring\" as now.\nIn 1902 an important step was taken. The government said that half of the side that was used for the address on the postcard could be used for messages, and the whole of the other side could be used for a picture. It was then that the simple postcard, as we know now, was created.",
