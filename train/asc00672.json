  "article": "Jessica Alba rebelled  from her \"strict\" parents when she was just five. The 29-year-old actress admits her Catholic  education made her want to \"break away\" from her mother Catherine and father Mark.\nShe explained: \"It's always been weird  because I grew up in a very traditional, Catholic household. My parents were very strict but I broke away from that at an early age. I was a feminist  when I was five. These days, I am much more independent but I still respect their beliefs.\"\nAs Jessica has grown older she has learnt to accept her parents' views, but still considers herself an independent woman.\nIn her latest film 'Machete' Jessica gets to stab  a love rival in the eye with her stiletto heels , something she thoroughly enjoyed.\nShe said: \"Walking in 3in heels wasn't as much fun as putting one in someone's eye. It was 104 degrees where we were shooting in Texas and they were not comfortable.\"\nJessica - who has a two-year-old daughter Honor with husband Cash Warren - is regularly referred to as one of the world's most beautiful women, but she doesn't think of herself as \"sexy\".\nShe added in an interview with the Metro newspaper: \"I don't really pay attention to that sexy image. It just goes with the character in the movie. At the end of the day, it's all a part of selling a product.\"",
