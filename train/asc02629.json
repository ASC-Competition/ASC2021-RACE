  "article": "C    What historical site impresses you most? I've always been fascinated by the pyramids in Egypt.A few years ago I braved a long queue and climbed through a narrow passage to reach the main chamber deep inside one of them.Like millions of other tourists, I marveled   at stone-walled rooms full of the magic of this ancient civilization.\nBut popularity might be the destruction of such archaeological treasures.Take Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings for example.It lay untouched for more than 3,000 years until the British archaeologist Howard Carter uncovered it in 1922.Now more than 1,000 people a day walk through it.\nBut as more and more people visit, the temperature and humidity inside the tomb change.As a result, the beautifully decorated plaster is coming away from the rock.\nIn order to preserve its heritage, a replica   of the monument is being opened about 1 kilometer away from the actual burial site.Specialists have recorded every detail of Tutankhamun's tomb and used the data to recreate it.\nAdam Lowe from the organization behind the project says the copy is identical to the original.He believes visitors will want to become part of the force that protects it rather than a force that is leading to its destruction.So they won't mind seeing a replica.\nBut for historian Tom Holland, a copy is still a copy.He believes that although preservation is important, there is something unique about places like Tutankhamun's tomb.He says it was built by people who believed in the world of the spirits, the dead and the supernatural.You don't have to believe in a god or gods to feel a place is consecrated   and has a particular quality that can't be reproduced.\nWhat about you? Would you visit a replica of a monument rather than the original to help preserve it?",
