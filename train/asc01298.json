  "article": "When I was having a walk through the park today, I met a friend I hadn't seen for ages. She stared at me curiously. \"You have kept this umbrella for years; it's old and out of date. I wonder why you keep it and take it wherever you go.\" I smiled, \"it means a great deal to me.\" I simply gave her my shortest answer. Honestly speaking, I, either, could not understand the reason why I kept it.\nThen all of a sudden, fallen leaves darkened my eyes with a strong wind. I grabbed the umbrella instinctively. The rain poured down. Thanks to my umbrella, I didn't get wet at all.\n\"Why have I kept it for so long?\" I asked myself, staring at my umbrella. I couldn't remember when and where I bought it, for I'm always tired and lazy to answer questions. It could protect me from the heavy rain, I told myself eventually. Looking at the people rushing through the street, I felt safe. This might be another reason.\nIt is always so. We know a thunderstorm comes unexpectedly and goes without a warning. The sky cleared up. The sun shone brightly. Just as usual, I seized the umbrella with my left hand. Still there's water dropping down. I walked among the noisy crowd and listened to what they were murmuring in their heart. \"Today I will ask for a rise, or I'll leave this company.\" Good luck to you, I smiled to him. \"I'll manage to make you live forever.\" A little boy held a pet dog close to him. \"She'll be all right, because she is blessed.\" I heard angels singing in this city.\nThe moment my fingertips touched the umbrella, I felt it's dry, and it's warm. Soon it became hot. I held it up to avoid harmful sunshine. Do I need a reason to explain why? Maybe I should think about it. I need my umbrella when it is sunny as well as when it is rainy.",
