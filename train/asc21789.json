  "article": "Hello! My name is Emma. My favorite day is Friday. Do you know why?  We have four classes in the morning. We have a music lesson on Friday morning. It is my favorite subject. I also like other three lessons in the morning. They are English, Chinese and math. In the afternoon we usually have three classes, but on Friday afternoon we only have two classes P.E. and oral  English. P.E. teacher is my favorite teacher because her lessons are very interesting.",
