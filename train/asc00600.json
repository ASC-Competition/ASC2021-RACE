  "article": "A mother, who wished to encourage her son's progress in playing the piano, bought tickets for a performance by the great Polish pianist Ignace Paderewski.When the evening arrived, they found their seats near the front of the concert hall and eyed the impressive Steinway waiting on the stage.Not long after they arrived, the mother came across a friend in the hall and they began to talk with each other.Meanwhile the boy slipped away and could be found nowhere.\nAt eight o'clock, the lights in the concert hall began to fail, and then the spotlights  came on.Only then did they notice the boy who was up on the piano bench, innocently picking out \"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star\".Seeing this, his mother was shocked and embarrassed.But before she could bring her son back, the master appeared on the stage and quickly moved to the keyboard.\nHe whispered gently to the boy, \"Don't quit.Keep playing.\" Learning over, Paderewski reached down with his left hand and began filling in the bass  part.Soon his right arm reached around the other side and performed a delightful accompaniment .Together, the old master and the young boy performed so wonderfully and harmoniously on the stage and they held the attention of the crowd with their beautiful music.\nIn all our lives, we receive helping hands from time to time--some we notice; some we don't.Equally we ourselves have countless opportunities to offer helping hands--sometimes we want our assistance to be noticed, sometimes we don't.Little of what we all achieve is without learning from others and without support from others.We are supposed to hand out what we have received.",
