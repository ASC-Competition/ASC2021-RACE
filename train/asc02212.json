  "article": "Last year I ruined my summer vacation by bringing along a modern convenience that was too convenient for my own good: the iPad. Instead of looking at nature, I checked my e-mail. Instead of paddling a small boat, I followed my Twitter feed . Instead of reading great novels, I stuck to reading four newspapers each morning. I was behaving as if I were still in the office. My body was on vacation, but my head wasn't.\nSo this year I made up my mind to try something different: withdrawal from the Internet. I knew it wouldn't be easy, since I'm bad at self-control.  But I was determined.  I started by giving the iPad to my wife.\nThe cellphone signal at our house was worse than in the past, making my attempts at cheating an experience in frustration  . I was trapped, forced to go through with my plan. Largely cut off from e-mail, Twitter and my favorite newspaper websites, I had few ways to connect to the world except for the radio--and how much radio can one listen to, really? I had to do what I had planned to do all along: read books.\nThis experience has had a happy ending. With determination and the strong support of my wife, I won in my vacation straggle against the Internet, realizing finally that it was I, not the iPad, that was the problem. I knew I had won when we passed a Starbucks and my wife asked if I wanted to stop to use the Wi-Fi. \"I don't need it,\" I said.\nHowever, as we return to post-vacation life, a harder test begins: Can I continue when I'm back at work?\nThere are times when the need to know what's being said right now is great.  I have no intention of giving up my convenience completely. But I hope to resist the temptation  to check my e-mail every five minutes, which leads to checking my Twitter feed and a website ortwo.\nI think a vacation is supposed to help you reset your brain to become more productive. Here I hope this one worked.",
