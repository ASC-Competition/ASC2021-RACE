  "article": "Oldest , Youngest , or in the Middle ?\nWere you the first or last child in your family? Or were you a middle or the only child? Some people think it matters where you were born in your family. But there are different ideas about what birth order means.\nSome people say that oldest children are smart and strong-willed. They are very likely to be successful. The reason for this is simple. Parents have a lot of time for their first child. They give him or her a lot of attention. So this child is very likely to do well. An only child will succeed for the same reasons.\nWhat happens to the other children in a family? Middle children don't get so much attention. So they don't feel that important. If a family has many children, the middle ones sometimes get lost in the crowd. The youngest child, though, often gets special treatment. He or she is the \"baby\". Often this child grows up to be funny and charming.\nDo you believe these ideas about birth order? A recent study saw things quite differently. This study found that the first children believed in family rules. They didn't take many chances in their lives. They usually followed their own ideas . They took chances. And they often did better in life.\nWhich _ about birth order do you believe? Look at your own family or you friends' families. Decide which idea fits what you see.",
