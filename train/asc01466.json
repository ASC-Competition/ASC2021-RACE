  "article": "Papa's Straw Hat\nPapa was a ranger. He worked with horses. He always wore clean clothes with a hat even when he worked. His hat was always the same kind of a cowboy hat- large black hat of heavy wool. He wore his hat full and high. I think he wanted to look taller than he really was.\nMama was proud of the way he looked when he wore his hat and his best clothes. But in some way she got the idea that papa would lose his hair if he kept wearing a heavy wool cowboy hat in the hot weather. She began to talk about his hats.\n\"Papa,\" she said one day, \"why don't you get a nice cool straw hat? That heavy wool cowboy hat may cause losing hair!\" Papa laughed at her and explained that the horses wouldn't recognize him if he changed the hat. But she didn't believe him.\nMama talked and talked about the hat all summer long. At last papa answered, a little angry, \"It would not the cowboy hat but a wife's talking about the hat that makes me lose my hair.\"\nMama had a very serious look on her face. She went straight out and later came home with a straw hat. It was a bad year for ranger and we didn't have much money. She thought that if she spent the money for a straw hat, papa would wear it. When papa saw the hat, his face got red. Without a word, he pulled the straw hat down over his head until it hid his eyes and went on to train the horses.\nHe was a good ranger and gentle to his horses. But as papa got close to the horses this time, they jumped high into the air, raising their front feet. All of them ran around in the rounded field and then raced toward the barn. Papa began to shout \"Woo boys. Steady boys, steady.\" But there was nothing equal to.\nPapa walked back straight to the stove in the kitchen, pushed the straw hat deep down into the fire then turned to mama, in a way that even frightened me. \"Now listen to me, mama. Understand this I will never wear a straw hat or any other kind of hat my horses do not like.\" Then he put on his wool cowboy hat and walked out of the house.\nI never heard mama talk any more about hats. Perhaps, that is why when papa died many years later, there was a round spot on the top of his head where there was no hair.",
