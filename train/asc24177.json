Then cross the road, and take the first turning on the left. Walk for five minutes. Then you will see a big tree. Take the second on the right after the tree. Walk about a hundred metres down this road. There is a big red house. Go past the big house about five hundred metres, and you will see a small yellow house beside a little tree.
