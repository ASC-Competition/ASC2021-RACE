  "article": "For shopoholics, the post-Christmas period means only one thing ---- sales! Across the country, prices are reducing sharply on clothing, electronics and home furniture, but London is the place for serious shopping, and you can certainly pick up some amazing bargains.\nThe sales start on Boxing Day -- 26th December, and continue for the month of January, but the keenest bargain hunters get there early to be first through the doors. In Oxford Street queues formed outside shops ahead of before-dawn openings for the start of their sales. At Brent Cross, in north London, more than 1,000 people were queuing at 3.30 am for the 'Next' clothing store's sale which began at 4 am. Some eager individuals even camped outside the shops to be first in the line.\nConsumers who _ were rewarded with discounts of as much as 80% as department stores joined the bargain sales. The shops are very crowded as the sales reached the boiling-point, with more than half a million people gathering on London's West End.\nFamous sales include the biggest, most popular shops such as Harrods, Selfridges, Liberty and John Lewis. Department stores are always a good bet -- you're likely to find everything you need under one roof, including much-needed food and drinks!\nIt's a good time to stock up on cheap small tools, and there's no better time to invest in some designer clothes.\nSome people are taking their partners shopping with them, and buying their Christmas presents in the sale----a practical but unromantic way of making sure you get the gift you really want. For a less exciting but less stressful shopping experience, online sellers are also getting in on the act with January sales of their own.\nThe most organized of all are those who are already doing their present shopping for next Christmas, in the January sales!",
