In the day you can swim in the pool or play games on the ship. You can even see a film on the ship. Sometimes you can see birds flying around you. They are flying here and there. Look at the picture of the ship. Does it look like a house? It's very large. And it's the most luxury passenger liner  in the world, called 'Freedom of the Seas' . The ship is 339 meters long and 38.6 meters wide, with a golf field on it. It's so cool to take a trip on a ship!",
