  "article": "A visit to a zoo can be an amazing experience for people of all ages. If you want to get close to wildlife, why not visit one of the following zoos in the UK?\nLongleat Safari  & Adventure Park\nWiltshire's Longleat Safari & Adventure Park is the UK's oldest safari park. Opened in 1966, it was the first safari park opened outside Africa. It was just a 100-acre lion reserve in the beginning, but it has grown fast over the years. Now you can see parrots and other creatures here, although lions are still popular with many people.\nOpen from mid-February to early November, a day ticket costsPS26 for adults. Admission  for 3- to 14-year-old isPS18.50 andPS21 for the over-60s.\nLocated just off the A36 between Bath and Salisbury, it can be reached by taking the A362.\nBristol Zoo\nBristol Zoo is one of the UK's oldest zoos. It will celebrate its 180th anniversary  in 2016. Here, you'll find over 400 different species of creatures. It also has nine animal houses, so even if the weather isn't at its best, there are still lots of amazing creatures to look at, including the endangered red panda. Perhaps one of the most popular places is Bug World, where you can see all kinds of scary insects.\nAdmission for adults isPS14 andPS8.50 for 3- to 14-year-olds.\nLocated in the Clifton region of Bristol, you can reach the zoo by taking either the No. 8 or 9 bus.
