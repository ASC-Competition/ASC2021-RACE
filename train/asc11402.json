  "article": "The publication of \"Harry Potterandthe Half-Blood Prince\" gladdens booksellers across China. The British and American editions were No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the sales chart of the Beijing Xidan Book Building last week. The book's poster is highlighted and news about the book can often be heard on the radio.\nWhy is the book so attractive to children? With curious mood, the author got a copy of \"Harry Potter\". Originally, I wanted to glance over it and made some criticisms. But, out of expectation, the author has been deeply attracted by the magic world. On the other hand, one cannot help asking:  _ Harry Potter\"?\nThe Chinese nation has a history of 5, 000 years, which cannot be regarded as short and its culture as not profound. With a vast market of youngsters, China did publish many books popular among children. However, why are the present works not as good as those imported?\nThere come two major reasons: Firstly, quite a number of children's books are of strong sense of teaching, and lack interest and entertainment. Children often have a feeling of being \"educated\". No wonder they don't like them. Secondly, children's reading materials involving \"idiom stories\" and \"Chinese talents' stories\", though always in different covers, are usually much the same or plagiarized . One knows the ending as early as in the beginning. In final analysis, the authors of the books seldom take children's requirements into consideration.\nAs a matter of fact, each child has his own wonderful imagination. They long to understand the world and nature. Similarly they have their own choices. They dislike similar stories, even if the stories are excellent. First-class reading for children should be very interesting, which contains knowledge and the essence  of national culture, which are presented in children's language.\nMarket is a touchstone for products. The theory also holds true for cultural products. It is hoped that the authors of children's books can learn something from the good market of \"Harry Potter\" and write out more and better books loved by children.",
