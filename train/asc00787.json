  "article": "Only two countries in the advanced world provide no guarantee for paid leave from work to care for a newborn child.Last spring one of the two,Australia,gave up the bad distinction by setting up paid family leave starting in 2011.I wasn't surprised when this didn't make the news here in the United States--we're now the only wealthy country without such a policy.\nThe United States does have one explicit family policy,the Family and Medical Leave Act,passed in 1993.It entitles workers to as much as 12 weeks' unpaid leave for care of a newborn or dealing with a family medical problem.Despite the modesty of the benefit,the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups fought it bitterly,describing it as \"government-run personnel management\" and a \"dangerous precedent .\" In fact,every step of the way,as (usually) Democratic leaders have tried to introduce work-family balance measures into the law,business groups have been strongly opposed.\nAs Yale law professor Anne Alstott argues,justifying parental support depends on defining the family as a social good that,in some sense,society must pay for.Parents are burdened in many ways in their lives: there is \"no exit\" when it comes to children.Society expects--and needs--parents to provide their children with continuity of care.And society expects--and needs--parents to persist in their roles for 18 years,or longer if needed.",
