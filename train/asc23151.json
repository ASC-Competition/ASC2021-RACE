  "article": "In the USA, about 450,000 school buses take more than 25 million children to and from school. The yellow school bus is a US icon  . Yellow became the color of school buses in the USA in 1939. Dr. Frank got the good idea. He said it was easy for people to see yellow buses and the black letters on them in early morning or late afternoon. That would make children safer.\nThere are not many school buses in Britain, and they are not yellow. They have trackers   on them, so children are being tracked while they travel to and from school by bus. The trackers let parents know where the school bus is and whether their kids are on the bus.\nKindergarten   is a difficult time for some kids. It's the first time for them to go away from their parents. To make kids love their school, Japanese kindergartens and schools have colorful buses. The buses can easily make children want to take them to go to school. Even some parents want to take them, too!\nSchool buses are becoming more and more popular in China now. It saves a lot of time for students to go to school.\n,.",
