  "article": "Long, long ago there was a very foolish thief. Do you know what he did one day? When he wanted to steal   the bell on his neighbor's door, he walked up to the door, took hold of   the bell and pulled hard. The bell made a very loud noise. The thief was afraid and went home.\nThen he sat down to think, \"I must do something about the noise,\" he said. He thought and thought. At last he had an idea. \"Ah, I'll put some cotton in my ears. Then I won't be able to hear the noise.\" The next day he went to the door of his neighbor, and took hold of the bell. This time he pulled even harder. The bell rang loudly, but the thief did not hear anything. With another hard pull he got the bell out. Just then the neighbor came running out. \"Steal my bell? I'll teach you a lesson  ,\"the angry man shouted. And he hit the thief on the nose.\nThe foolish thief did not know how the neighbor found out he was stealing the bell. \"Why did he come out just then?\" he wondered  .",
