  "article": "My friend Jim was a well-known radio host, who worked at a radio station all his life. All his colleagues knew him about one characteristic: If he's on-air, he is always wearing a suit and a tie. They laughed at him, saying, \"No one ever sees you. Why do you dress like that?\" But he always turned that into a joke.\nOne day Jim was invited to appear on the TV. There was a show for the oldest radio employees. For the first time his fans, who only knew Jim by his voice, would see him. Before the recording of the show, the director came to Jim and asked, \"Usually you arrive on time, but today you are 10 minutes late. It's not terrible, but I still want to know why.\"\n\"You see,\" Jim answered, \"at the last moment when I was already dressed up, I noticed that I didn't have new socks. For the first time I was invited to the television, and I thought that simply wearing clean socks was not enough. So I needed to go to the store for new socks.\"\nThe director was surprised. He asked, \"Why do you need new socks? You could have come without the socks because we will be filming you only over the waist.\"\n\" You see, to be perfect, I need to feel myself perfect in everything, starting with the shirt and finishing with the pen in my pocket,\" Jim said. \"And if my socks have holes in them or my shoes are dirty, I'm not spotless anymore. And it may make me less confident.\"",
