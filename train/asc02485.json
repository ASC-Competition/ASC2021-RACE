It wasn't perfect. It did, however, show signs of working like a kidney should.\n\"It's really beautiful work,\" Edward Ross, a kidney researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville, told Science News. He didn't work on the new study.\nKidneys are bean-shaped and act like guards in the body. They clean the blood by removing waste and extra water. Every day, an adult's kidneys filter  enough blood to fill a bathtub half full. Along the way, they produce eight cups of urine  from that waste and water. When a person's kidneys fail, all of that waste stays in the body. Such patients can quickly become very sick and die, unless they are regularly connected to a machine that filters their blood.\nAt any given time, about 100,000 people in the United States are waiting for a replacement kidney. But healthy donated kidneys are difficult to get. Either a living person must donate one, or a kidney must be removed from someone who just died and earlier had agreed to the donation. In either case, people receiving new kidneys face the risk that their bodies will reject the donated ones.\nBut there may be another option.  Researchers use knowledge of living things to grow or improve tissue that can aid human health. Harald Ott's team at Harvard started with a \"used\" kidney.\nScientists added kidney cells from rats and blood vessel cells from people to the matrix . These cells attached themselves and began to multiply. Before long, they formed new kidney tissue.\nThe scientists placed this renewed kidney into another rat. There it produced a small amount of urine. This experiment shows that the lab-grown kidney can do at least some of the work performed by a healthy kidney.\nThe results are a promising first step toward helping people with serious kidney problems. \"This is still very early, but they've come a long way,\" Ross said.",
