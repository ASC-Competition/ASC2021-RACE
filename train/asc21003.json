  "article": "Many years ago,there was a very popular sport in America. Who invented the sport more than 3,000 years ago? We don't know . But everyone thinks it was the 01mecs made it popular.\nPeople don't have the same rules about the game all over the world . People in different parts of the world play the game in different places at different times. If we want to bring back the sport, we need to have two teams of players standing on each end of a court. When the game begins, the two teams need to pass a ball with their hands and feet. The players can't touch the ball with their hands and feet.\nBut they can use their elbows  and other parts of their bodies hit it. If a player does not pick up t he ball in time and lets it fall to the ground, that team loses a point. Or if a player makes the ball through a hoop ,that team scores a point. The team with the most points wins the game.",
