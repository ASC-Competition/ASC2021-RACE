  "article": "Dear Mr. Wolfson,\nThe purpose of this letter is to inform you of one of our citizens who I believe should receive some special recognition for dedicated   community service. The person I recommend is Elizabeth Samuelson. I believe you know her in your position as volunteer coordinator  .\nI have known Elizabeth for more than 20 years as both a friend and a neighbor. During that time I have seen her work tirelessly on scores of community projects and committees. As far as I know, she has never received any kind of recognition from the community for her work. I believe she should be given some sort of special recognition.\nJust last year alone, she worked on at least six different community projects including the Park Renewal Project and the Heritage Homes FundRaising Banquet. In addition, she is a weekly driver for the MealsonWheels program and she visits patients in the care unit on a regular basis. Whenever a project or committee needs her, she will put herself into the work wholeheartedly. I'm sure that if you check with a few of your staff members who have been there over the years, they will confirm Elizabeth's community service record and probably be able to add many examples to the few I have given here. By the way, Elizabeth has no idea that I am writing this. She is a humble   person, and if she were aware of it, she would not allow me to send it.\nI thought about writing such a letter about her a number of times in the past but just never took action. Then last week, I noticed in the paper that you sponsor   an annual dinner at which dozens of awards are given out to people with much less community service than Elizabeth. In fact, I checked with her and she has never even been invited to that annual event!\nI urge you to correct that omission   now and take action to see that Elizabeth is properly recognized for her many years of silent but outstanding service to this community.\nSincerely,\nLinda Sullivan",
