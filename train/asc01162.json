  "article": "In Eastern Europe, blue jeans symbolize   American culture and \"the good life\". In Spain they are known as \"cowboys\". In China, jeans are known as \"niuzaiku\", also, \"cowboy trousers\", which means they are connected with the American West cowboy culture and outdoor work.\nJeans are usually made from denim  , but may also be made from other materials. The earliest known cloth for jeans was a thick cotton cloth from the Indians. At first they were working clothes. They became popular among teenagers in the 1950s. Today jeans are a very popular form of casual wear around the world and come in many styles and colors.\nJeans were first made in Genoa in Italy. The trousers were made for the Genoese navy   because they needed trousers which could be worn wet or dry, and whose legs could be easily rolled up while the men were cleaning the ships. These jeans would be washed by pulling them in large fishing nets behind the ship, and the sea water would make them white.\nIn the 1850s Levi Strauss, a business man living in San Francisco, was selling blue jeans under the \"Levi's\" name to the coal workers of California.\nDuring World War II, the coal workers liked jeans very much because they were strong and did not tear easily. In the 1950s, jeans became popular with young people in the United States. Wearing of blue jeans by teenagers was the symbol of rebels   in TV programmes and movies. Some cinemas and restaurants refused to let people in if they wore blue jeans. In the 1980s, jeans finally became high fashion clothing, when famous designers started making their own styles of jeans, with their own labels on them. Sales of jeans went up and up.",
