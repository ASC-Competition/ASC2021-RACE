  "article": "Wine drinkers tend to buy healthier food than beer drinkers, according to a Danish study published on Tuesday on the website of a weekly medical magazine.\nPeople who bought wine at the store were also more likely to buy fruit, vegetables, fish, lean meat   and milk than beer buyers did, said the study.\nBeer buyers were more likely to buy frozen dinners, cold cuts, pork, sugary products, and soft drinks.\nThe study was conducted by four researchers from the National Institute of Public Health over the course of six months.\nAlcohol researchers Erik Schulenburg and Marten Greenback and two other doctors collected 3.5 million receipts from 98 stores. The customers at the stores represented a large number of Danish people, they said.\n\"Our results confirm international studies which show that wine drinkers tend to eat more fruit, vegetables and fish and rarely eat fats, compared to those who like other kinds of alcoholic drinks,\" they concluded.\nWine buyers also tended to have higher education levels, higher earnings and be in better mental health, they added.\nTheir interest in consumers' shopping bags followed a series of studies in the Danish media. The studies suggested that wine drinkers ran a lower risk of cardiovascular   disease and some types of cancer than beer drinkers.",
