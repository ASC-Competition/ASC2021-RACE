He is not confident  because of his color. But he thinks he has special talents. So the goes on a magic trip.\nOn his trip he meets Miranda, Hamish and Lokie. And they become friends. They fight with their wits  against Bog.\nI think this movie tells us: whatever   you look like, you can become a hero.\nI give the movie five stars. It is a great movie for ages six and up. Because there are some scary parts in the movie, I wouldn't recommend  it to kids under the age of six.\n,.",
