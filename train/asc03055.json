  "article": "A taxi driver taught me a million dollar lesson in customer satisfaction and expectation. Motivational speakers charge thousands of dollars to give training to company executives and staff. It cost me a $12 taxi ride.\nI had flown into Dallas for the purpose of calling on a customer. Time was limited and my plan included a quick turn-around trip from and back to the airport. A spotless taxi pulled up. The driver rushed to open the passenger door for me and made sure I was comfortably seated before he closed the door. As he got in the driver's seat, he mentioned that the neatly-folded Wall Street Journal next to me was for my use. He then showed me several tapes and asked me what type of music I would enjoy. I could not believe the service I was receiving! I took the opportunity to say, \"Obviously you take great pride in your work. You must have a story to tell.\"\n\"You bet,\" he replied, \"I used to be in Microsoft. But I got tired of it, thinking my best would never be good enough. I decided to find my position in life where I could feel proud of being the best I could be. I knew I would never be a rocket scientist, but I love driving cars, helping people and feeling like I have done a full day's work and done it well. I thought about my personal strengths and ... wham! I became a taxi driver. One thing I know for sure, to be good in my business I could simply meet the expectations of my passengers. But, to be GREAT in my business, I have to go above the customer's expectations! I like both the sound and the return of being 'great' better than just getting by being 'average'.\"",
