  "article": "The famous director of a big and expensive movie planned to film a beautiful sunset over the ocean, so that the audiences could see his hero and heroine in front of it at the end of the film as they said goodbye to each other for ever. He sent his camera crew  out one evening to film the sunset for him.\nThe next morning he said to the men, \"Have you provided me with that sunset?\"\n\"No, sir,\" the men answered.\nThe director was angry. \"Why not?\" he asked.\n\"Well, sir,\" one of the men answered, \"we're on the east coast here, and the sun sets in the west. We can get you a sunrise over the sea, if necessary, but not a sunset.\"\n\"But I want a sunset!\" the director shouted. \"Go to the airport, take the next flight to the west coast, and get one.\"\nBut then a young secretary had an idea. \"Why don't you photograph a sunrise,\" she suggested, \"and then play it backwards? Then it'll look like a sunset.\"\n\"That's a very good idea!\" the director said. Then he turned to the camera crew and said, \"Tomorrow morning I want you to get me a beautiful sunrise over the sea.\"\nThe camera crew went out early the next morning and filmed a bright sunrise over the beach in the middle of a beautiful bay. Then at nine o'clock they took it to the director. \"Here it is, sir,\" they said, and gave it to him. He was very pleased.\nThey all went into the studio. \"All right,\" the director explained, \"now our hero and heroine are going to say goodbye. Run the film backwards so that we can see the 'sunset' behind them.\"\nThe \"sunset\" began, but after a quarter of a minute, the director suddenly put his face in his hands and shouted to the camera crew to stop.\nThe birds in the film were flying backwards, and the waves on the sea were going away from the beach.",
