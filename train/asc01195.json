You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you!\nParapsychologists   say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a \"sixth sense\" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments.\nIn the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them.\nFor the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed.\nBaker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, \"I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves.\"",
