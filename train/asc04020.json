  "article": "Ray Charles Robinson, a blind musician in America, was famous for his records of jazz, rock 'n' roll, blues and country music. But the world knew him better as Ray Charles. He had an influence on American popular music.\nThe song Let's Go Get Stoned is an example of Ray Charles' own kind of music--his own sound. He worked hard for several years to create that sound. No one ever tried it before. He mixed black church music, blues and rock 'n' roll. The sound was extremely successful. In the nineteen fifties, his records began to sell millions of copies. At the same time, Ray Charles recorded jazz music. Those records sold well, too. People said they were new and exciting.\nRay Charles became famous because he could play blues, rock and jazz. He also liked other kinds of music. He told the record company officials that he wanted to record an album   of country and western music.\nThe president of the record company told him it would be a mistake. He said Ray's fans would not buy the album. Charles disagreed. He said he believed he would gain many new fans to replace the few he might lose. He produced the album and it was an immediate success.\nThe album was called Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music. Many of the songs sold very well. One of the most popular songs was I Can't Stop Loving You. It is a countryandwestern song with Ray Charles' sound of blues and black church music.",
