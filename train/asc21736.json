  "article": "In my country, daily  meals usually start with breakfast. People usually have something to drink for breakfast, like tea with sugar and lemon, cold or warm milk or Coke. Many people have some bread, egg, hamburgers and so on. We must always remember that breakfast must be healthy and light.\nThe noon is lunchtime, many people take their meals to schools or their workplaces, but some people like going to a restaurant or having fast food in McDonald's. I think that these meals are not healthy. We can have some rice with some vegetables or meat. More healthy fish and poultry  slowly _ beef and pork. It's healthy to drink one glass of water, juice or tea after each meal.\nAt six or seven in the evening, it's time for dinner. At this time, family members usually get together. We often have warm dishes. Sometimes we go out to restaurants.",
