  "article": "Learning to play a musical instrument can change your brain, with a US review finding musical training can lead to improved speech and foreign language skills.\nAlthough it was suggested in the past that listening to Mozart's music or other classical music could make you smarter, there has been little evidence to show that music can boost  brain power.\nBut a data-driven review by Northwestern University has pulled reaserch together that links musical training to learning that spills over into   skills including language, speech, memory, attention and even vocal emotion.\nResearcher Nina Kraus said the data strongly suggested that the nervous connections made during musical training also prepared the brain for other aspects of human communication.\n\" The effect of musical training suggests that, like physical exercise and its effect on body fitness, music is a resource that tones the brain for _ fitness and thus requires society to re-examine the role of music in shaping individual development, \" the researchers said in their study.\nKraus said learning musical sounds could improve the brain's ability to adapt and change and also enable the nervous system to provide constructing patterns that are important to learning.\nThe study, published in Nature Review Neuroscience , looked at the explosion of research in recent years focusing on the effect of musical training on the nervous system which could have impacts for education.\nThe study found that playing an instrument prepares the brain to choose what is related in a complex process that may involve reading or remembering a score, timing issues and coordination with other musicians.",
