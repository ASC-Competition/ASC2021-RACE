  "article": "Australian Flag Designs by Readers of the Sun-Herald\nWe received dozens of responses after inviting readers to send in their designs for a new flag. The designs we received include:\nJames Anthony, Drummoyne\nJames reduces the Union Jack down in size and changes its shape to become a reminder of the British tradition rather than canceling it altogether. At the same time he suggests enlarging the stars of the Southern Cross. His design attempts to use the best of both worlds in a newly designed flag.\nAs he says, \"the British part of the Australian Flag is too big and the Australian bits are too small. When you make the stars bigger the Australian flag can look impressive.\"\nJoe Bollen, Turranmurra\nJoe's flag has the main elements of a risen sun, white horizon , red earth at the base and the Southern Cross. He intends to make the risen sun a special Australian symbol on the flag. He believes it represents life. The Southern Cross shows that we live in the Southern Hemisphere.  \nMaria Ieraci, Sydney\nMaria deleted the Union Jack but otherwise kept the flag as is with the Southern Cross and Federation Star. She says, 'There is only one correct way to change the Australian flag\" and that is \"to drop the Union Jack ---- when Australia becomes a Republic\", which she hopes will be before 2010.\nRon Bennett, Sydney\nRon recommends using the Aboriginal colors but replacing their image of the sun with the map of Australia. He says, \"Australia is unique being an island continent with an instantly recognizable outline at that\" and \"this will leave no doubt as to which country the flag belongs.\"",
