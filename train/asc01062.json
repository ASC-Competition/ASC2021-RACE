  "article": "As A/H1N1 continues to spread, experts from the Centers for Disease Control to the World Health Organization to neighborhood doctors are calling on the people to practice smart flu prevention techniques. Here are some tips to keep body improved and immune system ready to fight infection.\nWash Your Hands\nAnd wash them often, in hot soapy water, and for the amount of time it takes you to sing \"Happy Birthday\" twice.\nGet Enough Sleep\nThis means slightly different things to different people, but try to get 8 hours of good rest each night to keep your immune system in top flu-fighting shape.\nKeep Hydrated\nDrink enough water each day to clear poisonous matter from your system and keep up good moisture production in your body.\nEat Immune-Improving Foods\nKeeping you body strong and ready to fight infection is important in flu prevention. Fatty foods can slow your metabolism , make you feel inactive, and weaken your immune\nsystem. So stick with whole grains, colorful vegetables, and vitamin-rich fruits.\nAvoid Alcohol\nAlcohol is likely to decrease your resistance to infections and further damages the immune system. So avoid alcoholic drinks to keep your immune system strong.\n--------------------------?\nProper exercise-for example walking for 30-40 minutes 3-4 times a week-supports the immune system by increasing circulation, oxygenating the body, removing poisonous material through sweat, and reducing tension and stress. So get moving!\nAvoid Contact with Sick People\nIf you're coughing or sneezing, cover your mouth(and then wash your hands),and if you have to be around someone who is sick, try to stay a few feet away from them and avoid physical contact.\nKnow When to Get Help\nA/H1N1 can look like regular flu, so don't feel like you necessarily are infected if you're exhibiting flu-like symptoms . But do go to your doctor if you live in an area where there are recorded cases, or if your symptoms are very serious.",
