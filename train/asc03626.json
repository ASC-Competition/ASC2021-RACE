  "article": "Saturday, March 24th\nWe have arrived in the hot, wet city of Bangkok. This is our first trip toThailand . All the different smells make us want to try the food. We aregoing to eat something special for dinner tonight. The hotel we are staying in is\ncheap, and very clean. We plan to stay here for a few days, visit some places in\nthe city, and then travel to Chiang Mai in the North.\nTuesday, March 27th\nBangkok is wonderful and surprising! The places are interesting. We visited\nthe famous market which was on water, and saw a lot of fruits and vegetables.\nEverything is so colorful, and we have taken hundreds of photos already! Later\ntoday we will leave for Chiang Mai. We will take the train north, stay in\nChiang Mai for two days, and then catch a bus to Chiang Rai.\nFriday, March 30th\nOur trip to Chiang Rai was long and boring. We visited a small village in\nthe mountains. The village people here love the quiet life-no computers or\nphones. They are the kindest people I have ever met. They always smile and say\n\"hello\". Kathy and I can only speak a few words of Thai, so smiling is the best\nway to show our kindness. I feel good here and hope to be able to come back\nnext year.",
