  "article": "Thanksgiving Day was near. The first grade teacher gave her class some fun homework---to draw a picture of something for which they were thankful.\nMost of the class drew a turkey or other traditional things. But Douglas drew a different kind of picture. He drew a hand. Just an empty  hand.\nDouglas was a different boy. He was poor and unhappy. As other children played, Douglas was likely to stand close by the teacher's side.\nHis classmates were surprised at his picture. One child guessed it was the hand of a farmer, because farmers _ turkeys. Others guessed it was the hand of God, for God feeds us.\nThe teacher asked him whose hand it was. The little boy said in a low voice, \"It's yours.\"\nShe remembered the times she had taken his hand and walked with him here and there, as she had the other students. How often she said, \"Take my hand, Douglas, we'll go outside.\" Or, \"Let me show you how to hold your pencil.\" Or, \"Let's do this together.\" Douglas was most thankful for his teacher's hand.\nTears came into the teacher's eyes.",
