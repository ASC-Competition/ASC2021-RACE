  "article": "Remind children that bad things don't last. It may sound simple, but the message is extremely important. \"Children often don't have the experience to know that when something bad happens---they lose an important game or their best friend lets them down---it's not the end of the world,\" explains Nancy Leffert, a senior research scientist with the Research Institute, an American adolescents  and children's research group. \"They think their bad feelings will last for ever, or that one failure will ruin everything.\"\nUnfortunately, that kind of thinking discourages motivation . \"If a child believes that the cause of her upset is lasting, or that nothing she does will make a difference, it decreases her ability to keep on trying.\" says Dorothy Rich, president of the MegaSkills Education Center of the Home and School Institute, based in Washington. Any time you can help your child see that a situation is not lasting, that a result can be changed, or that one opinion does not reflect reality, you give her reason to hope.\nCase in point: \"When my daughter Kathy was eight, art was one of her favorite subjects,\" says Beth, a mother of two. \"Then she got an art teacher who gave a great deal of praise to one student and barely noticed the rest. Kathy was ready to give up until I explained to her, \"Never stop doing your best just because one person doesn't give you praise.\" Beth had to repeat the advice often, and finally her daughter got the message. \"Kathy is 12 now, and art is still one of her strongest subjects.\"",
