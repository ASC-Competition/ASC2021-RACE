  "article": "At first all films were in black and white, but in 1932 the first color film was made. It proved as unpopular as making films had done in the late 1920's. It was not until 1938 that a full length color film was made, and the success of this film made producers  everywhere change from black and white to color. This first full-length color film was translated  into ten different languages and made Hollywood the main center( )of film industry \nIn the early days of the cinema, other countries had also film industries. Very good films were made in Sweden, Britain, Russia and France. However, because Holleywood had so much money to spend, it kept its position as the world's most important film center. Film actors went to America because they knew they could get a lot of money for every film they made. In 1918 Charlie Chaplin (*)received $5 each day.\nHowever, life was not always easy for the film actors. Newspapermen followed them everywhere, and after Charlie Chapine married for the fourth time he became so unpopular with the American public that he had to leave the country and live in Europe.",
