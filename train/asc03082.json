  "article": "The first Ml choir rehearsal of the school year took place in the school hall. All the students joined together to sing. I watched as my elder sister and her grade came in and took their places next to us on the stage. Meanwhile, I could hear laughing. Some students were pointing at a girl standing next to my sister. I'd never seen this girl before. A girl whispered in my ear, \" Did you know she's wearing diapers ?\"\nAfter school that evening, I asked my sister about the girl I'd seen. She told me her name was Theresa and that she was a very nice girL .\" Why were those kids being mean to her? I asked, \"Because they're stupid,\" she said.\nOne day, I was walking home from school when I heard voices behind me. \"There's the little idiot's  sister. Does your sister wet her pants too?\" I walked a little faster and then I felt a atone hit me in the back. When I got home, I ran down to my sister's room.\nI pushed my way into her room, screaming at her. \"Why do you have to be that giri's friend? I don't see anyone else being nice to her, \" Janelle yelled back, Because she is a wonderful person and she is dying!\" I will remember those words as long as I live. Theresa wet her pants because she had an illness, which was killing her. My sister was the only one nice enough to be her friend and stick up for her. A few months later, Hieresa passed away.\nI felt proud that Janelle was my sister. Throughout the years I watched her, and she always made friends with everyone. It didn't matter if they ware fat, thin, brilliant or not. She  never left anyone feeling isolated or alone. It was she who changed me  and   taught me to never  look at anyone in the same way again.",
