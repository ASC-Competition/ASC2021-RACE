  "article": "Do you have a lucky number? What is it? Many people have a special number that they hope will bring them good luck.\nIn Chinese culture, some numbers are believed to be lucky or unlucky based on the Chinese word that the number sounds similar to.\nFor example, the word for the number 8 sounds similar to the word for \"making a fortune \". So, people consider it a very lucky number. Some people will even spend a lot of money to have 8s in their phone numbers or vehicle license plate   numbers. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics began at 8:08 p.m. on August 8, 2008.\nThe number 9 is also a lucky number because of its connection to the emperors of China. There were nine dragons on emperors' robes   and Chinese myth held that the dragon has nine children. The number 9 also stands for \"long lasting\". That's why a man always proposes to(---)a woman with 99 or 999 roses.\nSo what's a \"bad luck\" number in China? It might be 4. Many Chinese people see 4 as a \"bad luck\" number because it sounds similar to the character for \"death\".\nBecause of this, many buildings skip  the fourth floor, and simply call it the fifth floor. In Hong Kong, some buildings even skip all floors numbered with 4, such as, 4, 14, 24, 34 and all 40-49 floors. Some buildings also skip the 13th floor, as this is considered an unlucky number in many Christian countries. As a result, a building whose highest floor is 50 may have only 35 physical floors.",
