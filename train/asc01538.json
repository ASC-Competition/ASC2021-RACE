  "article": "It is not a good idea to stop the actor Richard Griffiths in the middle of a play.During the past year he has stopped performances many times at the National Theatre when mobile phones rang, and he threw out one member of the audience because she failed to turn off her phone.\nSo when a mobile rang out for the third time during his performance in Alan Bennett's The History Boys, he spoke angrily to the theatergoer  , \"I am not going to compete with these electronic devices  .\"\nGriffiths' actions led to a debate in the UK theatre world over whether phones should be forbidden by law from British theatres, too.Actors have already asked the government to legalise   the use of an electronic device that stops mobile phone signals in theatres.\nTechnology companies have \"stopping\" devices that send out a high-powered signal on the same frequency   as a mobile phone, stopping the mobile phone signal.\nHowever, these are forbidden in many countries because they might stop emergency calls from being made.\nRosemary Squire, president of the Society of West End Theatre, said, \"Phones are one of the biggest problems theatres face.We should look at equipment that could stop phones or make a London-wide theatre rule.\"\nNick Allott, the managing director of Sir Cameron Mackintosh's theatre group, said, \"We would all welcome some ways of stopping ringing phones but doctors and emergency workers need to be connected in a theatre and we mustn't stop that.\" What can we do to solve the problem?",
