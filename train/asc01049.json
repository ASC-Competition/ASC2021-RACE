  "article": "If you want to increase your vocabulary, the best way to do it might be to pick up a guitar, or learn the violin. A new study shows that learning to play a musical instrument makes the brain more able to remember words.\n\"Grown-ups with music training in their childhood can have better memory for words,\" said Dr Agnes Chan of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who did the research. \"They can remember things that you tell them better than those who did not have music training when they were young.\"\nIt seems that one can remember spoken words because his brain has a special part. \"That part of the brain is larger in musicians than in non-musicians,\" Dr Chan told BBC. \"If that part of the brain is larger, it may be better developed and so this explains very nicely our results.\"\nDr Chan and her workmates came to their conclusion after studying students. Their research is reported in the latest edition of the journal  Nature. \"We did the experiment with 60 girl college students from our university and 30 of them have at least six years training with one western musical instrument (such as the violin and the piano) before the age of 12. The other 30 had received no music training. We tested their memory by reading them some words and asking them to remember these words--a very common test for memory. We found that people who have had music training can remember about 70% more information than those who have not had any music training.\"\nDr Chan thinks the process  of learning is more important than the actual instrument used. She also believes if one is able to remember words through learning to play instruments, he or she could have some very real benefits. Dr Chan thinks this could be developed into a medical way for patients who are suffering from memory loss.",
