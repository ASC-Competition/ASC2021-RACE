  "article": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is America's fifth largest city. Once a major American colonial city, it is the home of America's first library, its first hospital, and its first zoo. Now it is also the first US city to be named a World Heritage City. On November 6, 2015, Philadelphia joined more than 260 other cities that have been recognized for their influence on the world. These cities include Paris, France, Florence, Italy, and Cairo, Egypt.\n\"Today marks the start of a new and exciting chapter in the history of Philadelphia,\" remarked Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter when the announcement was made. \"As a World Heritage City, Philadelphia is being officially recognized on the global stage for its wealth of contributions to the world.\nTo be named a World Heritage City, a city must be home to a UNESCO World Heritage site. UNESCO World Heritage sites are selected for their universal value and significance. For Philadelphia, the site is Independence Hall.\nIndependence Hall is where two of the most important documents in US history--the Declaration of Independenceand theUS Constitution--were adopted. TheDeclaration of Independence, approved on July 4, 1776, united the 13 former British colonies and declared them independent from British rule. TheUS Constitution, signed in 1787, established the American democratic system of government. A democracy is a system of government in which the people elect their leaders. TheConstitutionlater spelled out the basic freedoms American citizens have.\nPhiladelphia Deputy Mayor Alan Greenberger says the city's selection as a World Heritage City also reflects its educational, cultural, and economic achievements. The city is home to dozens of colleges and universities, and many museums, such as the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \"Philadelphia has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest cities in the world.\" Greenberger says.",
