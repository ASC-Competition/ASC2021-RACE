  "article": "I arrived home late one night last week. I spent a moment looking up into the night sky. The stars above shone  brightly. The sky looked really beautiful.\nI started to think about other things as I stared at the night sky. It hit me clearly that these beautiful stars were always there but I had spent very little time in the past really appreciating them. It also reminded me that we often think we deserve many things around us, being too caught up in our own little world. It is a world filled with busy work and the demands placed on us from what we have allowed to take up our time.\nRecently, I was asked to repair a house for a family member. When I arrived, it seemed like any other day when I spent my time doing something I knew how to do. But there was something else that came to mind as I started to work with my son-in-law. I considered it a good opportunity. The opportunity was more than just spending time repairing a house. It was an opportunity to further a bond between two people who are related by marriage but are unrelated through few experiences. It was an opportunity to build a stronger bond, a bond that can only happen when two people are exposed  to each other's skills and faults. It was also an opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with another who wanted to learn.\nThere are many chances to see beyond what is viewed as normal, but we must be able to actually open our eyes and heart to these events and appreciate them. To be in tune with what is around you, you must use the attitude of a child who screams with joy the first time they see a rainbow, hear the pretty song of a bird, or enjoy the beauty of Christmas decorations.",
