It is a fun festival. People carry lanterns and go into the streets at night to watch lion or dragon dances, play games and light firecrackers.

On the first day of the New Year, Tibetan women usually wake up early at about 5 o'clock, and prepare for a special kind of barley wine for the family which have tsamba, brown sugar, and milk dregs. The whole family have to drink the wine in their beds and then continue to sleep, while the housewives sit in front of their windows, waiting for the sunrise. As soon as they see the sun rays in the east, they go to the well for the first bucket of water in the New Year. It is said that water in the well is the freshest and sweetest at this time and the family who get the lucky water earliest will be the most fortunate.",
