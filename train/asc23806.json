  "article": "Dear Frank,\nThank you for your email. I'm very glad you are having a good trip now. Ottawa is very beautiful in May. I hope I can have a chance  to go there one day. Our summer holiday will start next month. I like my summer holiday, although it's hot at that time in America. In summer holiday, I can swim in the sea and go fishing. It's so cool. And I am going to our hometown near Chicago with my sister, Linda, and my parents agree .Our uncle lives there, so Linda and I can stay with him. We are not going to take a plane. We are going there by train. I am going to fish there. And Linda likes painting. She is going to do some painting there. I'm sure we'll have a good time.\nSincerely,\nJack",
