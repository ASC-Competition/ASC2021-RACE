  "article": "We all see and hear about extraordinary  people around us and wonder why we can't be more like them. It's not the big things that make someone extraordinary. It's the small things. They become extraordinary by making a difference in someone's life. Here are some of the things extraordinary people do every day:\nPraise someone. It can make the others feel great about themselves. A compliment can have a positive impact  on their lives. Your team or family will love you for it.\nIt's OK to admit  you were wrong. You will not only gain the respect of your team mates, but you will also gain credibility .\nWhen you need help, don't be shy or stop yourself. Everyone needs a little help sometimes. When you ask for help, you receive help. You're willing to listen; you also need support at times.\nWhen you don't understand how something works, let an expert show you. When you let someone teach you something, you are telling the person that you respect his talent, time and what he is talking about.\nSometimes it is very important to stay silent. Especially when you're angry, process your emotions, think back to what happened, and then come to a decision about how to deal with it. Before you say anything, consider others' feeling. Never be rude with words or actions.",
