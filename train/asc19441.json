  "article": "Americans are very direct people. When they want something, they say\"Yes\", and when they don't, they say \"No\".If they want something different from what is given, they ask for it.  Here's an example : I arrive at someone's house and he or she gives me wine, but I don't want wine. Maybe I don't like it or maybe I just don't want it. I will say \"No thanks\". If everyone around me is drinking something, I would ask  for something else,\"No thanks. But I'll take a bit of tea if you have some.\" It's a polite way to ask something you really want. If I really want wine, I just say \"Yes, thank you\". Unless they happen know the Chinese customs(;), _ will not ask you again and again after you to eat or drink something.\n,,. (10)",
