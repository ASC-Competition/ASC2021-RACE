  "article": "One day Mrs Wilson took Trudy and Ben to go shopping. They went to the supermarket in the new shopping mall . \"Why do you buy things here, Mum?\" Trudy asked.  \"Because they are cheaper than those at the corner store,\" Mrs Wilson said. \"Help me check  the prices.\" The Wilsons were not wealthy  and Mrs Wilson was always careful with her money. She looked carefully at the prices of things. She bought some groceries  in the supermarket. When they got home, the children said, \"We don't think you saved  money by going to the supermarket there.\" \"Of course I did,\" said Mrs Wilson, \"everything was cheap there.\" \"We know,\" said the children, \"but we came home by taxi  because we had too much to carry. The cost  of the taxi was more than the money you saved!\" Mrs Wilson added  everything up and found her children were right. \"Well done,\"she said, \"next time we will do shopping near our home.\"",
