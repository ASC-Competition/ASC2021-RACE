  "article": "Recently, an Internet game has become a new fashion among young office workers and students. People can \"farm\" on a piece of \"land\" and \"grow\", \"sell\" or even \"steal vegetables\", \"flowers\" and \"fruits\" on the Net. They can earn some e-money and buy more \"seeds\", \"pets\" and even \"houses\".\nJoyce interviewed some young people. Here are their opinions:\nHarold: I don't quite understand why they are so mad about the childish game. Maybe they are just not confident enough to face the real world.\nAllan: I enjoy putting some \"bugs\" in my friends' gardens and we've become closer because of the game. Having fun together is the most exciting thing about it.\nLaura: You know, people in the city are longing for the life in the countryside. It reduces my work pressure . Besides, it gives me the exciting experience of being a \"thief\".\nIvy: Well, it's just a waste of time. Teenagers playing the game spend so many hours on it that they can not focus on  their study.",
