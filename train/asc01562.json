  "article": "A trip to the library can change your life.That is the idea of the Get It Loud in Libraries project,which challenges the habit of speaking in a low voice.The sweet tones of singer Diana Vickers rang out recently,surrounded by books as well as fans,at Lancaster Library.Plan B,Adele,Florence and the Machine,Speech Debelle,and the Thrills have also performed for the project.\nThis fiveyear project aims to increase access  to libraries while developing youth talent and has attracted more than 8,500 visitors,5,000 of whom are firsttime library users.\n\"I think it's wonderful,\"Vickers says.\"I've been playing in front of big crowds and I'm excited about close environments where you can be close to your fans.\"\nAs a child growing up in nearby Blackburn,she says that her school library was a \"second home\"to her.When she was young she lovedPeterRabbitandMr.Menbooks,and later her favorites includedLittleWomenandTheLovelyBones.\nAttracted by the stage,the young who would once never have been to a library have been returning to borrow books and CDs.The project's founder,Stewart Parsons,has worked in libraries for 25 years.He feels that the concerts have made libraries something that the young want to be part of.A mother,Lauren Zawadzki,sent him a text message after a concert:\"Your work is great!!!Both Izaak and Dom have been reading in the library for the last half hour...You should be proud.They would never have suggested that before the concerts.\"\nParsons hopes that the activity is changing the way people view libraries.\"My big worry is that libraries trail behind slightly;they shouldn't.This is about bringing libraries up to date.The beautiful thing is that people are reconnecting with the library in a way they haven't done before.\"",
