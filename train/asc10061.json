  "article": "On Monday night, back on the way home from school, I was suddenly faced with a big snow storm which I had never met before. The traffic was moving at 5 mph on the freeway where it usually requires at least 60 mph. The road is very slippery. Sometimes the car is out of control, slipping to the other side. I finally managed to drive to the Issaquah. However, I still got stuck in the traffic on an uphill way to my home. Why I lived in the house on the top of the hill? I had no choice but left my car in the road. Fortunately, there was a nice guy coming to help me drive the car to the parking lot so that I would not get a ticket from the policeman. When he first opened my car door and asked me if I needed any help, I thought I saw an angle. No kidding, I was totally frustrated at that moment until I saw the guy.\nAfter waiting in the parking lot for almost 3 hours, my husband's cousin finally managed to come to \"rescue\" me by his four-wheel drive car and sent me to my in-laws' home because the road to my house was closed. When I got to my bed in the end, it was over midnight. I spent almost 5 hours outside instead of 20 minutes as usual. But I was lucky, because I knew later that some people spent 7 or 10 hours to go home, and just by walking rather than by driving.\nThis strong snow storm has messed up the traffic of Seattle and I get an unforgettable experience from it.",
