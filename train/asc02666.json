  "article": "The US plans to extend its endangered species protection to lions in Africa. US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) will classify lions in southern and eastern Africa as threatened. The move will place tighter restrictions on the import of lion \"trophies \", such as paws or heads.\nWhile the US cannot regulate hunting in other countries the move is significant because around half of all lion hunting in Africa is conducted by Americans. According to FWS data, more than 5, 600 lions have been killed and imported by American hunters over the past decade.\nUnder the new FWS rules, bringing lion parts to the US will be banned  in most circumstances if the animal is from a country where lions are endangered. Hunters will have to show the trophies were \"legally obtained\" from countries that have a scientifically sound management program that benefits the subspecies in the wild.\nThis regulation is expected to place a far greater burden of proof upon hunters who claim that the money from lion hunting has been used to help communities in Africa and the overall conservation of lions. The persistent downward trend in lion numbers, due to habitat loss and hunting by locals and foreign tourists, suggests there has been little conservation  benefit from organized hunts.\nAn international study, published in September, found African lion numbers have decreased by half since 1993, with a further 50% decline expected over the next 20 years for populations in west, central and east Africa.\n\"The lion is one of the planet's most beloved species and an irreplaceable part of our shared global heritage,\" said Dan Ashe, director of the FWS. \"If we want to ensure that healthy lion populations continue to wander around the African savannas  and forests of India, it's up to all of us--not just the people of Africa and India--to take action.\"",
