  "article": "When someone told 85-year-old Johnny Long that he was called a living legend, he replied, \"I don't know about that, but I'm living, and that's important.\"\nStarting in 1949 as a high school band director and later as director of the Troy University band, Johnny Long became known as one of the most inspirational band directors in America. More than three hundred of his students went on to become band directors them-selves. \"I have been a band director for more than 60 years and all I know about the word band is that you spell it F-U-N,\" Long said. \"And if you change that, it's over.\"\nLong retired 14 years ago to spend more time with his wife Mary Lynn. But his passion   for bands never went away. He dreamed of forming a top-notch   community band in Troy. But Troy is a small town -- with not a ton of top-notch talent. \"I didn't think it would work, I really didn't,\" Long said.\nFortunately, there was one thing Johnny hadn't considered: the devotion of his former students. Now, once a week during the concert season, they drive in from all over the south and across the decades.\n65-year-old Bobby Johnson was in Long's first college class. He lives in Atlanta and drives 3 hours to practice. Johnson said he does it because Long's \"such a unique character and I just admire him so much.\"\nMany people do it for the same reason. \"He's the single biggest influence on my career.\" \"He was a father figure to me. He's just a genuine person.\"\nLong said he wanted to be remembered as a teacher. \"I think 'teacher' is the greatest word in the English language, next to 'mother'.\"",
