  "article": "A newspaper, a publication usually issued on a daily or weekly basis, has the main function of reporting news. Many newspapers also _ their readers with other pieces of useful information, such as weather reports, television schedules, and stock prices. They provide commentary   on politics, economics, and arts and culture. In nearly all cases and in varying degrees, newspapers depend on commercial advertising for their income.\nNewspaper publishers estimate that nearly six out of ten adults in the United States and Canada read a newspaper every day, and seven out of ten read a paper each weekend. By the time they see a newspaper; most people have already heard about breaking news stories on television or on the radio. Readers rely on newspapers to provide detailed background information and analysis   which television and radio rarely offer. Newspapers not only inform readers that an event has happened but also help readers understand what led to the event and how it will affect the world.\nThe staff of a large newspaper works under the constant pressure of deadlines to bring news to readers as quickly as their minds, bodies and the technology they use permit. Reporters, photographers, artists, and editors compile   articles and graphics -- sometimes in just a few hours. Page designers combine articles, photos, advertisements, and eye-catching headlines into page layouts  , then rush their work to the printer. Printing technicians may work through the night operating printing presses that can print out more than 60,000 copies per hour.",
