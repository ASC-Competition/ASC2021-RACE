  "article": "Last summer I was lucky enough to participate in a volunteer adventure to Kenya, in association with Virgin Atlantic's Be the Change programme and children's charity, Free the Children. The moment I read the e-mail saying that I had been accepted into Free the Children's Virgin Atlantic scholarship trip to Kenya, I had no idea how much it was going to change my life. I thought the trip would be a great way to learn about life in one of the most rural areas of Kenya, but I never thought about how deeply I might be affected by this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\nWhen we entered the Masai Mara, the first thing that struck me was how unbelievably beautiful it was. As I looked closer to it, I realized there was something even more beautiful: the people. I have never been to a place where the saying \"the people are what make the place\" was more true.\nThe way they wave at you excitedly as you drive past, shouting \"Jambo, Jambo!\" is something that I have never experienced. They are always smiling and welcoming and it made me realize that, if everyone were to act like this, the world would be a much happier place.\nThe most amazing thing about the trip was that we weren't treated like tourists for one second. We were able to experience every little detail. We built foundations, carried ten litres of water...\nThe one thing I will never forget is visiting Emorijoi Primary School. Let me describe it like this: As soon as you entered into the gate, you would hear someone shouting your name. Then you looked around and realized that it was the same little girl that you were playing football with the last time you visited.\nThere are literally no words to explain how much I miss Kenya. It feels like there is a piece of string attaching me to everyone that I met there. They will stay with me forever and always be in my heart.",
