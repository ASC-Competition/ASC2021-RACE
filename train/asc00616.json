  "article": "JK Rowling, the Harry Potter author, has signed a deal with Little, Brown and Company, to publish her first ever novel for adults, which is set to become one of the most anticipated   book in years.\nThe deal means that Rowling's long-standing relationship with Bloomsbury, the London-based publisher that launched   the Harry Potter books, has come to an end, at least in terms of new works by the author.\nRowling is keeping her fans guessing about the characters and plot of her new book. She only said that the new novel will be nothing like the Harry Potter series, which was sold over 30 million copies in the UK alone. She thought that with the move from children's to adult fiction, a switch to a new publisher seemed like a natural and reasonable step.\nShe said, \"Although I've enjoyed writing it every bit as much, this book will be very different from the Harry Potter series. The freedom to explore a new field is a gift that Harry's success has brought me.\"\nIan Rankin, the Edinburgh-based author whose highly-successful detective novels are also set in the city, suggested Rowling's book will be a crime novel.\n\"Wouldn't it be funny if JK Rowling's first novel for adults turned out to be a crime story set in Edinburgh?\" he said.\nIndustry insiders guessed that the deal is worth more than PS5 million and the new book is expected to come out later this year.\nA spokesman said, \"JK Rowling's audience is vast and her position is unique. Harry Potter books were a global success and her fans are very loyal. Children that were eight, nine, or ten when the books first came out in the 1990s are now in their 20s. Plenty of adults, loved the books regardless of whether they had children, so the potential market for her is huge.\"",
