  "article": "There are many people who say Thomas Edison invented the twentieth century. Although there are those who may disagree, yet Edison was one of the greatest inventors in America.\nBorn in 1847 in Ohio, Thomas Edison attended school for only three months. After his teacher said that he could not learn, Edison's mother decided to teach him at home. There he was allowed to study the subjects that most interested him. By age ten, Edison had built a science laboratory of his own.\nEdison got his first job at age twelve on the railway selling candy and newspapers. There he once saved a boy whose father was the boss of the railway station. In return the boss helped him a lot.\nIn his late twenties, Edison built an \"invention factory\" where he and his business partners could devote all their time to inventing. After improving upon the telephone, Edison created the phonograph . Although Edison did not actually invent the light bulb, he did create an electric lighting system which led to its widespread use.\nEdison set up the first central electric power station in 1882, so New York became the first city in the world to have electric lights. This was the beginning of the modern world in which electricity became a way of life.\nThe following year, one of Edison's engineers discovered electrons , which at last led to electronics. Without electronics, we might not have radio, TV, computers, or space travel. The rest of Edison's life was spent making and improving inventions.\nThomas Edison died at the age of eighty-four in 1931. Three days later, much of America dimmed  its lights in honor of the inventor--a man who had more impact  on the development of present-day civilization than anyone else in history.",
