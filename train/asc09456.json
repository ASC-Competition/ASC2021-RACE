As soon as he got home on Fridays ,his wife used to make him give her all his money, and then she used to give him back only enough to buy his lunch in the office every day. One day the small man came home very excited. He hurried into the living-room. His wife was listening to the radio and eating chocolates there.\n\"You will never guess what happened to me today, dear.\" he said.\nHe waited for a few seconds and then added, \"I won ten thousand pounds on the lottery!\"\n\"That's wonderful!\" said his wife happily.
