  "article": "Bob was a clever college student, but his family was poor, so he had to work after class and during his holidays to get enough money for his studies.\nOne summer he got a job in a butcher's shop   during the day time, and another in a hospital at night. In the shop, he learned to cut and sell meat. He did so well that the butcher went into a room behind the shop to do all the accounts ( ) .In the hospital, of course, Bob was told to do only the easiest jobs. He helped to lift people and carry them from one part of the hospital to another. Both in the butcher's shop and in the hospital, Bob had to wear white clothes.\nOne evening in the hospital, Bob had to help to carry a woman from her bed to the operating - room. The woman already felt frightened when she thought about the operation. When she saw Bob coming to get her, she felt even more frightened.\n\"No! No!\" she cried. \"Not a butcher! I won't let a butcher operate on me!\" with these words ,she fainted away.",
