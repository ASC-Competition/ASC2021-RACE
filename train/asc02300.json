  "article": "Homonym: a word that has the same spelling and the same pronunciation as another world, but a different meaning\nSame spelling, different meaning\nImagine, then a situation where two words are spelt and pronounced exactly the same way, but have completely different meanings.Welcome to the world of homonyms.Take, for example, the word 'fail' --- it can be a kind of festival, and adjective to describe the color of your hair or how you should play a game.\nDon't take it literally\nSo how do you know which meaning someone is referring to? --- You don't, except by the context.Obviously, if someone asks you to 'give them a hand', they don't want you to remove what is at the end of your arm.\nWhat's in a name?\nSometimes even the context doesn't help much --- the result can be amusing.These sentences play with the double meaning of a noun:\nI used to be a banker, but I lost interest.\nHave you heard about the cross-eyed teacher who couldn't control his pupils?\nA small boy swallowed some coins and had to go to hospital.When his grandmother phoned to ask how he was, the nurse said: 'No change yet'.\nMore ambiguity\nAnd these examples play with the different meanings of a verb:\nI wondered why the ball was getting bigger.Then it hit me.\nNo one knew she had a dental implant until it came out in a conversation.\nA boiled egg in the morning is hard to beat.\nDouble trouble\nAnd sometimes a word can be a noun and a verb, but have different meanings.Can you work this one out?\nTime flies like an arrow.Fruit flies like a banana.\nIf you like these homonyms, you will be pleased to know that English has plenty more!\nExplanations of jokes in the text\nI used to be banker, but I lost interest.(I became bored with the job / I lost money)\nHave you heard about the cross-eyed teacher who couldn't control his pupils? (students / parts of his eyes)\nA small boy swallowed some coins and had to go to hospital.When his grandmother phoned to ask how he was, the nurse said: 'No change yet'.(no difference in the situation / no money)\nI wondered why the ball was getting bigger.Then it hit me.(the ball hit me / I suddenly realized)\nNo one knew she had a dental implant until it came out in a conversation.(became known / fell out)\nA boiled egg in the morning is hard to beat.(can't be better / difficult to mix with a fork)\nTime flies like an arrow.(time goes quickly) Fruit flies like a banana.(insects enjoy eating fruit.)",
