  "article": "Lilian Hanson, a college student, expects to graduate in about two years. What makes Mrs Hanson different from her classmates is her age -- 73 years. She has been studying at college, a few courses at a time, for 27 years.\nWhen Lilian Hanson graduated from high school, she went to the bank to borrow money for further education. The banker gave her no encouragement. He didn't think that a country girl should borrow money to go to college. He thought she should be at home doing work in the house or around the farm. So Lilian Hanson went home and raised a family of nine children instead of going to college.\nMrs Hanson never forgot her dream of getting a higher education. When her children were grown, she tried again. She finds the hardest part of going back to school at her age is the sitting in class for long periods of time. Because she is not as flexible  as she used to be, Mrs Hanson often gets up and walks around between classes to keep from getting stiff . At the beginning of a course in using the computer, the other students all stood and gave her a warm welcome when she introduced herself and explained why she was there and what her aims were.",
