  "article": "\"Fingers were made before forks.\" When a person gives up good manners, put aside knife and fork, and dives into his food, someone is likely to repeat that saying.\nThe fork was an ancient agricultural tool, but for centuries no one thought of eating with it. Not until the eleventh century, when a young lady from Constantinople brought her fork to Italy, did the custom reach Europe.\nBy the fifteenth century the use of the fork was wide-spread in Italy. The English explanation was that Italians were unwilling to eat food touched with fingers, \"seeing all men's fingers are not alike clean.\nAnyone who used a fork to eat with was laughed at in England for the next hundred years. Not until the late 1600's did using a fork become a common custom.",
