  "article": "At times my mom has been uncomfortable seeing these qualities in me. For example,when I was 12,I went to Puerto Rico all by myself to stay with my grandmother for the summer. My mom was extremely nervous about it. She kept telling me how things were different in Puerto Rico,to always put on sunscreen,not to wander away from my grandmother,and other warnings. She helped me pack and did not leave the airport until she saw my plane take off.\nBut despite her worries,she let me go on my own. As I moved into my teens,she continued to give me space to grow and learn,even when it might have been difficult for her. When I reached my senior year,I decided to move away for college. Once again I found that I differed from my peers:While many of them wanted to stay close to home,I couldn't wait to be out in the world on my own. While my mom may not have been happy at the thought of my going away,she was supportive and excited for me.\nOne big thing I realized during my senior year,as my mom granted me more freedom,was that she actually believes in me and trusts me. That means a lot. Most of my life,and especially when I was little,the main person I tried to impress in my schoolwork or other things was my mother. I knew she expected nothing but the best from me. Sometimes it was hard to live up to her standards;getting a single B on my report card would make me feel bad because I knew she wanted me to have all A's.\nI know that her high standards have helped me stay focused on what's important,like education,and made me who I am. I am thankful for her support and involvement in my life .Most of all I respect her. She is the strongest woman I know and that's why I have turned out so strong and independent.",
