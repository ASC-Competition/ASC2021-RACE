  "article": "Many smokers aren't finding the cost of cigarettes a laughing matter. The federal tax  on a pack jumped Wednesday -- April Fools' Day -- from 39 cents to $1.01. The tax increase is so big, it's being called \"historic.\"Higher federal taxes apply to  other tobacco products, so even those smokers who have taken to rolling their own to save money can't escape them. The tax is expected to cause about 1 million smokers to quit.\nNew York leads the pack, so to speak, with a combined $3.76. Any smokers planning to visit New York City should bring cigarettes from home. A pack there now costs more than $9.\nSome tobacco companies raised their prices several weeks ago.
