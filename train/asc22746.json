  "article": "French soccer player David Trezeguet holds the record for the fastest shot in a soccer match. It happened during a match between his club Juventus and England's Manchester United in 1998.\nAt that time, he was unknown outside of French soccer. But nine years later, Trezeguet, 29, has become one of the world's most famous strikers  .\nIn September, 2007, he scored his 100th goal in the Italian League. \"One hundred goals with Juventus, one of the greatest clubs in the world, that is important,\" he said.\nAlthough Trezeguet was born in France, he grew up in Argentina and he says his \" _ \" helped him become one of the world's best soccer players.\n\"Most people in Argentina have to work hard for everything they want,\" he explained. \"This mentality gave me a hunger and an ambition   to become the best.\"\nTrezeguet has had a great career. He has won nearly every major competition in soccer - the World Cup, the European Championships, the European Cup, as well as the French and Italian league titles.\nBut Trezeguet knows all about heartache too. In the French World Cup in 1998, after playing every match in the competition, he was not chosen to play in the final when France went on to win.\nThen in the 2006 World Cup in Germany, his miss in the penalty shoot-out  handed victory to Italy.  But Trezeguet refuses to let this get him down.\n\"I accept my responsibility. It's part of football,\" he said. \"You just have to move on and start thinking about focusing on the next thing.\"",
