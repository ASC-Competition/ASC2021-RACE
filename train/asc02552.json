  "article": "I look in the mirror, and I'm not happy with what I see. I don't have a \"perfect\" face. I look in the magazines and all I see are girls with fair hair, blue eyes, and, of course, a pretty little nose. They're on the outside of the buses that I take home, the television programs I watch, and the billboards  I walk under. Almost every advertisement I see shows this human physical \"perfection\". These billboards not only tell me what to drink, but also how to look.\nOur society place more importance on a person's physical beauty, rather than their ability, honesty and character. We have influenced women to go through painful surgeries and starve themselves to become this society built physical model. To be a beautiful woman in the 21st century doesn't mean that you are a brilliant doctor or caring mother. It means you have the perfect jaw, eyes and lips. It means that you can be six feet tall and weigh one hundred and ten pounds.\nBut what about the women who are starting to leave their youth? Instead of looking at aging as a sign of wisdom, we try to prevent the aging process . It's a kind of funny thing to want to look eighteen when fifty. Fifty is a relaxed age, when you can step back and look at all you've achieved (successfully complete something). It is when your hard work pays off. Unfortunately, our society just sees you as \"old\". To stop the aging process, women buy wrinkle  creams, do eye lifts and face lifts. They spend thousands of dollars to win the hopeless battle against age.\nI remember when I was about thirteen years old and going through teens, I had oily hair, and a half developed body. I hated the way I looked. I used to cry to my mother all the time, but she would just laugh and tell me that \"you don't want anyone to like your appearance. It's your heart that is important, because beauty fades. \" I knew that she was right. If you work on your heart enough, people will start to see the beauty in you, which lasts and remains on even after you die.",
