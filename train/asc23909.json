Try to help your teacher.\nMy classmates choose me as the PE monitor in our class because I run very fast. My PE teacher and my classmates like me. They also want me to _ the PE Club. I think that is a good idea. We can play basketball or football at weekends.\nPlease send some of your photos to me.\nYours,\nMike",
