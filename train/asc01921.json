  "article": "I had just gone to bed after a very hard day when the phone rang. It was a strange farmer. I had never met him before although I had heard people talk about him. He sounded quite nervous and he had been talking for a minute or so before I understood anything. Even then all I could understand was that someone called Milly had had an accident. I hadn't the slightest idea who she was but I obviously had to go.\nIt had been snowing heavily that day and I didn't know the way. I had been driving for at least an hour when I finally found his place. He was standing there, waiting for me. \"She meant more to me than anyone.even my own wife!\" he said. I could see that he had been crying. I thought something terrible had taken place, a possible scandal . I was even more shocked when he told me he had put her in the barn  . \"I wouldn't leave her out in the cold!\" he said.\nMilly had clearly been a secret lover of his. I was about to tell him he could not expect me to cover anything up when he opened the barn door. He lifted his candle and I saw a dark figure on the ground. \"She was such a good cow! I wouldn't let anyone but a doctor touch her!\" he said, and burst into tears again.",
