Many are playing online games too much. A few even visit Web sites they should not look at. A middle school teacher from Beijing warns that bad things can happen if young people spend too much time on the Internet. She had a student who used to be good at school. But then he started visiting sex Web sites. He went mad, cheated a girl and was taken away by the police.\nIn order to help young people use the Internet in a good way, a textbook on good Internet behavior has started to be used in some Shanghai middle schools this term. The book uses real examples to teach students all about good ways of using the Internet.
