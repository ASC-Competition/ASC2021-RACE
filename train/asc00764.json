  "article": "A \"talk show\" is a show organized mainly around talk. Television talk shows have been around since the dawn of radio. Thus the start of talk shows' golden age can be considered as 1948, even though television wasn't common in American homes until the 1950s. From 1949 to 1973, nearly half of all daytime programming was talk.\nWhy are there so many talk shows? A talk show costs less than $100,000 per episode  to produce whereas many of today's TV series cost more than $1 million an episode. Thus , if successful, it can produce handsome profits . Still, it takes a lot of work . Since 1948, hundreds of talk shows have come and gone, with only a few having true staying power.\nThere are several types of talk shows , but while the styles might vary, the format  is limited.\nWhat we are most used to is the informal guest-host format, in which shows'hosts welcome famous people or other talk -worthy persons for an informal discussion.\nThe second most common format is the public issues show, in which hosts interview people in the news or experts in a given field. Shows that follow this format include both morning news programs and \"issue\" talk shows:\nThe Museum of Broadcast Communications' Bernard M. Timberg notes two governing principles of all successful talk shows:\nThe host is everything :The host has a high degree of control over their show, from subject matter to comedic atmosphere . They are also the show's  brand and are responsible for it. The host can attract and refuse guests, organize their program and , in many cases, name a successor  when they retire.\nRight here, right now: The second rule is that a talk show must be experienced in the present tense, whether it is broadcast live or taped in front of an audience earlier in the day. They should feel fresh, as if they are happening in the moment, even if the show is a 10-year -old rerun.",
