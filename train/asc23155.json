  "article": "The final exam comes with June. When the exam ends  , the summer vacation begins. Boys and girls have about two months to relax. The summer vacation is the best part   of the year for most children. The weather is usually fine. They can swim, go to summer camp or visit other places with their parents.\nOf course, the beaches are good places for relaxing. Some children are lucky to live near the sea. They can enjoy the sea anytime  . But for the children far from the sea, they go to the beaches for one or two weeks with their parents.\nWhy do children like spending their summer vacations on the beaches? It is because they like the sand  , the sun, the cool wind and the sea water. There are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat, and exciting things to do.\n,.",
