  "article": "Dolphins and sharks are showing up in surprisingly shallow\nwater just off the Florida coast. Mullets, crabs, rays and small\nfish gather by the thousands off an Alabama pirer. Birds covered in\noil are crawling deep into marshes  , never to be seen again.\nMarine scientists studying the effects of the BP disaster are seeing\nsome strange phenomena. Fish and other wildlife seem to be fleeing the oil out in the Gulf and clustering in cleaner waters along the coast in a trend that some researchers see as a potentially troubling sign. The animals' presence close to shore means their usual habitat is badly polluted, and the crowding could result in mass die-offs as fish run out of oxygen. Also, the animals could easily be captured by their enemies.\nThe nearly two-month-old spill has created an environmental disaster in US history as tens of millions of gallons have flown into the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem. Scientists are seeing some unusual things as they try to understand the effects on thousands of species of marine life.\nFor nearly four hours Monday, a three-person crew with Greenpeace cruised past delicate\nislands and mangrove-dotted inlets in Barataria Bay off southern Louisiana. They saw dolphins by the dozen frolicking in the oily sheen and oil-tinged pelicans feeding their young. But they spotted no dead animals.\n\"I think part of the reason why we're not seeing more yet is that the impacts of this crisis are\nreally just beginning,\" Greenpeace marine biologist John Hocevar said.\nThe counting of dead wildlife in the Gulf is more than an academic exercise; the deaths will\nhelp determine how much BP pays in damages.",
