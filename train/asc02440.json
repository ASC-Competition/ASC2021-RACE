  "article": "Our magazine is presenting to you the top four iPhone (the best seller of Apple Company) applications for more fun on hiking or camping trips recommended by our A-list field hikers and travelers.\n1. GPS Kit by Garafa--Never get lost (for $10.)\nWhat it does: Download before you leave or use your phone's data connection to view maps from Google (satellite, landscape, cycling, and street), or Bing (shaded relief, street, or image). Record your movements, drop notes or photo makers on previously downloaded Google Earth.\n2. Photosynth by Microsoft--Perfect the view (for free!)\nWhat it does: Make 360degx360degpanoramas   to your own taste. It saves  the panorama as a single image to your camera roll after combining images. Once you get to know how to hold the iPhone and move to take the photos, you can have pretty simple, fast panoramas!\n3. Soundcloud by Soundcloud--Share the sounds (for free!)\nWhat it does: Basic sound recorder with on-board   editing (cutting) capabilities. Upload your recordings to the Internet, share on social networks and listen to and follow others! It allows for super-simple recording and uploading to the Internet. You can upload all the sounds as \"non-shared\" files, so you can download them to your computer for continued storage and editing. In addition, with _ , you will never fear your dirty laundries are to put you to shame. There is a growing community of users, including Paul Salopek who is walking around the world.\n4. Postagram by Sincerely--Send moments (application is free! /$1 per card.)\nWhat it does: The application allows personalized production of e-postcards right from your iPhone. There aren't many post offices out in the mountains, so this can be critical  to send a gift home. And even if there are post offices where you are traveling, sometimes it's easier, cheaper and more fun to send your own DIY messages home.",
