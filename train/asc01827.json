  "article": "While still in its early stages, welfare reform has already been judged a great success in many states--at least in getting people off welfare.It's estimated that more than 2 million people have left the list since 1994.\nIn the past four years, welfare list in Athens County have been cut in half.But 70 percent of the people who left in the past two years took jobs that paid less than $ 6 an hour.The result: The Athens County poverty rate still remains at more than 30 percent --twice the national average.For advocates  for the poor, that's an indication that much more needs to be done.\n\"More people are getting jobs, but it's not making their lives any better,\" says Kathy Lairn, a policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington.A center analysis of US Census data   nationwide found that between 1995 and 1996, a greater percentage of single, female-headed families were earning money on their own, but that average income for these families actually went down.\nBut for many, the fact that poor people are able to support themselves almost as well without government aid as they did with it is in itself a huge victory.\"Welfare was a poison.It was a poisonous substance that was poisoning the family,\" says Robert Rector, a welfare-reform policy analyst.\"The reform is changing the moral climate in low-income communities.It's beginning to rebuild the work ethic  , which is much more important.\"\nMr.Rector and others argued that once \"the habit of dependency is cracked,\" then the country can make other policy changes aimed at improving living standards.",
