  "article": "The first ting we do is to put an APB and this goes to all the police stations in the country.\nNext we telephone the hospitals. Often the person we are looking for has been in an accident.\nThen we might try parents, friends or relatives they might be with. We try to follow their movements and to find the last person they saw in local or national papers--especially papers they might read. There are other things we can do: put posters in places where they might be, go on television.\nHere in America there is a magazine in which there are photographs of missing children. This is often the last hope. Of course, with nearly two million missing children every year, we can't do all these things for everyone. We haven't got the time, or the money , or the people who work for it.",
