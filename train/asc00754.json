  "article": "Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that he planned to give away almost all of his vast fortune , largely to the cause of global health , during the course of his lifetime . With an estimated worth of more than $ 40 billion , according to Forbes , the project will be no small feat  for Gates . Having already provided the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with $ 24 billion to address global health issues , Gates said that eventually his entire fortune will be put towards the cause except \"a few percent left for the kids.\"\nSo what has made the richest man in the world to channel his resources so heavily into one interest ? Gates believes that \"the equality of opportunity\" in which Americans take such pride needs to extend to other nations around the world . Improving the health of the populations , he says , has proven to be an essential method in helping poor countries to be financially successful . \"National borders allow inequalities ,\" said Gates : \"We all need to take a more global view , rather than just saying my country is doing well . We have to step up these health issues , knowing how few resources are going into them .\"\nGates said that both his parents set an example for him as a child . His father , William H. Gates , was the head of the local Planned Parenthood , and his mother , Mary , volunteered for the United Way . As he gathered his fortune , Gates knew he would eventually want to give back as well , but he didn't expect to devote himself whole-heartedly to one project until he was about 60.\nHowever , Gates , 47 , began to question his ability to wait that long . \"It seemed there was a real time urgency,\" Gates said . \"I started to think , How many lives could I save before then ?\"",
