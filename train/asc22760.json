  "article": "Many people think the camel stores only water in its hump ,but it does not,Instead,the camel stores something else there----food.The camel's hump is really a hump of fat.When the camel,often called\"a ship of the desert\",is not travelling and is in a place where there is plenty of food and water,it eats and drinks a lot. As it does so, its hump rises from the fat its body makes. Then when the camel is travelling through the desert and when there is little food,it can live off the stored fat.\nA camel can go on for days or weeks with little feed or water.However its hunger reaches the point starvation ,its hump shrinks  and may even slip off its back and hang down its side.\nCamels are not fussy  about what they eat.Thorny  plants don't hurt their mouths,grasses of any kinds will do and so will hay,dry grain,cactuses.(,,)\nThere are one--humpcamels and two--hump camels. Camels with one hump are calledArabian camels,mainly coming from North Africa. Camels with two humps are mainly from Asia.",
