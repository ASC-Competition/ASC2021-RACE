  "article": "Nicky Haywood, from Nottingham, was found guilty   of travelling on an East Midlands train from Nottingham to Newstead without a ticket.\nThe 27-year-old, who did not appear for his hearing at Nottingham Magistrates  Court  , is now being made to pay the price --- which is almost 200 times the original  price ---- for the 20 minute journey.\nAccording to the Nottingham Post, Magistrates have ordered Haywood to pay a $ 220 fine, $ 302 in costs, a $ 22 government surcharge   and the $ 2.80 fare.\nSenior conductor, Yvonne Clay was working on the day of the incident, according to the Nottingham Post.\nThe newspaper reported that she said Haywood had got on the train without a ticket, though he had the chance to buy one from both vending machines and booking offices on the platform.\nShe said:\"He offered a Solo Electron card but we could not take that on the train. I informed him with a notice to pay. He gave his name and address and had 21 days to pay the fare.\"\nEven though he was given three weeks to pay the $ 2.80, a payment from Haywood was not received.",
