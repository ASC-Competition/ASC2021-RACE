It is also the world's largest sea cave in existence today and a perfect place to get up close and personal with nature. The sea caves are said to be the home of an estimated 200 sea lions and that at any given time visitors can expect to see at least 150 sea lions going about their daily business.\nThe most immense  of all sea lions, the Stellar males are known to grow up to 12 feet in length and weight an incredulous 1,500 pounds. The females, on the other hand, tend to be a bit smaller and average 9 feet in length with an average weight of 700 pounds.\nThey tend to breed and give birth during the spring and summer months. The breeding and birthing process takes place on the steep cliff ledges that surround the sea cave. Therefore the best time to view this ritual is during those select months from the outside viewing platform.\nIn addition to the sea lions, visitors can expect to catch a glimpse of the rare Pigeon Guillemont. These unusual sea birds tend to nest in seaweed along the cliff ledges in early April. And ever the graceful Gray Whales are expected to be seen. Each year, travelling in pods, these sea creatures _ around \" Cape Blance\" on their way to and from their native Alaska waters.\nAs of 2010 \" Sea Lion Caves\" is open daily year round except for both Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. The ticket box office is open from 9:00 am until 5:30 pm. Visitor have a choice of two different ticket options; platform view or cave view. And admission into the cave itself is $13.00 for adults and $ 8.00 for children ages 3 to 12. Children under the age of 2 are admitted for free and there is a discount ticket price available for senior citizens . It currently costs $3.50 per person to access the topside wildlife viewing platform. While on the platform visitor can pay an additional fee to use the on-site telescope or opt   to bring their own such equipment.",
