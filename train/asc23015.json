  "article": "When I was young, my father used to grow carnations -- a kind of flower that was red, pink or white. He took care of them with much love and devotion. Every day he came home from work, he would enjoy watching them. And he used to tell us, \"No one should touch my flowers.\"\nOne day, my younger sister Clemence, who loved dad very much, wanted to help him. So she cut the carnation from their stems   one by one and arranged   them on the ground. She believed that dad would be very happy to see them that way.\nWhen mom and I realized what my sister had done, we became completely silent. However, my sister didn't know why no one showed her any appreciation  . When dad arrived, he went as usual straight to watch the flowers. Seeing his flowers lying on the ground like dead animals, he was shocked at first. He looked towards the street to see if it was any of the neighbors' children who could have done it. Then he looked at mom in silence. Finally mom, who always taught us to tell the truth no matter what, said, \"No bad neighbors did this great job, only your lovely daughter Clemence.\"\nDad's face changed into a smile and then he said, \"Do I have better flower than my lovely daughter?\" My younger sister smiled and hugged   dad strongly.\n,.",
