  "article": "A 15-year-old boy was injured in a car accident when the car he was traveling in was hit by a truck at a street corner. The boy was taken to a nearby hospital. The doctors said it appeared that the boy had nothing more serious than a broken left leg, but there was a possibility that the boy might have some inside injuries. The boy was conscious  when he was sent to the hospital. Luckily, his mother, who was driving, was uninjured. She said that the truck appeared so suddenly that she thought she was going to die. She turned her car sharply to the left, and the truck hit it on the passenger side. [:]\nThe driver of the truck was a 50-year-old man who was unemployed and it was clear that he had been drinking because the police found 18 empty beer cans inside his truck. However, the man _ drinking even if he had failed the police test for drinking, saying, \"No, I haven't drunk anything.\" When asked to touch his nose , ears, and mouth with his eyes closed, he was unable to touch any part of his head.\nSo the police put him into the back seat of a police car. But the man kept crying, \"Mabel, where is my Mabel? I can't find her now. I want my Mabel.\" The police asked him if Mabel was his wife. He said, \"She's my dog, my dog! Where's my baby?\" Later in the day, the police found a dog with a ring around her neck, on which was written \"Mabel\" half a block away from where the accident happened. Perhaps the man was looking for his pet dog after drinking when the accident happened. As a result, the man was taken to the city jail for driving after drinking and it seemed that Mabel would be left alone.",
