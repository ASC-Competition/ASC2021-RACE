  "article": "The animal kingdom has a new member. On September 12, 2012, researchers made a report to the world that they discovered a new species  of monkey. It is called the lesula. And it is only the second monkey species discovered in 28 years.\nScientists first saw the lesula in June, 2007 in Congo, a country in Africa. The lesula lives in the rain forests. The monkey was first found as a pet in a local family. When researchers found it, the family told them that they caught the monkey in the wild and then kept it as a pet.\nThe scientists have compared the lesula to the owl-faced monkey. The owl-faced monkey gets its name for having a long nose and a face that looks like an owl . The lesula and the owl-faced monkey are similar in size and both have a stripe  on their nose. This shows the lesula and the owl-faced monkeys are close relatives, but different species. Scientists say the lesula usually weighs about twelve pounds. It has long blond hair. It eats like a vegetarian .\nScientists say it is important to protect African rain forests because there may be other new species like lesula to be discovered in the future.",
