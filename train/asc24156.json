  "article": "Dear Mr Han,\nI just turned 12 years old, but I am very thin and not as tall as my classmates. My brother is 20 and is very tall. My father is also very tall. I eat lots of vegetables every day. I like eating fruit, but I don't like eating meat. I sleep for eight hours a day. I want to be tall. I am taking medicine. I think that medicine can make me grow   tall. My head teacher tells me that you are a great Chinese doctor. Can I grow tall? Do I need to take the medicine?\nYours,\nJack\nDear Jack,\nI think that you can grow tall, because your father and brother are both very tall. You are still growing. As for the medicine, you should stop taking it. It is not good for your health. You should eat more meat. I am happy that you like eating vegetables and fruit. A balanced diet is very important for your health --and it can make you grow tall.\nYours,\nMr Han\n,.",
