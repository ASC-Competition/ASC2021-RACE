  "article": "Superfast doubledecker   trains will be taking passengers from London to six big cities in the UK by 2033. The first phase   linking London to the West Midlands with a connection to HS1 is expected to open in 2026, and the second  phase to Manchester and Leeds in 2032.\nThe government set out a plan for the highspeed rail network in 2012. When the project is finished, it will take less time to get to London from major cities like Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Traveling at a speed of up to 250 mph, passengers will be able to come and go from Birmingham to London in 49 minutes, reducing the journey time by almost half from one hour and 24 minutes.\nA journey from Birmingham to Leeds will be reduced from two hours to 57 minutes and a journey from Manchester to London will be reduced from two hours and 8 minutes to one hour and 8 minutes.\n\"HS2  is an  important  part of transport's  lowcarbon future,\" Transport  Secretary Justine Greening said. Some people aren't happy about the plan, though. HS2 will cost around PS33 billion. It will also be built near some towns and villages, disturbing the people that live there.\nBut the Chancellor of the Exchequer   George Osborne thinks it will help build the future for Britain. \"It's a longterm decision,\" he said.\nHS2 is designed for everything around the needs of the passengers. It will provide a new and exciting travel experience. There will be plenty of room, intelligent ticketing, a good service and high quality comfort and access to trains. This is a transport network for the new century and beyond.",
