Ying Miaofang paid 1,800yuan per month to rent a small house near Changning Road in Shanghai, and spent more money on a new air conditioner, a refrigerator, a TV set and other things. She published her phone number in the newspaper and opened the house for Expo visitors for free on June 23.\nBesides providing a free living place., Ying got up very early every morning to buy food, cook breakfast, clean rooms and wash clothes for those guests.
