  "article": "There are a lot of products out there that make your life easier. Some, however, are a little sillier than others -- so much that they seem like joke products. Here are a few products that sound crazy, but actually rule.\nSleep Phones\nIt's hard to imagine something sillier than a music-playing headband you wear while you sleep, but they exist -- and are quite popular. Sleep Phones won't give you the highest quality sound in the world, but if you prefer to fall asleep to music, they're far more comfortable than normal headphones. While they're a bit expensive, they might be perfect for you. There's also a wireless version   if you prefer.\nOnion Goggles\nIf cutting onion _ no matter what you try, it's time for desperate measures. We tested a bunch of methods for avoiding onion tears, and found the best solutions came down to cutting the onion under a vent  , or wearing these stylish and awesome goggles.\nLock Laces\nThere're some great ways to tie your shoes better, but if you long for the laceless shoes of your childhood days, Lock Laces are a pretty good choice. They're basically elastic   laces that remove the need to tie your shoes. Sure, people will make fun of you, but you can make fun of them after they trip over their own untied laces. Or you can make your own slip-on shoes with elastic tubing.\n2D-Glasses\nHate 3D-movies, but have to go to one? The difference between 2D-glasses and 3D-glasses lies in their lenses  . Each lens of 2D-glasses blocks the same picture, so each eye gets the same picture, while each lens of 3D-glasses blocks a different picture, so each eye gets a different picture which the brain interprets as 3D. Now you have a pair of glasses that can save you from the headache caused by wearing 3D-glasses which are popular in our movie theaters. You can buy them or make a pair for yourself.",
