  "article": "School violence is in the headlines again after recent shootings at schools in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Colorado. After hearing the news, it's natural for students -- no matter how old they are or where they go to school -- to worry about whether this type of incident may someday happen to them.\nSo how safe are schools? It's actually safer to be in a school than in a car. Twice as many 15-to-19-year-olds die in car accidents than in shootings (and that's all shootings, not just the ones that happen in schools). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 1% of all homicides   among school-age children happen on school grounds or on the way to and from school. So the vast majority of students will never experience violence at school.\nHowever, some schools have re-evaluated their safety needs in response to the concerns of families and communities. Some now require that guests check in at the office or have more guards on duty. Some schools have fixed metal detectors. Another thing that helps make schools safer is greater awareness of problems like bullying and discrimination. Many schools have practiced programs to fight these problems and to help teachers and administrators know more about protecting students from this type of violence.\nThe cause of school violence isn't easy to understand. There is no single reason why students become violent. Some are just copying behavior they've seen at home, in the streets, or in video games, movies, or television. There's one thing experts do agree on, though: Having access to guns or other weapons makes it easier for some people to lash out against the things or people they don't like.",
