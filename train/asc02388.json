  "article": "Imagine this: you get up in the morning and put on a custom printed T-shirt. Then you eat some 3-D printed food and relax on your printed sofa. Perhaps you take a ride in a printed electric car to the hospital to get a printed tooth fitted.\nThough some of these things may seem impossible, they're closer to reality than you might think. The world of 3-D printing is coming to a store near you soon.\nThe idea of 3-D printing is to produce complicated shapes in a very personalized way. If you want to make a totally new object, you need to make a virtual design in a CAD(computer aided design)file first. Or you can use a 3-D scanner to make a digital copy of an object. Then, based on the design or copy, the 3-D printer makes paper-thin slices out of liquid, plastic, or metal and puts them together to create the object you want.\nThere are many areas in which 3-D printing can change our lives. One such area is health care. Researchers have developed simple 3-D printed organs, which can be used in life-saving operations. A 17-year-old boy in the US has also recently developed a brain-powered, 3-D printed replacement hand. From heart monitors to fake limbs , we can soon be living longer thanks to 3-D printed technology.\nAnother area that 3-D technology looks sure to change is food. Can you imagine being able to print your favorite dishes at home at the touch of a button? Even big companies are behind the trend. Hersheys, one of the largest chocolate makers in the world, recently announced that it would start producing chocolate with the help of 3-D printers. NASA, the US space agency, has reportedly spent $125,000 (767,594 yuan) developing a \"3-D pizza printer\".\nIt is not yet clear how long it will take until 3-D printers are available to everyone. But one thing is for sure: the possibilities are endless.",
