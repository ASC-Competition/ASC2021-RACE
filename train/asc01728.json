  "article": "There is no doubt that much of the profit of a business--sometimes the whole of its success--depends upon the use of the odds and ends.The odds and ends are various small things,which are left over when the main things are produced.But they possess a real value of their own.\nIf a business,big or small,looked down upon these odds and ends,it would mean a big difference in the amount of the benefit of the business.Take a meat factory for instance, there are countless odds and ends--bones and hair,which can be made into glue and rope to increase its profit greatly.\nThen,if we are college students,what about our odds and ends--the odd moments? Take time for example.Every one of us has the exact same amount of it.Everyone's success or failure depends on the use of their time.But everyone uses the time more or less in the same way.However,why many great men in science or art have made huge successes for themselves in the world?Because they have made best use of their odd moments.Take Thomas A.Edison, he never allowed his odd moments to slip by.He thought,planned,and tried his inventions.He always worked twenty hours out of each twenty-four.His inventions made him famous all over the world,and provided valuable wealth for the human beings.\nSo, remember this axiom:very busy people always find time for everything.However,people with great spare time find time for nothing.Is it very strange?Not at all!The question is how to gather up fragments of time and make full use of them.As many big businesses have found,that the real profit is in using the odds and ends.We also must do in this way to make best use of our odd moments and manage to be successful in something that we do.",
