  "article": "The Truth Can Set You Free\nI recently got pulled over for speeding not far from my new home in Virginia. I hadn't been paying attention, and I had driven a few miles an hour over the speed limit.\n\"Can I see your license and registration?\" the police officer asked me. I pulled both out for him, and he saw my Pittsburgh address on my Pennsylvania driver's license.\n\"What are you doing here?\" he asked. \"Are you with the army?\"\n\"No, I'm not.\" I answered. I explained that I had just moved to Virginia, and I hadn't had time to re-register yet.\n\"So what brings you here?\"\nHe had asked a direct question. Without thinking very hard, I gave him a direct answer. \"Well, officer,\" I said, \"since you've asked, I have cancer. I have just months to live. We've moved down here to be close to my wife's family.\"\n\"So you've got cancer,\" he said flatly. He was trying to figure me out. Was I really dying? Was I lying? He took a long look at me. \"You know, for a guy who has only a few months to live, you sure look good.\"\nHe was obviously thinking: \"Either this guy is pulling one big fat line on me, or he's telling the truth.\" He was trying to question my honesty without directly calling me a liar. And so he had forced me to prove that I was being honest.\n\"Well, officer, I know that I look pretty healthy. I look great on the outside, but the tumors are on the inside.\" And then, I don't know what possessed me, but I just did it. I pulled up my shirt, showing the operational scars.\nHe looked at my scars. He looked in my eyes. He now knew he was talking to a dying man. Well, he wasn't taking this any further. He handed me back my license. \"Do me a favor.\" he said, \"Slow down from now on.\"\nThe awful truth had set me free. As he went back to his police car, I had a realization. I had been one of those gorgeous blondes   who could bat her eyelashes and get out of tickets. I drove home under the speed limit, and I was smiling like a beauty queen.",
