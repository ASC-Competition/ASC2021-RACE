  "article": "If you are a human, you can't help but experience the time when everything seems to be going wrong and you feel as if your life is completely out of control.It is during the low time that words of encouragement from family, friends, coworkers or even strangers can boost your spirits.It is also during the low time that destructive words can be devastating and make you sink deeper and deeper into depression.\nFor example, consider this story about a group of frogs who were traveling through the woods when two of them fell into a deep pit .All of the other frogs gathered around the pit.When they saw how deep the pit was, they told the two unfortunate frogs they would never get out.\nThe two frogs ignored the comments and tried to jump out of the pit.The other frogs kept telling them to stop.Finally, one of the two frogs took notice of what the other frogs were saying and simply gave up.He died.The other frog continued to jump as hard as he could.Once again the crowd of frogs shouted at him to stop the pain.The more they shouted, the harder he jumped and finally he made it.\nWhen he got out, the other frogs asked him why he continued to jump when they were all shouting at him to tell him to give up.The frog explained to them that he was a little bit deaf.He thought they were encouraging him the whole time.\nEvery time you have a chance to say either something positive or negative to another human being, do choose the chance to say something positive! Don't let those opportunities get away from you.Your words have a large amount of power.Use them wisely.You really never know just how much they can mean to someone else.",
