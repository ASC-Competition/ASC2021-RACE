The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed. Glancing  at her scornfully , he told her the dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant the next day.\nShe returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other. After searching out the rude assistant she asked for the same dress. Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time. With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress. As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did not like it.
