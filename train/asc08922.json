  "article": "Some people may be born happy, while others are genetically negative, scientists have suggested in a study published late February in a British journal.\nEarlier research had already established that the gene known as 5-HTTLPR plays a key role in determining how the neurotransmitter   serotonin works within the brain. Serotonin, a hormone  , passes chemical messages between nerve cells. It has been closely linked to mood. Several anti-depressant   drugs regulate serotonin levels.\n   Scientists had also identified three variants   of the gene. Two so-called \"short\" variants were linked to a higher risk of depression and suicide attempts. Unlike the two \"short\" variants, the \"long\" variant of 5-HTTLPR showed a clear dislike of negative images, such as fierce animals, and a clear liking for positive ones, such as flowers.\n   Researchers from the University of Essex in Britain showed participants a series of images, which were divided into three kinds: negative ones aimed at inspiring fear or stress such as a snake or person about to commit suicide, pleasant ones and neutral   ones. \n   The participants who had the long variant of the 5-HTTLPR gene \"showed a clear dislike of negative material alongside a careful attention for positive material,\" the researchers found. They paid close attention to the pretty pictures, and ignored the frightening ones. On the other hand, the short variant groups had the opposite reaction.\n   In January, the Australian government organized \"happiness workshops\", teaching government staff how to be happy. The department that held the \"happiness workshops\" said unhappy staff weren't productive staff. \n   Australian political opposition parties have argued that the \"happiness workshops\" are probably a waste of money and couldn't increase productivity as intended. However, whether the workshop will have a happy or disappointing result, we will have to wait and see.",
