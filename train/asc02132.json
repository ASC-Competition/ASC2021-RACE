  "article": "As the United States nears the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that killed more than 3,000 people, President Obama announced Sunday night that the al Qaeda  leader and mastermind of that horrific day, Osama bin Laden, has been killed.\nCNN reports that a senior government official confirmed that bin Laden was shot by a small team of U.S. soldiers while in a mansion with family members outside Islamabad . His body is now in American custody  and is being handled according to Islamic customs. Three other adult men were killed in the firefight, including a son of bin Laden's, who was a senior member of the terrorist organization.\n\"Justice has been done,\" the president announced, saying that the operation he ordered after receiving intelligence information is \"the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaeda.\"\nThe immediate reactions ranged from cautious to ecstatic. Crowds cheered outside the White House. But officials said a \"worldwide caution\" would be set for Americans in case of al Qaeda retaliation .\nWill bin Laden's death be the justice Americans have sought for nearly a decade?\nGordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93, said it does bring comfort.\n\"This is important news for us, and for the world. It cannot ease our pain, or bring back our loved ones. It does bring a measure of comfort that the mastermind of the September 11th tragedy and the face of global terror can no longer spread his evil,\" Felt said.\nPresident Obama says this victory does not close the book.\n\"His death does not mark the end of our effort. There's no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must and we will remain cautious,\" he noted.",
