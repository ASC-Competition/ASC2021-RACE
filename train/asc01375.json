  "article": "Getting away for a short time always seems like a great idea--until you have to pack. The rule is: pack light. Here are some tips to help you pack.\nOrganize Yourself\nMake a list. Think of what you need from your head to your toes. When you've done this once, it'll be easier next time.\nStart Small\nConsider buying small-size samples of shampoo, toothpaste, and other items at your local store. Make sure they are all sealed tightly.\nIn an emergency, you can purchase them at your destination. But remember that the time you spend buying things at your destination will reduce your visiting time.\nThe Clothing Dilemma\nChoosing which clothes to bring is probably the hardest packing decision to make. Think once again from head to toe -- hat, shirts, jeans, sneakers, etc. Once you've picked out what you want to bring, think carefully. Do you really need that extra pair of jeans? If so, fine. Don't try to fool yourself. You are the one who will be left holding the bag.\nWeather is an important factor in your packing. If it's cold, you could wear a jacket, a sweater, a regular shirt, and a T-shirt. Layering up will keep you warm and it will leave more room in your bag. Roll up your casual clothes instead of folding and laying them flat. This leaves more room to pack other things, and keeps your clothes fairly wrinkle-free.\nRemember how much easier it will be to carry your bag!",
