  "article": "Leopards   live in many parts of the world, from Siberia to Africa. They have a very beautiful yellow skin with large black spots. They live for about 15 years and eat small mammals   such as zebras, monkeys, and antelopes   .They sleep for about 12 hours a day . Leopards are very solitary animals. They spend most of their time alone in trees, where they wait until a small animal passes. They jump on the animal and then drag it up into the tree, where they eat it.\nLike many animals, leopards are disappearing because people hunt them. They kill them for their beautiful coats. The Sinai leopard, for example, from Egypt, is now probably extinct .",
