  "article": "Last summer, as part of my high school graduation project, I volunteered at Saunders House nursing home. I choose this experience because it was something that I had never done before and I wanted to lend a helping hand. At first it was challenging because I was extremely shy. My goal in volunteering was to bring a smile to the residents   by doing different activities from word games to playing chess. I feel as if I had finished that goal.\nAt the nursing home, I did a lot of different activities with the residents ranging from Jeopardy to Wheel of Fortune. One of my favorites was a word game where I would write a ten -letter word on the board and the residents would try to come up with as many smaller words as possible. I could tell that it was one of their favorite games because they always seemed to be so enthusiastic   when they played. I also transported residents to and from their rooms when they needed help; and whenever it was a nice day out, I would take them outside to get some fresh air and relax. On Saturday mornings, I would deliver the newspaper to the residents and on Sundays, I helped with morning church services.\nThe most unforgettable part of this experience was when I had one-on-one conversations with the residents. It was incredible   how many great stories they had to tell. Their stories were so interesting and the experience was unforgettable for me.",
