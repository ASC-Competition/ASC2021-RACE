  "article": "If you are a fruit grower--or would like to become one--take advantage of Apple Day to see what's around.\nIt's called Apple Day but in practice it's more like Apple Month. The day itself is on October 21, but sinceit has\ncaught on, events now spread out over most of October around Britain.\nVisiting an apple event is a good chance to see, and often taste, a wide variety of apples. To people who are used to the limited choice of apples such as Golden Delicious and Royal Gala in supermarkets, it can be quite an eye opener to see the range of classical apples still in existence, such as Decio which was grown by the Romans. Although it doesn't taste of anything special, it's still worth a try, as is the knobbly  Cat's Head which is more of a curiosity than anything else.\nThere are also varieties developed to suit specific local conditions. One of the very best varieties for eating quality is Orleans Reinette, but you'll need a warm, sheltered place with perfect soil to grow it, so it's _ for most apple lovers who fall for it.\nAt the events, you can meet expert growers and discuss which ones will best suit your conditions, and because these are family affairs, children are well catered for with apple-themed fun and games.\nApple Days are being held at all sorts of places with an interest in fruit, including stately gardens and commercial orchards .If you want to have a real orchard experience, try visiting the National Fruit Collection at Brogdale, near Faversham in Kent.",
