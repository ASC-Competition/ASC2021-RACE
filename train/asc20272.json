  "article": "In most parts of the world there are four seasons. They are spring, summer, fall and winter. In different seasons people wear different clothes and do different things. For example, in summer the weather is hot, so people usually wear cool clothes and do things like swimming, boating or surfing . But near the polar regions , there are only two seasons: winter and summer. In winter, nights are long. For more than two months  you can't see the sun. In summer, days are long and the sun is always in the sky. There are no nights. The people living near the North Pole  are called Inuit . In summer they live in tents and catch deer for food. In winter they live in small round snow houses. They can build  a snow house. They make holes  in the ice and catch fish and seals . They eat much meat but not many vegetables.",
