I thought things would be fine.\nIt's very hard for me to be happy and sometimes I get lost in thought. So I can't follow the teacher. I know it is not right like this, but I can't control myself in class. Then my study is bad now. Some students make fun of me. I feel hurt , but I don't show my anger. In fact, I have to hide  my unhappiness. I feel terrible.\nDear Mary, I really don't know what to do now, Can you help me?\nYours,\nJane\n,A, B, C, D,, .",
