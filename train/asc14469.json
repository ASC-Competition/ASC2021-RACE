He felt terrible. \"I must be sick,\" he thought. \"but I must study for that test.\"\nHe got up and looked for his history notebook. He finally found it under a pile of clothes on a chair. He went over his history notes, but he couldn't remember any of the facts in the notes. \"What shall I do?\" he thought. He felt terrible.\nJust then Paul's telephone rang. He put down his notebook and picked up the telephone.\n\"Good morning,\" Jack's voice said, \"You must be wrong about that test.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" Paul asked weakly.\n\"We're not going to have the test today.\" Jack said. \"I wrote down the date in my notebook. The test will be next Wednesday; it isn't today. How do you feel this morning?\"\n\"Fine,\" said Paul. \"Just fine!\" Suddenly he really felt fine.",
