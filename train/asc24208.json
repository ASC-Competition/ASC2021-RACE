One of the most popular programme _ is the talent show, partly because people of all ages are interested in it.\nEarly shows, like Opportunity Knocks (1965-1978), required people to vote  for their favorite acts and performers, although in those days voting was done by postcard instead of by telephone, text, or over the Internet. Today, the success of television talent shows has reached a new level. Here are Ihe UK's top three TV talent shows:\nThe X Factor In this wonderful singing competition, performers have to face a celebrity judge panel  before the public vote. Many excellent singers became popular because of it. The show is now made all over the world, from China to Colombia.\nStrictly Come Dancing--The programme is so fantastic that it attracts many celebrities. They team up with professional  dancers and come to the dance floor to win the title of Strictly Come Dancing Champion.\nBritain's Got Talent -- In this modern-day version  of Opportunity Knocks, the public can go and choose from many kinds of acts, from dancing dogs to ice skating.
