  "article": "On behalf of the Obama family,I want to wish you a very happy Thanksgiving.\nLike many of you. we'll spend the day with family and friends,catching up,eating some good food and watching a little football.Before we lift a fork,we lend a hand by going out in the community to serve some of our neighbors in need.And we give thanks for each other, and for all of God's blessings.We all share this day,united by the gratitude for the bounty  of this nation.\nAnd we welcome the contributions of all people-no matter their origin or color or beliefs-who call America home, and who enrich the life of our nation.  It is a belief as old as our founding:\"Epluribus unum\" -- _ . We are reminded that this creed, and America itself was never an inevitability, but the result of ordinary people in every generation doing their part to uphold our founding ideals-by taking the blessings of freedom, and multiplying them for those who would follow.\nAs President Kennedy once wrote, even as we give thanks for all that we've inherited from those who came before us-\"the decency(,) of purpose, steadfastness of resolve and strength of will, for the courage and the humility, which they possessed.\" we must also remember that \"the highest appreciation is not to utter words but to live by them.\"\nToday,we are grateful to all Americans who do their part to live by those ideals, including our brave men and women in uniform overseas and their families, who sacrifice so much to keep America safe.We are grateful to the countless Americans who serve their communities in soup kitchens and shelters,looking out for those who are less fortunate,and lifting up those who have fallen on hard times.\nThis generosity, this compassion, this belief that we are each other's keepers, is essential to who we are, not just on this day,but every day.It's easy to focus on what separates us.But as we gather with loved ones on this Thanksgiving, let's remember and be grateful for what ties us together.\nOur love of country.Our commitment to justice and equality.Our belief that America's best days are ahead,and that her destiny is ours to shape-and that our inherited ideals must be the birthright of all of our children.\nThat's what today is all about: _ Thank you, God bless you.",
