  "article": "My grandfather worked as a carpenter. On this particular day, he was building some crates for the clothes his church was sending to an orphanage in Brazil. On his way home, he found his glasses were gone. When he mentally replayed his earlier actions, he realized what happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket and fallen into one of the crates. His new glasses were heading for Brazil!\nThe Great Depression was at its height, and Grandpa had six children. He had spent twenty dollars for those glasses that very morning.\n\"It's not fair,\" he thought as he walked home angrily. \"I've been very faithful in giving my time and money to my work, and now this.\"\nSeveral months later, the director of the orphanage came to the United States. He wanted to visit all the churches that supported him, so he came to my grandfather's small church in Chicago.\nHe began by thanking the people for their kindness in supporting the orphanage. \"But most of all,\" he said, \" I must thank you for the glasses you sent last year. You see, some people had just come to the orphanage, destroying everything, including my glasses. I was desperate. Even if I had the money, there was simply no way of replacing those glasses. Along with not being able to see well, I experienced headaches every day, so my coworkers and I were very worried about this. Then your crates arrived. When I removed the covers, I found a pair of glasses lying on top.\"\nHe paused long enough to let his words sink in. Then, he continued: \"When I tried on the glasses, it was as though they had been made just for me!\" The people listened, happy for the miraculous glasses. But they thought it was strange because there were no glasses on their list of items to be sent overseas.\nSitting quietly in the back, with tears streaming down his face, my grandfather, an ordinary carpenter realized his glasses had found a good place to go.",
