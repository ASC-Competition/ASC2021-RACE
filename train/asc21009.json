  "article": "Monkeys are clever and lively, but they are naughty and greedy   as well. Whenver they find delicious food, they will eat enough.  What's more, they will take it when they leave. They have suffered   a lot because of this. But they never change this way.\nIn India, people use monkey's greed to catch them. Do you know how they can catch monkeys? Here are some instructions.\n*              Make a hole in a big pumpkin  . The hole must be just right     ----neither too big nor too small.\n*              Put some jujubes   in the hole.\n*              Leave the pumpkin under a tree. Make sure there are some monkeys in   the tree.\n*              Hide yourself and watch the monkeys.\nAs soon you leave, the monkeys can't wait to come down to the pumpkin. When they find a hole in the pumpkin, they don't know what's in it and one of them can't help putting its hand into the hole to find what on earth there is. When it touches the jujubes, it will clench   some of them in its hand. As a result, it isn't able to take its fist   out of the hole. You can't come close until this time. Will the monkey drop off the pumpkin? Don't worry. It prefers the pumpkin than its life. It will run with the pumpkin, clenching its fist more tightly. In the end, it is caught helplessly.",
