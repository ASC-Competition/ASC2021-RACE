  "article": "Some people are pessimistic when they think about the future. They say that, a hundred years from now, we will have used up most of the earths resources. We will have made our seas so dirty that we will not be able to eat fish from them. There will be so many people in the world that we will have to use all the countryside for housing; there will be no farmland left.\nOther people have a different idea about the future. In their view, the city of the future will be a huge pyramid-shaped  building, which will be floating on the surface of the sea. About 5,000 families will live there, and there will also be schools, shops in it.\nIn a hundred years' time, people will not need to use oil. They will heat their homes with power from the sun.\nThink of space. Perhaps a station will be set up on the moon; people will be able to visit the moon as tourists. They may even spend their holidays in space, travelling from planet to planet.\nWhat an interesting picture!\nMany people don't think about the future. \"I don't care. I'll be dead. \"they say. But it is our duty to care because the world of a hundred years' time will be the world of our children's and their children after them.",
