  "article": "Tibet is in the southwest of China. It is the home to many natural wonders, such as valleys, mountains, lakes and even deserts. Tibet is very large, so it is perfect for traveling, especially the bike tour .\nYou can start the wonderful bike tour in Tibet's capital, Lhasa. It is 3600 metres above the sea level. It's very high, isn't it? So it is important to spend a few days there to get used to  the thin air there, or you may feel sick and get hurt. The bike tour will pass rivers, large open grassland and high mountains, including the world's famous Mount Everest .\nAfter finishing the bike tour, people will feel quite successful. They will also have hundreds of photos of the wonderful places.",
