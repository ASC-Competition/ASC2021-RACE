  "article": "I had recently arrived in London and I wanted to see some of the famous places. Should I go to the seaside? Or maybe one of the famous parks? I walked along the street, past a kindergarten playground, and suddenly saw an underground railway station. I was surprised because it was not on my map. I went to buy a ticket. The ticket-seller looked very old. He gave me a ticket, said \"Remember it's a return\", laughed and walked away without taking my money. Was it special for tourists?\nA train arrived. I could not see any other passengers. I got on and the doors closed. I suddenly felt I should not have got onto the train. It started to go faster and faster, shooting along the tracks. As it entered the tunnel, everything became as dark as midnight and I do not remember the next few minutes. The train came to a station and I got out. I could see light shining in the distance so I walked towards _ and came to a door. Beyond it there was a busy street.\nThere were lots of English people walking about, and I could see some of the famous buildings of London, but there was something wrong. The people's clothes were strange. There were no cars, no motorbikes--but there were horses everywhere. Was someone making a film?\n\"Excuse me,\" I said to a man. \"Would you mind telling me where I am and what is happening?\"\n\"What do you mean? Who are you? Where do you come from? Are you from China? This is London and everyone's going to work. Can't you see that?\" he asked.\n\"Thank you, sir. I'm sorry, but could I look at your newspaper?\" I asked.\n\"You can have it,\" he said as he walked off.\nI looked at it; I saw \"New Bicycle Law\" and above that \"July 5, 1880\".\nMaybe I should have walked around, but I ran back to the door. I waited a long time. I was very afraid. A train came. I got on. It took me back to the first station. As I left, a woman asked, \"What were you doing in that abandoned station?\" I had no answer, but I still had the newspaper in my hand.",
