  "article": "Hurry! Time to \"steal vegetables\"\nDon't be afraid! We are not encouraging the stealing behavior, but to tell you maybe the most popular topic from white-collars' mouth in cities. Together with \"How many vegetables do you steal today,\" \"it's harvest time for your ripe peach,\" \"I bought you a new car today.\"\nAre there so many people in the city really have their own farms, or are they really so rich to buy someone else cars casually?\nThe answer is obviously negative. They just play some games on Social Network Sites (SNS) like kaixin001.com.\nCan you imagine that more than millions of people in Chinese mainland will spend lots of time on SNS to play game and talk to friends, especially white-collars who work in the cities? Take kaixin001.com as an example, the current member of it has already hit 38 million.\nHowever, the great number of people who would like to use such SNS indicates another social problem. That is lots of people choose to escape from the reality. And SNS just offer them a Virtual space to forget the reality.\nKinds of games and various of friends do give netizens lots of fun. Though indulging, dreaming, chatting and playing , it seems like people could really escape from all the upsets in reality. But virtual world is not real and no one can live in it forever, and reality is not that simple like noodling around on the internet.\nSince this kind of social phenomenon is so popular on the internet, people start thinking to remove it in the reality.After playing the \"happy farm\" game on kaixin001.com, would you like to put yourself among the real corps while smelling the fragrance of the countryside? Recently, a farm land service called \"happy farm in reality\" was opened in the suburbs of Shanghai where white-collar workers from around that region can experience the real farmer's life by themselves",
