  "article": "Nowadays we can see ATMs everywhere. So we'd better learn how to use an ATM to withdraw money.\nFirst, we must find an ATM for your cards. Some ATMs can only work with certain bank's cards. But now more and more ATMs can use all the banks' cards.\nSecond, we can put our cards in a slot on the right side of the machine. Make sure the card is facing the right way.\nThen , when the screen says, \"Please enter your PIN,\" we can press the numbers. After that, we can select the type of transaction .So we can press the key for withdrawing money.\nNext, we can put in the amount of money we want to withdraw by pressing the numbers. Then the screen may say, \"Please wait\". After a short while, we can take our money from the slot at the bottom of the machine.\nAt last, if we don't need other services, we can press the key for ending. Then our cards will come out from the slot we put it in. And we can finish our dealing and take the cards and money away.",
