  "article": "People are interested in eating raw foods or whole foods partly because eating these types of food reduces the risk of acid accumulation in our body .\nRaw and whole foods are usually digested more efficiently than cooked and processed foods . When we cook foods , we destroy the natural enzymes that are part of the food in its raw form . These enzymes were intended by nature to help us digest the food . When we consume food without these natural enzymes , our bodies either digest the food improperly or allow too many nutrients to be absorbed into the bloodstream . In both cases , the result is obesity . When too many nutrients are absorbed at once , the body grows fat .\nProcessed foods contain chemical elements , which might confuse the appetite system that tells us when we've had enough to eat ; as a result , people often overeat . Processed foods also upset the digestive cycle . The body will either identify these foods as allergens and then store them safely away from the organs as fat , or the remains of undigested food will become acidic and enter the bloodstream as acid waste , which will stick to the blood vessel walls and block the passage of vital oxygen and nutrients heading for the body's cells . The body's metabolism becomes inactive , and the result is weight gain and obesity .\nTo stop this _ circle in its tracks , people need to consume food and supplements that will balance the acid already accumulated in body . Eating the right types of raw and whole foods can help . It's also important to restore our enzyme balance . We need to identify and avoid the foods that cause acid accumulation and consume the foods that increase enzyme production . If we truly want to change and help our body heal itself , we need to take an active approach .",
