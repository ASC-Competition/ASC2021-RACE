Everything was new and strange to him, because he had never traveled to the city before.\nThe old farmer visited a lot of interesting places in the city.\nHe rushed into a large tall building and saw a lift. When he was watching, an old woman got into the lift and closed the door. After a while, the door opened again and a very perfect young girl came out.\nThe old farmer was very surprised, \"What a funny little room!\" He said to himself, \"It's magic.
