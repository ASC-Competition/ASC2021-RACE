  "article": "LEEDS, England--- A Leeds University psychology professor is teaching a course to help dozens of Bristons forgive their enemies.\n\"The hatred we hold within us is a cancer,\" Professor Ken Hart said, adding that holding in anger can lead to problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease.\nMore than seventy people have become members in Hart's first 20-week workshop in London--- a course he says is the first of its kind in the world.\nThese are people who are sick and tired of living with a memory. They realize their bitterness is a poison they think they can pour out, but they end up drinking it themselves, said Canadian- born Hart.\nThe students meet in groups of eight to ten for a two-hour workshop with an adviser every fortnight.\nThe course, ending in July, is expected to get rid of the cancer of hate in these people. \"People have lots of the attitudes towards forgiveness,\" he said. \"People confuse forgiveness with forgetting. Forgiveness means changing from a negative attitude to a positive one.\"\nHart and his team have created instructions to provide the training needed.\n\"The main idea is to give you guidelines on how to look at various kinds of angers and how they affect you, and how to change your attitudes towards the person you're angry with,\" said Norman Claringbull, a senior expert on the forgiveness project. Hart said he believes forgiveness is a skill that can be taught, as these people \"want to get free of the past.\"",
