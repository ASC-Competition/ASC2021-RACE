Or are you afraid that your friend would laugh at you, or just can't understand what you are going through?\nAnne Frank chose the first kind. She lived in Amsterdam during World War II. Her family was Jewish   so they had to hide, or they would be caught by the German soldiers. She and her family hid away for two years before they were discovered. During this time the only true friend was her diary, which she called Kitty.\nIn a diary dated on Thursday 15 June, 1944, she wrote, \"Dear Kitty, I wonder if it's because I haven't been able to be outdoors for so long that I've grown so mad about everything to do with nature. I can well remember that there was a time when a blue sky, the song of the birds, moonlight and flowers could never have kept me puzzled. That's changed since I was here for a year and a half.\"",
