  "article": "Most people buy a lot of gifts just before Christmas. But some people think we  buy too much. They have started a special day called Buy Nothing Day. They don t want anyone to go shopping on that day.\nBuy Nothing Day is on November 29th. It is 25 days before Christmas. At that time, we see ads in newspapers and on TV telling us to \"buy,buy, buy!\"\nThe idea for Buy Nothing Day started in Vancouver, British Columbia. Now people all over the world celebrate Buy Nothing Day. In California, USA, parents and children get together to read stories, sing songs and paint pictures. The children talk about why they don t need many toys. Last year, in Manchester, England, people dressed up in costumes to tell people that we buy too much.\nIn Albuquerque, New Mexico,high school students wanted to tell other students about Buy Nothing Day. They organized a dinner to give people information about Buy Nothing Day. They asked restaurants in the neighbours to donate the food. They put up posters and talked to other students about it. The dinner was a big success, many students liked the idea of this new tradition. This year, they want to have another dinner to tell more people about Buy Nothing Day.",
