  "article": "Every successful independence movement needs a leader. The leader of the Indian independence movement was Mohandas Gandhi. He was born into a Hindu family. As a young man, Gandhi studied law in London. The Hindu leaders had threatened to punish him. But he went to London anyhow.\nGandhi believed in fighting without weapons or force. He called his method non-violence . He would simply disobey any unfair law or policy. He was willing to be punished for his actions. Gandhi thought that the law would be changed if enough people protested   in this way. It would show how strongly the people felt about his beliefs.\nGandhi wanted all Indians to understand the independence movement. He walked barefoot through the villages, speaking to all people. Many people loved and understood Gandhi. His movement grew. The British flag came down in 1947.\nThe Indian people honored Gandhi with the title Mahatma, which means \"Great soul\". Gandhi was an unusual kind of leader. He promised never to make money for himself. He always wore simple clothes and sandals. He was shot and killed in 1948. At his death, he owned little more than a few clothes, his eyeglasses, a book, and his rice bowl.",
