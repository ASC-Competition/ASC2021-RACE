  "article": "Father Maurice Chase used a special way to celebrate his 90th birthday. The Catholic priest took $ 15,000 in cash to Los Angeles' gutter  and gave it away. Twenty wheelchair-bound people received $100 bills, while the rest received $1to $ 3 each.\n\"I come out here to tell them that God loves them and I love them and that someone is concerned about them,\" Chase said.\nChase has given away cash and blessings every Sunday at the same corner for 24 years. Several hundred people wait for him every week.\nHe makes a point of coming on Thanksgiving and Christmas, too, but this is the first year he spent his birthday in the downtown neighborhood where people live mainly in shelters and on dirty sidewalks.\n\"It's the place that makes me the happiest.I just love it,\" said Chase. \"I look forward to coming here.\"\nThe money comes from donations he receives from rich and famous people he met during his work as assistant to the president of Loyola Marymount University.\nThe crowd broke into choruses of \"Happy Birthday\" several times. Some people presented him birthday cards, to his delight.\nTravis Kemp, a 51-year-old disabled man with long black hair, was one of the lucky 20 to receive $ 100. He said he had no special plans for spending the money. \"He has a lot of respect from me,\" Kemp said. \"I know I couldn't do it.\"",
