  "article": "As a middle school student, you are in an age group that is both fascinating and complex. You are no longer a \"baby\", but you are not yet an adult. You are experiencing biological, physical, and behavioral and social changes. Relationships with your friends and family take on new meanings. This time period, called adolescence, can be joyful and painful at the same time. However, it is always a time of growth. You will be dealing with more complex intellectual tasks. You will be expected to behave in a more mature manner and you will be held more responsible for your actions. In other words, you are growing up. Use your curiosity, imagination, energy, and idealism to make your school an exciting place to learn and play.\nAs an adolescent, you now have more control over how you apply yourself to your school work and on the kinds of friends you make. As an intelligent and thinking adolescent, be aware of health risks to avoid such as involvement with drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and sexual activity. This involvement reduces your quality of life. Be kind and gentle to yourself, seek the advice and wisdom of your parents/guardians regularly, and talk with your teachers and school counselor.\nMiddle school students are expected to be respectful and considerate of others. You are responsible for your behavior. Think of ways to improve your behavior\n^in your classroom\n^in the lunchroom\n^on school grounds\n^during school activities\n^on the school bus\n^in your community\nIf you need assistance in working on ways to improve yourself as a person, contact your counselor. The counselor is trained to help students solve personal problems.",
