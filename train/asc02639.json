  "article": "When her five daughters were young, Helene An always told them that there was strength in unity  .To show this, she pick up one chopstick, taking it as one person.Then she easily broke it into two pieces.Next, she tied several chopsticks together, taking them as a family.She showed the girls it was hard to break the tied chopsticks.This lesson about family unity stayed with the daughters as they grew up\nHelene An and her family own a large restaurant business in California.However, when Helene and her husband Danny left their home in Vietnam in 1975, they didn't have much money.They moved their family to San Francisco.There they joined Danny's mother, Diana, who owned a small Italian sandwich shop.Soon afterwards, Helene and Diana changed the sandwich shop into a small Vietnamese restaurant.The five daughters helped in the restaurant when they were young.However, Helene did not want her daughters to always work in the family business because she thought it was too hard.\nEventually the girls all graduated from college and went away to work for themselves, but one by one, the daughters returned to work in the family business.They opened new restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles.Even though family members sometimes disagreed with each other, they worked together to make the business successful.Daughter Elisabeth explains, \"Our mother taught us that to succeed we must have unity, and to have unity we must have peace.Without the strength of the family, there is no business.\"\nWith three generations of Ans working together, now the Ans'business makes more than $20 million each year.Although they began with a small restaurant, they had big dreams, and they worked together.Now they are a big success.",
