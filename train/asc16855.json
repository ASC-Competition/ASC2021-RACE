  "article": "Over a hundred years ago people in London were surprised to see a very unusual boat come sailing up the Thames River.The boat was eighty feet long flat-bottomed,with big wooden eyes on both sides in the front and was colorfully painted at the back.\nPeople came to know that it was a sailing boat from Fuzhou in distant China.The boat had sailed round the Cape of Good Hope  up the western coast of Africa,and finally to England.It had covered fifteen thousand miles--more than half of the distance round the world.\nAlthough it was unexpected,the Chinese were warmly welcomed.The boat carried goods such as silk and tea as well as a number of gifts from the Emperor of China for the Queen of England.\nPeople had always mistakenly thought of the Chinese as a people not used to sea.However,from centuries of trading and sailing in dangerous seas,the Chinese had learned how to build good boats and sailed them well.The coming of this sailing boat to London proved once again that the Chinese could sail to distant countries in the world.",
