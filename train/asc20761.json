Parents should help children to build their confidence and achievements. Parents should also play the role of a friend as well as a teacher in children's education.\nLearning about math or reading isn't the only problem we face in school. Maybe we are having problems with teachers, classmates or other people. At this time we really need a person who is ready to hear what we are thinking. And the person should be you---my dear parents.
