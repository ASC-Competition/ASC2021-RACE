  "article": "Today's modern life discourages people from taking time to prepare their own meals. Eating in the car and grabbing a quick bite in a restaurant are ever more popular ways of dining. It takes a little extra effort and time to cook your own food, but it's a worthwhile pursuit that can benefit your health, wallet and family.\nPeople across the country are waking up to the fact that the food offered by most fast food restaurants isn't particularly healthy. While these restaurants have made attempts lately to add healthier meals to their menus, it's still _ a dish cooked with fresh ingredients  and personal care.\nNutritionists who study what is called \"the French paradox\"--- meaning the fact that French people have low obesity rates despite their diet containing lots of \"unhealthy\" ingredients such as butter---partially account for this circumstance by the fact that many French people use fresh ingredients. Taking time to eat at a leisurely pace also helps you get better nutrition and you are less likely to pack on the pounds.\nEven a quick meal will usually cost at least five dollars per person at a restaurant. Compare this to the amount of pasta, vegetables or meat available for the same money at your home, and it quickly becomes apparent that the cost of eating out adds up.\nExperimenting with new ingredients or foreign recipes will encourage children to try new foods and learn about dishes from around the world. Many couples also find that preparing a meal together can be a romantic experience equal to dinner in a classy, low-lit restaurant. Make sure to spend meal times talking and sharing events from the day and you may find it's a great way to get to know your family better.",
