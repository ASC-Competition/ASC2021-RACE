  "article": "Richard Branson, an English business magnate, has had great, global success. He is best known as the founder of Virgin Group, which consists of more than 400 companies.\nSo what, I asked, is his most important secret to success? His answer was simple: look for the best in other people.\nThroughout his life he's never thought ill of other people. He looks for the best and praises them. Branson at times seems almost not human. He's too good at what he does. No, great. Nearly perfect. When he starts something, he is very likely to succeed. He has fallen out with others though, like anyone else. He is human. He told me:\"Life is short and the world is much smaller than one realizes. You are going to come across people time and time again in the most surprising places ... As a leader it's even more important to be out there praising and encouraging people. If you do fall out with somebody in life, even if you think it was their mistake, give them a call. Befriend them. Go out to lunch with them.\"\nThe greatest leaders in the world have taught forgiveness. Perhaps the most extreme example is Nelson Mandela who invited his former prison guard to his inauguration   and even had lunch with a man who in the past wanted him to be sentenced to death.\nLife is too short. We are humans and sometimes we make mistakes and anger people. What defines us is not those who are able to avoid confrontation  , but those who are able to deal with it. The human body is able to self-heal when we are cut. In that same manner, we must heal our past relationships.\nBranson wins respect from those around him. A natural-born leader, he is always deep in thought and hungry for more; always one step ahead. And it was Richard Branson who taught me about forgiveness.",
