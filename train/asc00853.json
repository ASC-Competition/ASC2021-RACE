  "article": "As society advances and basic needs are most often being met, things that were not considered important in the past have taken priority . In the past, people could easily get a job and progress pretty well, as long as they were hard-working; education was important but not as crucial  as it is today.\nNowadays, just as clothes are important to first impressions, degree is important to a person's first job interview or even a job with a good salary. Although experience is important to survive in any trade or profession, the first thing that companies look for is that piece of paper before looking at one's experience.\nA passport into the world of any profession is what having a degree means today, especially for professions that have need of certification and pay well, such as architects, doctors, lawyers, and teachers.\nThat piece of paper, the degree, is also a passport to jobs in top or middle management in any company, especially so for multi-national corporations . Having a degree opens up opportunities that one would not have had if one did not have any kind of degree. A degree simply proves that one has gone through the necessary training and understanding of how to carry out a job.\nAlthough there are many that may say having a degree may not necessarily equal to success, _ would most definitely help any person achieve success in shorter and easier steps. Success cannot simply be a result of hard work and/or depending on one's experience or degree alone; it is the art and knowledge of how to work that determines one's success. Therefore, it should not be for the sake to get a degree, but the quality of the degree and experiences that one can learn from that matter as well.",
