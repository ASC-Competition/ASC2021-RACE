  "article": "For most Chinese university students, the prefix = st1 /USis a favorite destination for further education. But apart from obstacles such as the GRE and TOEFL exams, choosing a good graduate school is no easy task. \nAdmission is very competitive for international students, so it is important to apply to a number of institutions to have a reasonable chance of acceptance. \nSince the application to most universities requires a certain fee, Chinese students usually choose seven to 17 universities according to their own financial circumstances. \nWang Yuwei, a Zhejiang University graduate, sent applications to 15 USuniversities. \nWhen the 24-year-old began looking for a USgraduate school in her senior year, she took time to compare the various schools and find the ones most suiting her needs. Now, studying at theUniversityofWashington, she knows that her hard work paid off. \n\"To broaden your chances, at least one third of the applications should be to less selective schools,\" said Wang. \"Applicants shouldn't limit their choices to the most famous institutions.\" \nFurthermore, one shouldn't rely on too much on college rankings such as the Gorman Report or US News & World Report's annual league tables. \nThe right school is the one that best meets your own personal needs and interests, rather than someone else's assessment of an institution's prestige . \n\"Usually choices are based on one's personal interests and academic background, but it is important to make sure that your chosen subject is satisfied,\" said Wang.",
