Locke's new position is clearly a sign that US President is trying to improve relations with China.\nWhen he made his first speech to the Chinese press in Beijing, Locke said, \" I think, being a Chinese-American, I have a greater understanding of the US government.\"\nBefore becoming ambassador to China, Locke was US secretary of commerce  . This means he has plenty of trade experience, which will be useful in building economic links between the two countries.\nLocke's grandfather went to the United States over a century ago to work as a houseboy for a family in Washington State in exchange for English lessons. His father moved to US as a teenager.\n\"I'm going back to the birthplace of my grandfather, my father and my mom, and I'll be doing so as a devoted diplomat   for America, the country where I was born and raised,\" Locke said.\n,A.B.C.D .
