  "article": "\"I'm a little worried about my future.\"said Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate.He should be so lucky.All he had to worry about was whether to have an affair with Mrs. Robinson.In the sixties,that was the total sum of post-graduation anxiety.\nHoffman's modem peers are not so fortunate.The Mrs. Robinsons aren't sitting around at home any more.They are out in the workplace,doing the high-powered jobs the graduates want,but cannot get.For those fresh out of university,desperate for work but unable to get it,there is a big imbalance between supply and demand.And there is no narrowing of the gap in sight.\nParents feel as badly let down as the young people themselves.Middle-class families see their graduate offspring on the dole   queue and wonder why they bothered paying school fees.Working-class families feel an even keener sense of disappointment.For many such families,getting a child into university was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.It was proof that they were living in a dynamic,economically successful country.That dream does not seem so rosy now.Graduate unemployment is not,ultimately,a political problem.Job-creation for graduates is very low down in the government's schedule.If David Cameron's Conservatives   had a brilliant idea for guaranteeing every graduate a well-paid job,they would have presented it by now.It is a social problem,though a more deep-seated social problem than people perhaps realize.",
