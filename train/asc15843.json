  "article": "Are you looking for something fun and would you like to help others in your spare time? Then join us to be a volunteer! We're a non-profit   organization. We have volunteer jobs of all ages. Anyone, from twelve-year-old children to people in their seventies can become a volunteer.\nYou can help people in many ways. Schools need help with taking care of children while parents are working. Hospitals need volunteers to look after children while their parents are seeing a doctor. Animal lovers can help take care of those dogs and cats without homes. There is something for everyone.\n\"As a volunteer, I don't want to get anything. Seeing the children's happy faces, I'm happy, too.\" Said Carlos Domingo, an old woman of 62. \"I often played computer games in my spare time before. Now I help older people learn how to use computers.\" said another volunteer at the age of 18.\nIf everyone helps out a bit, we'll have a better world to live in. Interested? Call us 1-800-555-5756 or visit our website: www.activol.com.",
