  "article": "Dear Alice,\nI heard from you three days ago. I'm all right.\nGood news! We moved to a new flat yesterday! There are more rooms here than in our old one. You know, I shared a room with my sister in the old flat. But now I have my own bedroom! It is small but it's my favorite room! I can be alone in it. I can read books, draw pictures, listen to my radio and play CDs. I can also play games on my computer and send e-mails to my friends.\nI also love the new bigger kitchen. I love helping my mother with our meals. Mom cooks well. She always teaches me how to make different kinds of dishes. She lived in China when she was young, so she can cook Chinese food. It's delicious.\nWrite to me soon and tell me about your home. Please get on the Internet so that we can chat with each other.\nAll good wishes!",
