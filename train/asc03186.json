  "article": "When you want to find a job, you have to face the employer and you must know how to introduce yourself well. Then you will be lucky enough.\nThe first impressions can play a major role in how an employer like you as a candidate . What you say during the first step of the interview may make a big difference. In fact, some hiring managers may make a decision to refuse a candidate based on what they didn't do when you met them. That's why it's important to pay attention to interview manners and to carefully think through how you will introduce yourself during a job interview.\nWhen arriving at the interview site you can introduce yourself to the receptionist   by giving your name and telling the purpose of your visit. For example: \"My name is Tim Jones and I have an interview scheduled with John Smith at 2 pm.\" You will be guided into the interview room or the hiring manager will come out to meet you in the reception area. Again, take the time to introduce yourself so the interviewer knows who you are.\nOffer to shake hands, even if the interviewer doesn't offer his hand first. Tell the interviewer that it is a pleasure to meet him. Smile, and be sure to make eye contact.\nMany hiring managers will start an interview with an open-ended question like \"Tell me\nabout yourself.\" Your response should focus on the key elements in your background. You should carefully analyze the job first to the interviewer, and you can point out the interests, skills, experiences, and personal qualities.\nYour introduction should be brief enough to hold the interest of the interviewer so that you can move on to the next question. Your goal is to connect personally with the interviewer as well as to show that you're qualified for the job. Of course, your comments should show your enthusiasm for the job and organization. However, don't overdo it and don't spend too much time talking about yourself.",
