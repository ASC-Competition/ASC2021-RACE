  "article": "New research has shown that loneliness may affect ants to a greater extent than many other living creatures.\nIt has long been known that loneliness can lead to a shorter life. In humans, it has even been found to be a driver of high blood pressure, sleep disorder, and depression that's independent of factors like age, race, gender, weight and economic status.\nHowever, loneliness has never been identified as a factor that can cut human lifespan by more than a small part of the average. Ants, on the other hand, appear to be far more sensitive to this stress, with loneliness leading to a surprising 91 percent reduction in lifespan.\nThat's at least according to a study that details how \"lonely\" ants only live up to six days on average. Ants living in a community, on the other hand, were found to live up to about 66 days.\nIn a series of experiments where ants were picked from their colonies   and separated, they were found to continuously walk without rest,consuming far more energy than they could ever.\nThe reason for the behavior is that an isolated ant is simple trying to get back to its colony at all costs, and doesn't know what to do without its nest mates. After all, many entomologists   would argue that an ant colony is far more a single living entity   than its members.\nIf you were to take a single part from a clock, it would simply move aimlessly as well, running without a purpose. However, while there is a difference between aimlessness and loneliness, the researchers found that the latter affects lonely ants more directly.\nThe study indicated that ants can't even eat alone, as they normally collect some of the food they gather in the field in a specialized organ called a crop.This crop is normally shared with other ants back at a nest,but as for a single ant, it simply just sits there, undigested and useless.",
