  "article": "How would you describe Quincy Jones? Is he an instrumentalist, a composer, an arranger, or a producer? None of these labels can sum up this remarkable man. He has been known for years to people who follow popular music. But his part in the We Are the World VCD and the Hands Across America project made him a national figure.\nIn addition to these successful efforts, Jones has written the music for many cartoon movies, including The Color Purple, which won 11 Oscar nominations . He also wrote the music for Alex Haley's Roots, a greatly successful television mini--series. These achievements show his many-sided genius.\nQuincy Jones was born on March 14, 1973, in Chicago's South Side. Ten years later, his family moved to the Seattle area. It was there that he met Ray Charles, who was three years older than ones and who in time would be a world-famous singer. The young musicians performed at small clubs and weddings. Through Charles's influence, Jones began composing.\nWhen Jones was only 15, his musical talent impressed Lionel Hampton, who invited him to join the Hampton band. Jones was ready to quit school to join, but Hampton's wife, Gladys, stated her disagreement. Believing that he needed an education, she removed him from the band's bus. \"Get that child out of here,\" she yelled, \"Let him finish school.\"\nThese experiences made Quincy Jones more determined than ever to success. He finished high school, attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston on a scholarship, and finally did Lionel Hampton's band. Soon, however, he struck off on his own. The future beckoned  brightly.",
