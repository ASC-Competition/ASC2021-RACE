  "article": "An ancient Egyptian mummy thought to be that of Pharaoh Ramses I has returned home after more than 140 years in North American museums. The body was carried off the plane in Cairo in a box covered in Egypt's flag.\nThe Michael Carlos Museum gave it back after tests showed it was probably that of the man who ruled 3,000 years ago. The US museum acquired it three years ago from a Canadian museum, which in turn is thought to have bought it from Egyptian garve robbers in 1860. The mummy was welcomed back home with songs and military band music during a ceremony at the national museum in Cairo.\nZahi Hawass, head of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities , traveled from the US with the body and said it would be moved next year to the Luxor Museum in southern Egypt. \"We are not 100% sure that mummy is that of Ramses I,\" said Mr. Hawass. \"But we are 100% sure that it is of a king.\"\nAtlanta's Michael Carlos Museum acquired the mummy in 1999, but offered to return it after hi-tech scanning equipment indicated it was likely to be that of Ramses I. The museum website said it had been acquired from the Niagara Falls Museum. It is thought a Canadian collector bought the mummy for the Niagara Falls Museum around 1860 from an Egyptian family which had came across a tomb filled with royal mummies at a site near Luxor.\nMr. Hawass praised the handover as \"a great, civilized gesture\". And he appealed to other world museums to return Egypt's antiquities, particularly the Rosetta Stone in the Britain Museum and the Bust of Nefertiti in the Berlin Museum.",
