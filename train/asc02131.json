  "article": "Even if he is not the most liked comedian in China today, his popularity certainly has risen the fastest within the last two months.\nHe's \"Little Shenyang\", who came into national fame overnight after his appearance on CCTV's Spring Festival Gala. With his funny cross-dressing, unique northeastern accent and superb imitative  skills, Little Shenyang has obvious talent to support his rise to fame.\nHundreds of video clips of his shows have been posted on YouTube and other online video sites, and his performance fees reportedly grew 50-fold in just a few weeks. He has, at the same time, become one of the most controversial of entertainers.\nMany have doubted his artistic potential, pointing out that his shows were repetitive and lacked creativity, a key to continued comedic success. Others belittle   the style of humor, saying it's too crude and appeals only to less-educated people. His defenders were just as up in arms. Many media commentators and bloggers said that his quick rise to star proved the broad appeal of his art form. He became a national champion not because of his \"northeastern hick \" humor, they argued, but because he represented something new on TV, something with a grassroots feel that appealed to millions of ordinary people.\nNow, does Little Shenyang really deserve his star status?",
