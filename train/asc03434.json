  "article": "Backpacking in Europe is a wonderful experience for young people around the world.After high school or university,you can plan a European backpacking trip.\nPacking\nAs you plan the things you will carry,bring warm clothes and a raincoat or umbrella to deal with changing weather in different European countries.Europeans like dressing nicely,and good clothes will make you feel less like a dusty  backpacker.It is not worth taking the trouble to bring a hair dryer or shampoo,as you can buy basic necessities  in Europe.\nHostels\nThe cheapest places to sleep when backpacking in Europe are hostels(where people can stay and eat fairly cheaply).Most hostels have a lot of information about low-cost ways to see local attractions,and many offer tours.The cost for hostel beds differs from country to country.In Paris,you might pay 30 euros,but in Bulgaria,you can get a bed for 10 euros.In general,hostels are more expensive in large,popular cities such as Paris,Rome and London.\nMany backpackers use rail passes ,which allow unlimited  travel within country groups over a period of time.If you have the time to travel by train and will be traveling in a country group,this can be a good deal.Otherwise,you may consider point-to-point tickets,local trains,buses and airlines such as Ryanair,easyJet and Wizz Air,which offer cheap flights.\nFood\nEating out in Europe can come with a high cost,and the best way to cut your food budget  is to cook meals in the shared kitchens in hostels.You can make several meals into picnics to take advantage of Europe's parks.When shopping for your picnic,try and buy at a local market.You save some euros while supporting the local industry at the same time.When eating out,choose restaurants away from tourist attractions.",
