  "article": "My name is Max. I am twelve years old. I have many friends. Most of them are as old as I. Some are older. Some are younger.\nMy best friend is Bill. He lives near me. We go to the same school and we are in the same class. Bill helps me with my math homework. I help him with his English homework. Bill is taller than me. He is quite fat. He doesn't like sports, so he doesn't get much exercise. We both have black eyes, but Bill's hair is longer. I like sports and I play football or go swimming every day. Every Sunday morning Bill and I play computer games. Sometimes I win. Sometimes he wins.\n,,2B.",
