  "article": "There was once a guy who suffered from cancer, a cancer that can't be cured. One day he was sick of staying home and wanted to go out. He passed a CD store and looked through the front door for a second. He saw a beautiful girl about his age and he knew it was love at first sight. He opened the door and walked in, not looking at anything else but her. He walked closer and closer until he was finally at the front desk where she sat.\nShe looked up and asked, \"Can I help you?\" She smiled and he thought it was the most beautiful smile he had ever seen before. He said, \"UH...Yeah...Umm... I would like to buy a CD.\" He picked one out and gave her money for it. \"Would you like me to pack it for you?\" she asked, smiling her cute smile again. He nodded and she went to the back. She came back with the packed CD and gave it to him.\nFrom then on, he went to that store every day and bought a CD. He took the CD home and put it in his closet. He was still too shy to ask her out. His mother found out about this and encouraged him. So the next day, he took all his courage and left his phone number on the desk before he ran out.\nSeveral weeks later the phone rang, and the mother picked it up. It was the girl!!! The mother started to cry and said, \"You don't know? He passed away yesterday...\" Later that day, the mother went into the boy's room and opened the closet. Inside were piles and piles of unopened CDs. She picked one up and opened it. Out fell a piece of paper, saying: \"Do you want to go out with me? Love, Jocelyn.\" The mother was deeply moved and opened another CD... Again, there was a piece of paper with the same words.",
