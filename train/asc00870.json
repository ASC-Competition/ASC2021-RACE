  "article": "\"Holding girls back from an education is robbing them of their dignity  ,\" says Mariam, a teacher, in an interview with Action Press.\n\"I feel proud when I tell people that I'm from Swat in Pakistan, with its green and mountainous valley. But I don't feel proud about the number of women and girls where I'm from who are still being unable to enjoy the right for an education.\n\"I have taught many students -- including Malaya, the young education activist who was shot in the head as travelling to school in Pakistan after campaigning for girls' education. Among them I see the dignity that education can offer. This is why I have long been devoted to teaching, and why I am doing what I can to make sure that all girls have the chance to go to school.\n\"At the Khushaal school and college in Mingora, many girls are prevented from going to school because of poverty and fights. However, the most common reasons for girls not attending classes are cultural. People fear that females will become too independent if educated. Instead, parents prefer to marry off girls early. Girls and young women are considered a financial burden if left dependent on their parents.\"\n\"In the school where I have been teaching for over ten years, I have seen how this discrimination plays out. Parents regard an educated and independent female as being too clever for her own. Even if parents agree to give a girl an education, a limit is set to the number of years for her to attend classes and it is common for girls to make it through only primary school. This is why I have been working tirelessly to change these damaging views and cultural practices. These are crimes against humanity  ,which I have no choice but to strongly accuse of.\"\n\"Malala was right to fight for her education.\" says Mariam, who will be in New York with UNESCO  , delivering a speech calling for world leaders to make sure every child gets a chance to go to school.",
