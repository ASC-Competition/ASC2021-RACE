  "article": "For many people of Norway ,skiing  is the best way to have fun in winter. Almost everyone can ski. Children learn to ski after they learn to walk. Long long ago in Norway ,there were no buses, trains or cars. People had to find a way to walk over the deep snow. Skis were the right answer!\nAlthough they love winter, the people of Norway are also happy to see summer come. They enjoy the out-door activities at any time of the year. In summer they swim and sunbathe near the beach. Some people go hiking and go mountain climbing. Sail-boating is also very popular during the warm sunny summer months.\nThe Norwegians , like people everywhere, find many in-door ways to have a good time. During the long winter they also enjoy movies. They like to read books from the libraries in all seasons . Family life is very important to the people of Norway.",
