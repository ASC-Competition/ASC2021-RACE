  "article": "Dear Peter,\nI know that you are coming to Hefei next week. Welcome to my home. Let me tell you the way to my house. You will live in Changjiang Hotel on Changjiang Street, won't you? OK! Changjiang Street is a famous and busy street in our city. You can start from your hotel and go straight along Tongcheng Street. You pass two small streets: Hongxing Street and Lujinag Street. When you see an overbridge ,please turn right and go along Huangcheng Street. It's an old street, but it's clean. There's a big park on the street. It's beautiful and clean. When you get to Jinzhai Street, please turn left and go along it. You will pass Wuhu Street and Tunxi Street. Then you can see a KFC on your right. There's a supermarket across from the KFC and my house is near the supermarket. There's a pay phone in front of the KFC. You can call me there and I will go to meet you.\nI hope you will have a good trip.\nYours, Li Li",
