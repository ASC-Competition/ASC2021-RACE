  "article": "Student Services\nStudents' Union\nEvery University has a Students' Union. If students are the lifeblood of a university, the Union is surely its beating heart.\nFor students, by students\nA Students' Union is run by students and acts independently. At the end of each academic year, it will find six students to hold a sabbatical  position managing the Union for the coming year. That the six successful sabbatical officers have only recently experienced issues affecting students ensures that your needs are very well understood.\nLetting your hair down\nAlthough the University is spread across a fairly wide area, the Union is centrally located and is only a short walk from any of the main buildings. This makes it very easy to catch up with friends who might be on a different course.\nAt night, the place really comes alive - we have three different bars to suit every occasion. The venues are student-only so you can be sure of meeting people with a similar outlook and we throw in a transport service to make sure you get home safely.\nThe Union also organizes various formal balls throughout the year, with the highlight being the end-of-year ball.\nSupporting you\nBeyond having fun, we also make sure some of the more serious issues are effectively dealt with. If you have a problem with your course, another sabbatical officer is trained to help you. Being independent from the University means we can represent and support you to the best of our ability, and once you reach university you may find that you become aware of more national or political issues.",
