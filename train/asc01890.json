  "article": "I turned 16 on Friday, but the Driver's License Office in my small hometown was only open on Tuesday, so I had to wait through that extremely long weekend and an endless Monday before going in for my examination.\nI came to the Driver's License Office half an hour earlier _ , pacing back and forth on the worn porch waiting for the office to open at eight. I reviewed the driver's manual for the hundredth time. I was ready. I knew the manual backward and forward; I had made an \"A\" in my driver's training course, and I was a genius behind the wheel.\nFinally, the door opened and a weary-looking man in a brown uniform let me in.\n\"Let me guess. You want to take the driver's test.\" his voice was not enthusiastic.\n\"Yes!\" I answered in excitement.\n\"Ok, fill this out, and if you pass we'll go for a drive.\"\n _ . A quick check showed that my paper was perfect.\n\"Let's get in the car.\" He tossed me a set of keys, and I slid behind the wheel. Everything was going smoothly as we pulled out of the empty parking lot. I signaled a right hand turn, and we were on a deserted street. This was going to be easy.\n\"Turn left and go up Young Blood Hill,\" he ordered. My hometown is in the mountains, and Young Blood Hill was almost vertical  . As I eased up the steep hill and came to a stop at the top, I heard the car's engine die. My heart sank. I would have to start it again without rolling back down the hill. I swallowed hard and turned the key; as I moved my foot from the brake, the car began to roll. I suppose I could have rolled all the way back to the bottom except for one thing. There was something behind me which stopped my roll with a rough shake and crash of glass--a police car.\nThe policeman wrote me a ticket as I looked over the damage, and the man from the Driver's License Office slid behind the wheel. I waited until we had parked before I asked how long a person had to wait before taking the test again.",
