  "article": "After a particularly busy period at work, I decided to get away from it all by going on a hike in the mountains in southern France.\nBefore I left, I read an interesting story in a magazine. It read, \"Once, while I was riding on a crowded bus, the man sitting next to me threw his cell phone out of the window when his phone rang. I was surprised. He looked at me, shrugged   and looked away. I had no idea whether it was his or stolen or whether he even knew what a cell phone was or not, but he clearly wanted to be free of it, because it clearly troubled him. \"\nBillions of people across the world use cell phones. Though cell phones are a wonderful way for communication, they often do the exact opposite. Using cell phones can increase stress within families and friends.\nSo when I recently returned home, I got rid of my cell phone. Now I go outside without taking my phone with me. I've noticed things in my neighborhood I never noticed before, such as gardens. I've met new people, started conversations with neighbors I didn't speak to before and talked with some of my friends face to face instead of chatting over the phone.\nInstead of keeping me off from the world, stopping using my cell phone has helped me get even closer to my family and friends.",
