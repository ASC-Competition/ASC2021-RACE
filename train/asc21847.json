  "article": "Last month I had a health problem and had to see a doctor. After examining  me,\nThe doctor said to me, \"The result isn't too bad .\" But you must excise often and have healthy food every day.  In fact, I'm a lazy person. I never get up early to exercise. And I often have junk food because I like it. In order to be healthy, I decided to change my lifestyle.    Now I get up at 6:00 am every day. Then I go out to run for about an hour. I go to a gym on Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. And I hardly have junk food. I have healthy food, like milk and fish. I often eat vegetables and I have an apple every day. You know, \" An apple a day keeps the doctor away \" I also have about eight glasses of water. And I usually go to bed by ten.  All these things make me healthy.",
