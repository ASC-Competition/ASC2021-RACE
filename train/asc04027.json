  "article": "A middle-aged man with a long beard was caught by the police for bad behavior and property damage. The man, Bill Wild, checked into a hotel last night, telling the clerk he would pay cash in advance and would be staying for four nights. He then asked her where the nearest store was and she told him it was John-Johns.\nWild went to the store and bought three gallons of honey and four gallons of chocolate syrup  . The cashier asked him why he wanted these things and he replied, \"I'm trying to become a sweeter person.\" The cashier smiled at the joke. Wild drove back to the hotel. He opened all bottles and poured them into the bathtub  . He added warm water to the mix. He tuned the radio to an opera music station, took off his clothes, jumped into the tub, and started singing loudly with the music.\nFifteen minutes later, the neighbor phoned the clerk complaining about the noise. The clerk knocked on Wild's door, but he just kept singing. She phoned his room, but he didn't answer. Then she called the police, who arrived quickly. They broke into the room. The floor was covered in water and the bathtub was full of chocolate and honey. \"He seemed so nice and friendly. Who'd have thought he was a bathtub-singing nut?\" said the clerk. The police said this was the third time that Wild had been arrested for this kind of behavior.",
