  "article": "John had an accident while driving to town one day. He had his three ribs   broken and Tally, his best friend, had one leg broken. With their car damaged and no one coming to their help, they had to foot for ten miles to the town hospital.\n \"How have you got here all by yourself?\" said the doctor when he saw John in hospital. \"You have to stay in hospital at once,\" he said, \"but the dog can't. It must leave the hospital. Dogs are not allowed here.\"\n \"Please help my dog, doctor, she was hurt and she also needs a doctor!\" John said eagerly, \"or I'll leave with my dog.\" He added. He took up his coat and was ready to leave. \n \"You must be mad!\" the doctor shouted, \"You are too ill to go out!\" \"Then you must take my dog.\" John said, touching the dog's nose, and went on. \"This old dog has followed me through good times and bad times. Mostly bad times - watched me over for weeks when I was seriously ill, and once saved me from a burning house and another time she saved me from flood ...How can I leave her alone?\"\n John said and fainted  . When he came to, he looked around, \"Where's my dog?\" he asked eagerly. \"Don't worry,\" the nurse answered, \"It's in the yard. We have done something to help it.\"",
