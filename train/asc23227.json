The hotel is only 0.5 kilometer from the biggest supermarket and the subway.\nIt has three kinds of rooms  for different people to use. The first kind is standard room, that is two beds with a bathroom. It offers you the air conditioner, the television and the telephone. Second is the single room, that has only one bed. Though it has only one bed, you can enjoy yourself, for the bed is really comfortable and the environment is really good. The last one we call commercial room. That is  served for businessmen. The commercial room has the best quality. It also provides 24-hour hot water. You can have free tea in the afternoon.
