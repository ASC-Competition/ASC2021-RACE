  "article": "Beldon and Canfield are two seashore towns, not far apart. Both towns have many hotels, and in summer the hotels are full of holiday-makers and other tourists.\n   Last August there was a fire at the Seabreeze Hotel in Beldon. The next day this news appeared on Page Two of the town's newspaper, The Beldon Post.\n                             FIRE AT SEABREEZE\n   Late last night firemen hurried to the Seabreeze Hotel and quickly put out a small fire in a bedroom. The hotel manager said that a cigarette started the fire. We say again to all our visitors, \"Please don't smoke cigarettes in bed.\"  This was Beldon's first hotel fire for five years.\n   The canfield times gave the news in these words on Page One:\n                 ANOTHER BELDON HOTEL CATCHES FIRE\n   Last night Beldon firemen arrived just too late to save clothing, bedclothes and some furniture at the Seabreeze Hotel. An angry holiday-maker said, \" An electric lamp probably started the fire. The bedroom lamps are very old at some of these hotels. When I turned the bedside light on, I heard a funny noise from the lamp.\" We are glad to tell our readers that this sort of adventure does not happen in Canfield.\n   What are the facts, then? It is never easy to find out the exact truth about an accident. There was a fire at the Seabreeze Hotel 1st August: that is one fact. Do we know anything else? Yes, we know that firemen went to the hotel.",
