  "article": "If a husband accuses his wife of missing the bigger picture or the wife says her husband has no eye for detail,there may be more than an element of truth to it.\nScientists have shown that men are better at dealing with distant targets,while women are good at shortrange focusing.\nThe finding reflects  the way men and women's brains evolved thousands of years ago. Hunters,usually the men,needed the ability to find targets in far places. Women,on the other hand,had to _ searching the area immediately within reach for fruits,nuts,berries and roots.\nResearchers asked 48 men and women to mark the midpoint of lines on a piece of paper with a laser  pointer. Men were more accurate than women when the target was placed at a distance of 100cm or out of reach. When the paper was only 50cm away--within hands' reach--the women did a much better job.\nPsychologist Helen Stancey,from Hammersmith and West London College,said,\"Evidence already exists that separate pathways in the brain process visual  information from near and far space. Our results suggest that the near pathways is favored in women and the far pathway is favored in men. \"The findings are published online in the British Journal of Psychology.\nIn a second study,volunteers were asked to carry out the same tasks by using a stick. This time women were much better than men at judging both distances. The finding suggests that the stick provides a focal point to help the brain to process distant information as if it is in the near space.",
