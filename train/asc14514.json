  "article": "Today almost everyone knows computers and the Internet. If I ask you \"What is the most important in your life ?\" maybe you will say \"Computers and the Internet.\"\nThe first computer was made in 1946. It was very big but it worked slowly . Today computers are getting smaller and smaller. But they work faster and faster. What can computers do?\nA writer has said, \"people can't live without computers today.\"\nThe Internet came a little later than computers. It is about twenty-five years later than computers. But now it can be found almost everywhere. We can use it to read books, write letters, do shopping, play games or make friends.\nMany students like the Internet very much. They often go into the Internet as soon as they are free. They make friends on the Internet and maybe they have never seen these friends. They don't know their real names, ages, and even sex  . They are so interested in making the \"unreal friends\" that they can't put their hearts into study. Many of them can't catch up with others on many subjects because of that.\nWe can use computers and the Internet to learn more about the world. But at the same time, we should remember that not all the things can be done by computers and the Internet.",
