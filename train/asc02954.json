  "article": "Jeremy was born with a twisted body, and terminal illness slowly killing him throughout his young life. Still, his parents had tried to give him as normal a life as possible and had sent him to St. Theresa's Elementary School.\nAt the age of 12, Jeremy was only in second grade, seemingly unable to learn. His teacher, Doris Miller, often became angry with him. He would often disturb the class by squirming  in his seat, drooling  and making grunting noises. Doris had 18 other youngsters to teach and she didn't want to waste time on Jeremy.\nSpring came, and the children talked excitedly about the coming of Easter. Doris told them of the story of Jesus, and stressed the idea of new life springing forth, she gave each of them a large plastic egg. \"Now,\" she said to them, \"I want you to take this home and bring it back tomorrow with something inside that shows new life. Do you understand?\" \"Yes, Miss Miller!\" All the children responded except Jeremy. He just listened, his eyes never left her face. He did not even make his usual noises.\nThe next morning, the children came to school and placed their eggs in a large basket on Doris' desk. After they completed their Math lesson, it was time to open the eggs.\nIn the first egg, Doris found a flower. \"Oh yes, a flower is certainly a sign of new life,\" she said. The next egg had a plastic beautiful butterfly in it. Then Doris opened the fourth egg. It was empty! Surely it must be Jeremy's she thought, and he did not understand the instructions.\nShe put that egg down so she wouldn't embarrass him. Suddenly Jeremy spoke up and said \"Aren't you going to talk about my egg?\" Doris replied, \"But Jeremy - your egg is empty!\" He looked into her eyes and said softly, \"Yes, but Jesus' tomb was empty too!\"\nDoris asked him, \"Do you know why the tomb was empty?\" \"Oh yes!\" Jeremy exclaimed. \"Jesus was killed and put there. Then His Father raised Him up!\"\nAfter class the children excitedly ran out, but Doris cried. The cold inside her melted completely away.\nThree months later, Jeremy died. Those who paid their respects at the funeral were surprised to see 19 eggs on top of Jeremy's casket, all of them empty.",
