  "article": "Some places in the world have strange laws. It's important for you to know about them before going there.\nWhoever likes to chew gum  may have to leave Singapore. The government really wants to keep the city clean and will fine you for chewing gum.\nBefore you leave for the United Arab Emirates you'd better make sure you aren't visiting during Ramadan . During that time you aren't allowed to eat or drink in public. Tourists have been fined up to $275 for drinking in public.\nLovers spend so much time kissing each other goodbye at train stations that trains often start late. This law -- no kissing your lover goodbye at train stations - is rather old, and isn't in use today in France.\nIn Thailand it's against the law to drive a car or motorcycle without a shirt on, no matter how hot it is. Punishments are different in different areas and can include warnings and tickets costing about $10. No joke -- the local police will stop you.\nStudies in Denmark have shown that cars with their headlights on are more noticeable by other drivers than those with their headlights off. Drivers there are required to leave their headlights on even during the day, or they may face a fine up to $100.\nDo you often buy things using coins? Don't do it in Canada. The Currency Law of 1985 doesn't allow using only coins to buy things. Even the use of the dollar-coin is limited  . The shop owner has the right to choose whether to take your coins or not.\nMake sure you know about these laws before your next trip. Better safe than sorry.",
