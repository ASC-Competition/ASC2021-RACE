Go to a quiet country place for a month, go to bed early, drink milk, walk a lot, and smoke only one cigar  a day.\"\nA month later, the Indian came to see the doctor again. \"How are you?\" said the doctor. \"I'm glad to see you again. You look much younger.\" \"Oh, doctor, I feel quite well now,\" said the Indian, \"I had a good rest. I went to bed early. I drank a lot of milk. I walked a lot. You certainly helped me. But you told me to smoke one cigar a day, and that almost  killed me at first. It was not easy to begin smoking at my age.\"",
