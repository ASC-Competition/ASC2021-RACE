  "article": "Liu Hui is very excited. The students in a school in Shanghai will go to the USA with his parents during the Spring Festival.\n\"Overseas touring has always been a dream for me,\" he said happily.\nNowadays, Chinese people enjoy longer holidays, such as the three \"Golden Week Holidays\"(the Spring Festival, May Day and National Day). They have more time to travel. Rising incomes also make travelling abroad realistic for ordinary Chinese people.\nNearly 7 million Chinese travelled overseas in 2001, according to the National Tourism Administration . The most common problem travellers face is how to choose the best routes .\nBy the end of 2002, Chinese citizens were allowed to travel to 19 foreign countries and regions at their own expense.\nThe top 10 places included Hong Kong, Macao and Thailand. European countries are also becoming increasingly popular.\n\"More and more Chinese people have shown interest in travelling to Europe, particularly France and Finland,\" said Tan Wen, a general manager of China Youth Travel Service. \"Sooner or later, there will be a peak  in European tours.\"\nAnother consideration is choosing the right travel agencies and finding the best price. The China Consumers' Association(CCA,)offered tips to consumers on choosing the right travel agencies to help prevent a relaxing vacation from turning into a costly disaster.\n\"Price should not be the single most important factor in choosing a travel agency,\" said Zhang Yuanchao, CCA vice-secretary general. Consumers are advised to choose large State travel agencies with good reputations and official approval to organize overseas tour groups.\nZhang's association dealt with more than 5, 000 complaints about travel agencies  last year. And the majority of the complaints were about _ in travel routes, bad tour guides, and forced shopping.\nTravellers were warned to look carefully at their contracts with agencies and to buy travel insurance .",
