  "article": "How many men do housework? Recently a European commission  tried to find out people's ideas and reactions to the women's movement. As part of their survey , they asked many men and women the question, \"Who does the housework?\" The men answered very differently from the women!\nThe housework they asked people about was: preparing meals, washing dishes, cleaning the house and babysitting. 48% of British husbands said they did these things. 37% of Danish  men helped in the house. But only 15% of Italian men said they did the housework; many of them said they never helped at all!\nBut there was an interesting point of view from the wives. According to British wives, only 38% of their husbands helped in the house. And Italian wives said that their husbands hardly ever helped. The Italian and British men did not tell the truth! The Commission found that Danish men were the most truthful husbands; their answers were the same as their wives' answers.\nDo the men you know help in the house? Do you think the survey gives a true picture in your experience? Write and tell us what you think.",
