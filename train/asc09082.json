  "article": "Zoe was just 2 weeks old when she was seen wandering in a village market wax Kenya's Tsavo National Park in December 1995.Zoe's mother had died and the baby was left alone, She was no ordinary orphan  --she was an elephant.So she was sent to a most unusual orphanage in Nairobi, run by a woman named Daphne Sheldrick,\nDaphne's husband, David Sheldrick, founded Tsavo National Park.Daphne has been working with wild animals for some 60 years, and in 1977 she opened the elephant orphanage at her home in Nairobi.Since 1997, the orphanage, which depends on private contributions, has saved more than 100 baby elephants,\nZoe was rather healthy when she was found, and once under the care of the orphanage she was very happy, having enough milk a day and being confident and naughty.After a year in the orphanage with the constant companionship of her human family, Zoe was taken to a refuge   at Tsavo National Park.There her keepers have gradually introduced her to the ways of the wild, helping her to find food and water.Zoe lives together with other young elephants in the protected area.It may take some years, but the final aim is to send all of them to the wild.\nDaphne said that her dream for the future is to see ivory   trade forbidden, all stored ivory destroyed and no one wearing an ivory ornament   ever again.\"There will always be competition for land,\" she explained? \"but we can protect elephants in the parks and give the young a chance.\"",
