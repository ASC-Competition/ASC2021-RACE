  "article": "What looks like an angry old man and lives at the bottom of the ocean? It's the world's ugliest animal---the blobfish .\nIts strange skin is shaped by its habitat. It lives 800 meters below the ocean's surface, a depth where very few other creatures can survive.\nMost fishes have a swim bladder , which is filled with gas and helps them stay afloat. At the depth that the blobfish live, water pressure is 80 times higher than that at higher sea levels and any swim bladder wouldn't be able to serve its purpose.\nThe blobfish don't have a swim bladder because their skin works the same way. It helps them stay afloat without having to use any energy.\nThe blobfish have a pretty relaxed attitude towards eating. All they do is stay and wait for crabs or lobsters to come by.\nSince the blobfish like to eat crabs and lobsters, they often get caught in nets that are used to catch lobsters or crabs and end up dying or being killed. They are not suitable for eating so they are useless for fishermen.\nThere's a purpose behind the blobfish's new title; it has become the new mascot for the Ugly Animal Preservation Society, an organization whose purpose is to preserve endangered ugly animals.\n\"We've needed an ugly face for endangered ugly animals for a long time and I've been amazed by the public reaction,\" said the Society's Simon Watt. \"For too long cute animals have taken the limelight  but now the blobfish will be a voice for those who always get forgotten.\"They hope this new face will help the world know that we need to help preserve the populations of ugly animals too.",
