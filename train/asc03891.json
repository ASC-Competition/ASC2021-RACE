  "article": "Life can be so wonderful, full of adventure and joy. It can also be full of challenges, setbacks and heartbreaks. Whatever our circumstances, we generally still have dreams, hopes and desires--that little something more we want for ourselves and our loved ones. Yet knowing we can have more can also create a problem, because when we go to change the way we do things, up come the old patterns and pitfalls that stopped us from seeking what we wanted in the first place.\nThis tension between what we feel we can have and what we are seemingly able to have is niggling  suffering, the anxiety we feel. This is where we usually think it is easier to just give up. But we are never meant to let go of the part of us that knows we can have more. The intelligence behind that knowing is us--the real us. It's the part that believes in life and its possibilities. If you drop that, you begin to feel a little \"dead\" inside because you are dropping \"you\".\nSo, if we have this capability but somehow life seems to keep us stuck, how do we break these patterns?\nDecide on a new course and make one decision at a time. This is good advice for a new adventure or just getting through today's challenges.\nWhile, deep down, we know we can do it, our mind--or the minds of those close to us--usually say we can't. That isn't a reason to stop, it's just the mind, that little man or woman on your shoulder, trying to talk you out of something again. It has done it many times before. It's all about starting simple and doing it now.\nDecide and act before overthinking. When you do this you may feel a little, or large, _ and you will be on your way.",
