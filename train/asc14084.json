  "article": "Nobody Benefits\nNEW YORK--America has been experiencing the longest economic increase in its history.Incomes have risen, unemployment has fallen, and cities such as New York are bursting with new office buildings.\nBut just a short walk from Manhattan's skyscrapers, George Brown sits on the side-walk, cooking a lunch of rice and bits of fish over a can of cooking fuel.\nBrown is homeless -- one of the 2.3 million people in the US who end up on the street.\nDuring the day, Brown collects aluminium cans and sells them for five cents a piece.At night, he sleeps on the street.\n\"I have been on the street about eight or nine years, something like that,\" said the 62-year-old former construction worker.\nBrown admits he's had problems with alcohol and has smoked cocaine.But he said he still wants a more stable housing arrangement.He could afford it just with the money he earns by collecting cans and small pieces of metal, if only truly low-income housing were available.\nHowever, he sees no hope of finding affordable housing in New York.\nWith the strong economy and unemployment down, beautiful housing is being built to meet demand.\nA US report shows rents in New York city rose more than 27 percent between 1984 and 1999, from US $549 to US $700 a month.\nOne of the side effects of the strong economy is that rents have been going up.\nThe majority of people who experience homelessness really just need some affordable housing help.\nBut few housing companies have been built for the poor.Many small apartments in the city now rent for US $1,500 a month or more.\nBrown, the homeless New Yorker, said he has a daughter who lives in the city but he rarely sees her.She is angry about his drinking and won't allow it in her house.\nSmiling, he said he also has seven grandchildren whom he'd like to see more often.\n\"All I've got to do is clean up my act,\" he said.",
