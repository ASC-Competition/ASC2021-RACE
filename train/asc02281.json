  "article": "There is no doubt that for a long time college education has been accepted. All high school graduates ought to go, says conventional wisdom and statistical evidence, because college will help them earn more money, become \"better\" people, and learn to be more responsible citizens than those who don't go.\nBut college has never been able to work its magic for everyone. And now that close to half our high school graduates are attending, those who don't fit the pattern are becoming more numerous, and more obvious. College graduates are selling shoes and driving taxis; college students interfere(;) with each other's experiments and write false letters of recommendation in the fierce competition so as to get admitted into graduate schools. Others find no stimulation   in their studies, and consequently have to drop out, which is often encouraged by college administrators.\nSome observers say the fault is with the young people themselves--they are spoiled and they are expecting too much. But that's a condemnation  of the students as a whole, and doesn't explain all campus unhappiness. Others blame the state of the world, and they are partly right. We have been told that young people have to go to college because our economy can't absorb an army of untrained eighteen-year-olds. But disappointed graduates are learning that it can no longer absorb an army of trained twenty-two-year-olds,either.",
