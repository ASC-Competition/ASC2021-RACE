  "article": "My aunt Edith was a widow of 50,working as a secretary,when doctors discovered she had got what was then thought to be a very serious heart illness.\nAunt Edith didn't accept defeat easily. She began studying medical reports in library and found an article in a magazine about a well-known heart doctor,Dr.Michael Debakey,of Houston,Texas. He had saved the life of someone with the same illness. The article said Dr Debakey's fees were very high;Aunt Edith couldn't possibly pay them. But could he tell her of someone whose fee she could pay?\nSo Aunt Edith wrote to him. She simply listed her reasons for wanting to live:her three children,who would be on their own in three or four years and among them a little girl who always dreamed of traveling and seeing the world. There wasn't a word of self-pity-only warmth and humor and the joy of living. She mailed the letter,not really expecting an answer.\nA few days later,my doorbell rang. Aunt Edith didn't wait to come in;she stood in the hall and read aloud:\nYour beautiful letter moved me very deeply. If you can come to Houston,there will be no charge for either the hospital or the operation.\nSigned:Michael Debakey\nThat was seven years ago. Since then,Aunt Edith has been around the world. Her three children are happily married. For her age,she is one of the youngest,most alive people I know.",
