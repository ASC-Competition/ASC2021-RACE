  "article": "People usually talk about two groups of colors: warm colors and cool colors. Scientists think that there are also two kinds of people: people who prefer warm colors and people who prefer cool colors. The warm colors are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colors and a lot of lights people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red.\nThe cool colors are green, blue and violet. These colors, unlike warm colors, are relaxing. Where there are cool colors, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one scientist says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colors than in a room with cool colors. He says that a warm color, such as red or orange, is good color for a living room or restaurant. People who are resting or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colors are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly.",
