  "article": "When someone says, \"Well, I guess I'll have to face the music,\" it doesn't mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in by your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you did not do this or that. Terrible music indeed, but it has to be faced. At sometime or another, every one of us has had to \"face the music\", especially as children. We can remember father's angry voice, \"I want to talk to you!\" And only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was!\nThe phrase \"face the music\" is known to every American, old and young. It is at least one hundred years old. Where did the expression come from?\nThe first explanation came from the American novelist, James Fenimore Cooper. He said, in 1851, that expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on the stage. After they got their clue to go on, they often said.  \"It's time to face the music.\" And that was exactly what they did - facing the orchestra  which was just below the stage.\nAn actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly, or perhaps unfriendly, especially if he forgot his lines. But he had to go out. If he did not, there would be no play. So the expression \"face the music\" came to mean \"having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice.\"",
