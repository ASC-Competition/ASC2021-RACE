  "article": "A boy who was cleaning shoes in the street said to a young man passing by, \"Let me clean your shoes.\" The young man said, \"No, thank you.\" \"You may pay me only a pound, sir,\" said the boy. But the young man refused  again. Then the boy told him that he would clean his shoes for nothing. The young man agreed to this, and soon one of his shoes was shining brightly. The man put the other shoe on the boy, but the boy refused to clean it unless  he was paid two pounds for his work. The young man refused to pay anything and went away. But the dirty one looked so bad that he couldn't walk away. He had to turn back and gave the boy two pounds. In a very short time his shoes shone brightly.",
