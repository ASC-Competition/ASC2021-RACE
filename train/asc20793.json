  "article": "These days haze is around us here and there. In fact,everyone has the power to change their living habits to help reduce it. Many local governments call on their people to take action to make the air cleaner.\nTransport is one of the biggest contributors to haze. When,where,how,why and what you drive all affect air quality. When one drives to work for one year,he uses as much energy as a bus rider uses in 10 years. So walk or ride your bicycle to work or school whenever possible. If it is necessary,you can use public transport instead of your car. Each person using public transport for a year instead of a car can save nearly a tonne of pollutants,including CO2,from going into the atmosphere.\nCarpooling is another way to reduce carbon emissions .Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car. It immediately reduces your car's emissions by half.\nWhat you do inside your living space can have a big effect on the air quality outside it. You can do a lot of things inside and around your home that will help you pollute less and save some money.\nA large amount of our energy supply comes from burning coal,another contributor to haze. By cutting down your electricity use,you are cutting down on haze. So you may try to reduce your use of electricity by turning off lights,using your air conditioner wisely during the summer months,or updating some of your electrical appliances to low-energy models. For example,you can use energy-saving lamps that require less energy and last 10 times longer than common bulbs.",
