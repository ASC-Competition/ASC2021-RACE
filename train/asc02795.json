  "article": "Henry was a carpenter of our village. Once I asked him to make a table for my family. A week later, Henry sent us the table and the bill as well.\nMy wife said to me, \"It's a beautiful table, dear, isn't it?\"\n\"I won't decide about that until I see the bill.\" I said.\nHenry was drinking a glass of water. He laughed and gave me a piece of paper. It said,\nBill\nOne dining table                 June 10, 2011\nCost of wood                       17.00\nPaint                               1.50\nWork, 8 hours (1 an hour)             8.00\nTotal                          36.50\nWhen I was looking at the bill, Henry said,\" It's a fine day, isn't it? Quite sunny.\"\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"I'm glad it is only the 10th of June.\"\n\"Me too, \" said Henry.\" You wait. It will be a bit hotter by the end of the month.\"\n\"Yes, hotter and more expensive. The table will be 20 more expensive on June 30th, won't they, Henry? \" I said, \"If it isn't too much trouble, please add it up again. You can forget the date.\"\n\"OK, man. You are such a guy.\" Henry said with a smile in his two blue eyes, and he left with the money he should get.",
