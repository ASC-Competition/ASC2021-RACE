He gives kids some tips  on how to draw and often teaches kids some history about the things they draw. Kids can also learn three or four fun facts about what they are drawing.\n\"Happy Tails\" is about cats and dogs. Mark shows how to draw them and talks about how to look after them, too.\nIn \"A Day With The Dinosaurs\", Mark visits the Museum of Boston and speaks to an expert   to learn how the dinosaurs lived, what they ate and how long they lived.\nIn \"Reach For The Stars\", Mark is also at the Museum of Boston. He speaks to another expert about the stars. I learned how far we are from the stars. I thought that the stars were just about 100 miles   from us, but they are millions of   miles from us. That's really far!\nIf you love drawing, you can watch this show. You can have fun with the tips Mark gives you. The tips will help you to become an artist.",
