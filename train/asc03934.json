  "article": "The TV science-fiction seriesStar Trekno longer looked far-fetched   as four men and four women in black space-suits locked themselves into a giant hi-tech greenhouse, known as a 'biosphere', in the Arizona desert yesterday for a two-year study of the environment.\nAs dawn broke over the Santa Catalina mountains, the eight waved goodbye to television cameras. Edward Ross, their multibillionaire sponsor from a Texas oil family, closed the door of the $150 million structure, with its mini-ocean, marsh, desert, savanna, rain-forest and 3,800 plant and animal species designed to allow the team to recreate Earth and its ecosystems.\nThe so-called Biosphere 2 is the latest of a dozen environmental projects started by the self-titled 'ecopreneur'. The project's main aim is to set up a self-sustaining community for possible use in a spaceship or on another planet. The crew members must plant, harvest and process their food on a half-acre farm in the seven-storey glass and metal structure, while conducting a series of experiments.\n'We will be custodians   of our new little world,' said Abigail Mayer, aged 31, a US marine biologist on the team, her voice choking with emotion. 'It is a brave new step.' Many scientists, however, are more than skeptical. They point out that the largest closed ecosystem which survived more than a few days was smaller than a football. It was developed at the University of Miami and contained only shrimp, algae and other micro-organisms.\nCritics have also accused Mr. Ross of being more interested in producing a profitable theme park than in carrying out serious scientific research. Hundreds of tourists visited the site daily in the summer before it was occupied by the team. They paid $9.95 to enter and all stopped at the souvenir shop.",
