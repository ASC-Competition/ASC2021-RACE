  "article": "If someone says to you, \"give me five\", do not search your pocket for five yuan! It will make others laugh! The person's not asking for your money, but your fingers.\nIn the US, \"give me five\" or \"give me the high five\" is a popular gesture. You can see it often in films or on TV. It means the slapping( ) of each other's raised right hands together.\nPeople do it when they meet for the first time or something happy happens. For example, a student has good marks in exams or wins a lottery . If a football team wins game, the players will give high fives to everyone around to cerebrate.\nThis gesture may come from the old Rome gesture of raising the right arm for the emperor  . This showed that the person raising his arm did not have a sword  in his hand.",
