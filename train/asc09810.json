  "article": "Teenagers with a bedroom television tend to have poorer diet and exercise habits and lower grades in school than those without one, US researchers said on Monday.\n    While many studies have examined TV viewing habits of young people, researchers at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health said little had been known about the effects in particular for older teenagers of having a bedroom TV.\n    They questioned 781 teenagers, aged 15 to 18, in the Minneapolis area in 2003 and 2004. Of them, 62 % reported having a television in their bedroom.\n    Not surprisingly, those with a bedroom TV were more likely to watch it a lot, clocking four to five more hours in front of a television per week, the researchers said. Many more teens with a bedroom TV were classified as heavy TV watchers than those without one.\n    Girls with a bedroom television reported getting less exercise -- 1.8 hours per week compared to 2.5 hours for girls without a TV. They also ate fewer vegetables, drank more sweetened drinks and ate meals with their family less often.\n    Boys with a bedroom TV reported having a lower grade point average than boys without one, as well as eating less fruit and having fewer family meals.\n    \"It is clearly important not to allow your child to have a TV in the bedroom,\" said Daheia Barr-Anderson, one of the researchers.\n    \"When you upgrade your TV in the living room and you have this smaller TV that's out of date but still usable, you should really resist putting it in one of your children's bedrooms,\" she said in a telephone interview.",
