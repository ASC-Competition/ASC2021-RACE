  "article": "What is the relationship between violence and sports? Psychologists say that there are many reasons for violence at sports events. One is alcohol. Many fans drink a lot at games. When people drink, they are more likely to do abnormal things. Psychologist Dennis Brock says, \"Quiet people become loud. Normally nonviolent people become destructive. \"\nDavid Sampson, a sports sociologist, says, \"These are often celebratory riots-- a large number of very happy people mixed in with large amounts of alcohol. They don't often seem dangerous in the beginning, but things get violent quickly. \"\nAnother reason for violence at sports events is the crowd. When individuals are in a large group of people, they can lose their sense of personal responsibility. Edward Hirt, a social Psychologist, says that research shows that people do things in crowds that they would never do alone. People in crowds feel anonymous -- no one knows who they are. Crowds also make people feel powerful. They stop making personal decisions. They just follow the crowd. Social psychologists call this a \"mob mentality.\"\nDave Zarifis, head of public safety says, \"Some people don't even come to celebrate. They want to drink hard and make trouble. Someone does something stupid, and it grows from there. You get a mob mentality. People think it's OK to do almost anything. They think, 'There are so many of us and not enough of them. ' \"\nSocial psychologist Dr. Sharon Kennedy says that there are some things officials can do to prevent violence. Making sure that an area is not overcrowded is very important. Officials should also think of games as \"big parties.\" Then they will prepare differently. Kennedy says that in Great Britain they are controlling the problem with cameras in all the stadiums. \"When you know someone is watching, you are much less likely to behave badly. \"",
