  "article": "Blogs are being used more and more by teachers. Many Internet services now offer free and easy ways to create personal Web pages.\nThrough comments on blogs, or Web logs, teachers can share their classroom experiences. They can exchange ideas and discuss successes and failures. They can debate educational policies. Or they can just sympathize with each other.\nA teacher in the American state of North Carolina recently wrote on her blog: \"Apparently the teachers at my school use too much paper. So my principal yelled at everyone at the last staff meeting for, like, ten minutes. Now, I've just been told, we are not getting anymore paper for the rest of the year.\"\nThis unidentified blogger is now in her third year of teaching, but still calls her sitefirstyearteacher.blogspot.com.\nA blogger who calls himself Minister Lawrence works as a substitute teacher. In April he wrote about a disputed plan to split the Omaha, Nebraska, public schools into separate systems for black, Latino and white students. Supporters say minority parents do not have enough power over their children's education.\nBut Minister Lawrence wrote at teachersparadise.blogspot.com: \"I'm afraid that what this says' to a lot of people is that blacks, whites and Hispanics are not equal, and \"reinforces\" racist beliefs among people.\"\nEducators did not become involved with blogging right away. Many were concerned with privacy issues and security. But now, thousands of teacher blogs can be found on the Internet. Many teachers do not identify themselves, and they change the names of students and co-workers.",
