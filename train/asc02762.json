  "article": "A long time ago there lived a poor slave whose name was Aesop. His face was white, but very homely. When Aesop was about twenty nine years old ,his master lost a great deal of money and was determined to sell his slaves. To do this, he had to take them to a large city where there was a slave market.\nThe city was far away, and the slaves must walk the whole distance. A number of bundles  were made up for them to carry. Some of these bundles contained the things they would need on the road. \"Choose your bundles, boys,\" said the master. \"There is one for each of you.\" Aesop at once chose the largest one. The other slaves laughed and said he was foolish. But he threw it upon his shoulders and seemed well satisfied. The next day, the laugh was the other way. For the bundle which he had chosen had contained the food for the whole party.\n\"Aesop is a wise fellow,\" said his master. \"The man who buys him must pay a high price.\" A very rich man, whose name was Xanthus, wanted a servant. As the slaves stood before him he asked each one to tell what kind of work he could do. All were eager to be bought by Xanthus because they knew he would be a kind master. So each one boosted of his skill in doing some sort of labor. One was a fine gardener; another could take care of horses; a third was a good cook; a fourth could manage a household. \"And what can you do, Aesop?\" asked   Xanthus. \"Nothing,\" he answered. \"Nothing? How is that?\" \"Because, since these other slaves do everything, there is nothing left for me to perform,\" said Aesop.\nThis answer pleased the rich man so well that he bought Aesop at once, and took him to his home on the island of Samos. In Samos the little slave soon became known for his wisdom and courage. He often amused his master and his master's friends by telling funny stories. His master was so much pleased with him that he gave him his freedom.",
