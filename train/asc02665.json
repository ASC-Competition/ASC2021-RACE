  "article": "In the book The Best Little Girl in the World, Kessa has a serious eating disorder   called anorexia nervosa. But she is not alone. Many people have this eating disorder.\nIn the beginning of her story, Kessa is a normal 15-year-old. She is good at many things, especially dancing. She has danced for many years and loves it. One day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right, but maybe lose a few pounds. Once Kessa hears this, she takes things too far. Instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food, she decides not to eat at all. She does not eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. She begins losing weight and becomes slimmer   and slimmer. But she loses weight to a point where she is unhealthy.\nAs her poor eating habits continue, her parents start getting as much help as possible to cure   their beautiful daughter. But it is just as hard for Kessa's parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her. Everyday she exercises to lose more pounds and plans what and when she will eat. Her parents try everything, but Kessa decides not to have any fat on her body.\nKessa's doctor and parents finally take her to the hospital. She is now so thin that she can hardly walk. There, she is given good care.\nIn the rest of the book, Kessa goes through a lot of trouble in order to cure her eating disorder. This book, I think, can help to prevent people from doing this to themselves. It shows the trouble that people go through just to be slimmer, and all the terrible things they must experience to be cured. It is a book I think every teenager should read.",
