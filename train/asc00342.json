  "article": "There are three branches of medicine. One is called \"doctor medicine\" or \"scientific medicine\". Scientific doctors try to observe sickness, look for logical pattern, and then find out how the human body works. From there they figure out what treatments may work. This kind of medicine is believed to date from the 4thcentury BC. Although nowadays it is successful, in the ancient this approach   probably did not cure many patients.\nThe second kind of medicine is called \"natural cures\" or \"folk medicine\", in which less educated people try to cure sickness with various herbs. These folk healers also use observation and logic, but they are not so aware of it. They try things until they find something that seems to work, and then they keep doing that. Folk medicine flourished   long before the development of scientific medicine and was more successful in ancient times.\nThe third kind is called \"health spas\" or \"faith healing\". Sometimes this may be as simple as touching the holy man and being immediately healed. Other times, a magician may make you a magic charm, or say a spell  , to cure you. Some religious groups organize healing shrines   for the sick. In these places people rest, get plenty of sleep, eat healthy food, drink water instead of wine, and exercise in various ways. They also talk to the priests   and pray to the gods. If you are feeling depressed or you have been working too hard, going to these places may be just the right thing to make you feel better.",
