  "article": "Florence,Italy\nWho should go:Art lovers;Renaissance historians;leather handbag shoppers with high credit limits.\nWhen to go:Spring or fall.Travellers usually avoid summer in Florence.\nParis,France\nWho should go:Starving artists;Henry Miler fans;traditional food lovers.\nWhen to go:Spring is the best time.That's what they all say,anyway.Autumn isn't bad,either,and I'd rather be rooting around the south of France in search of truffles  in autumn.Summer in Paris isn't bad,really.\nAmsterdam,Holland\nWho should go:Lovers of Dutch Masters(artists I mean,like Rembrandt,not cigars);bicyclists--it's a bike city in a flat land.\nWhen to go:It can rain at any time in Amsterdam,but that's not a reason for not visiting this fascinating city.Off season tourists will be rewarded with good enough weather to stick around.Summer is good for sun lovers.\nMadrid,Spain\nWho should go: _ --Madrid never sleeps;art lovers--the Prado is second only to the Louvre in presenting serious art;partygoers.\nWhen to go:Spring,when days are warm and the nights are pleasantly cool.Demand for outside eating and drinking starts becoming stronger in March or April.Street life peaks  in June,then slows in July and August as the temperature peaks.Autumn is also good,although you'll risk some rain.\nVenice,Italy\nWho should go:Romantic dreamers who like walking through automobile-free streets;your mother(she'll want you to take her there,trust me);almost anyone who wants to see something really different and romantic.\nWhen to go:February is the time when the famous Venice Carnival is held and the weather is usually cold and foggy--perfect weather for Venice.Summer?A large number of tourists in shorts and whiny children ruin the atmosphere.You'll greatly enjoy yourself there in spring and early fall.",
