Here are some opinions from Ann,Pedro,Crystal and Roy.\nAnn comes from Japan!She likes to have friends who really care about her. She thinks a true friend won't leave her alone when she is in trouble. Besides,she hopes they can teach her English.\nPedro is from Canada. He thinks that friendship means giving. If you want others to care about you,you must care about them first.\nCrystal was born in China. She has the same opinion with Pedro. The real meaning of friendship is giving others something instead of thinking about taking anything back.\nWhat about Roy from Japan? He doesn't care about the looks of his friends. In his opinion,a sincere heart   is more important than looks. If you are in the same country with Roy,you can write emails to him.",
