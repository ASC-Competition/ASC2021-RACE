  "article": "Using a computer or smartphone at night can cause us to pile on the pounds,new research has revealed.\nThe study found a link between blue light exposure(blue light is produced by smartphones and computers)and increased hunger.It found that exposure to blue light increases hunger levels for several hours and even increases hunger levels after eating a meal.Blue light exposure has also already been shown to cause decreased  sleepiness in the evening,increasing the risk of sleeplessness.\nThe leading researcher,Ivy Cheung,from Northwestern University in Chicago,said,\"A single three-hour exposure to blue-enriched light in the evening greatly affected hunger and metabolism .These results are important because they suggest that controlling environmental light exposure for humans may represent a _ approach of influencing food intake patterns and metabolism.\"\nThe study group consisted of 10 healthy adults with regular sleep and eating schedules. They completed a four-day trial under dim light conditions,which involved exposure to less than 20 lux(,)during 16 hours awake and less than 3 lux during eight hours of sleep.On the third day they were exposed to three hours of 260 lux,blue-enriched light starting10.5 hours after waking up.and the effects were compared with dim light exposure.\nIvy Cheung said more research is needed to determine the functions involved in the relationship between light exposure,hunger and metabolism.",
