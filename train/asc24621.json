  "article": "Jackie visited his grandparents on their farm. And he was playing with a slingshot in the woods. He practised in the woods but he could never hit the target. As he was walking back, he saw Grandma's pet duck. Without thinking, he shot, hit the duck in the head, and killed it. He was very afraid. He knew Grandma loved the duck. She would be sad or even angry if she knew that her duck was killed. He then hid the dead duck under a tree. His sister Susan saw it all, but she said nothing.\nAfter lunch that day Grandma said, \"Susan, let's wash the dishes.\" But Susan said,  \"Grandma, Jackie told me he wanted to help in the kitchen today, didn't you, Jackie?\" And then she whispered to him, \"Remember the duck?\" So Jackie did the dishes.\nLater Grandpa asked if the children wanted to go fishing, but Grandma said, \"I'm sorry but I need Susan to help clean the house.\" But Susan smiled and said,  \"Well, that's all right because Jackie told me he wanted to help.\" and she whispered again, \"Remember the duck?\" So Susan went fishing with Grandpa and Jackie stayed.\nThese \"remember the duck\" went on for many days. Then finally Jackie _ it any longer. He came to Grandma and told her that he had killed the duck. She gave him a hug, and said, \"Sweetheart, I know. You see, I was standing at the window and I saw the whole thing. But because I love you, I forgave you. But I just wanted to see how long you would let Susan make a slave   of you. \"",
