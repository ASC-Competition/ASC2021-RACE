She cooks breakfast for us first. And then it's time for cleaning. After that, she has breakfast with father and me. At 9, she goes to buy food for lunch in the supermarket. She can have a short rest after lunch. In the afternoon, mum doesn't go out. She helps me with my lessons. She does some reading, too.\nMother watches TV at about 7 when she finishes   the housework. But at that time she is always tired and falls asleep   in the sofa sometimes.",
