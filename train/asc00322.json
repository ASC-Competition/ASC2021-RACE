  "article": "How clean are the nation's homes?\nAccording to a survey by CIF, there's room for improvement all over Britain.\nLove or hate it -- cleaning your home is one job you simply can't ignore . But that's not to say everyone spends the same amount of time or effort on making their places spotless. A new survey by CIF-- experts on making tough cleaning jobs easier---- shows that when it comes to washing windows or cleaning the oven ,where you live in the UK it may show how much effort you put into the task.\nBATHROOM\n25% of men have never cleaned the toilet -- but those in Wales are the worst. Nearly four in 10 Welsh men said they never cleaned anywhere in the house. Hate cleaning the shower head? You're not alone -- a  quarter of a million Brits say the same. 20% of Scots regard window-cleaning as their most hated job.\nKITCHEN\n36% of people in the south-east say cleaning the cooker is their hated task. 68% of those in the north-east spend more than six hours a week cleaning their homes -- especially the kitchen -- in sharp contrast to the 49% of Welsh and West Country folk, who put their hands up to cleaning for under an hour.\nBEDROOM\n18% believe cleaning starts here: that's the percentage of women who clean wearing their dressing gowns. 51% of women in the north-west may be staying in bed and giving their husband a cuddle --as a thank-you for helping them clean. In other places, there are far fewer helpful men.\nLIVING ROOM\n32% of women in the north-east turn up the stereo to help make the dusting more fun. Almost six in 10 women agree, however, that cleaning is seriously energetic exercise.\nSHIFT THE DIRT WITH CIF\nIt's no secret that the right cleaning products will cut cleaning time and effort in half-- and no one knows that better than How Clean Is Your house? Presenters Aggie Mackenzie and Kim Woodburn. For solutions to all your cleaning needs, here are some of CIF's top tips:\n*Stop a lot of build-up on your shower head--give it a quick squirt with CIF bathroom spray once a week.\n*Stainless steel tools seem to need endless cleaning. The CIF Wild Qrchid Qxy-Gel-it lifts dirt easily and leaves the kitchen smelling fresh and clean.\n*Cooking outside? CIF cream will get your barbecue  spotlessly clean, ready for those long, lazy summer evenings. Perfect!",
