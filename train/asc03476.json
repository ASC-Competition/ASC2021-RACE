  "article": "Uncivilized behavior by passengers unacceptable\nFor the first time, airline passengers have been blacklisted for uncivilized behavior. Their names will remain on the blacklist for one or two years, according to an announcement by the China Air Transport Association on Saturday. The blacklisting means they will not be able to travel by air until their names are removed from the list.\nBlacklisting passengers who disobey the rules for traveling by air and so place their own interests before everything else, including safety, has long been overdue (,).\nThere have been frequent reports of passengers making a scene when their flight was delayed or when they believed that they were not treated as they should be on a flight.\nYet it is natural for some flights to be delayed because of reasons such as bad weather or mechanical problems that need to be solved. However, some passengers seem to take it for granted that their flight must take off at the time stated on their ticket, and they even assume that the members of the cabin crew are simply there to do their bidding .\nThey forget that they should behave themselves in the first place and that respect is reciprocal  .There is no reason for them to be respected when they do not show enough respect for others.\n _ rules can never be over-emphasized when it comes to flight safety. No one has the right to disregard the rules for any reason. Of course, airlines should provide quality services to meet the needs of passengers. Yet, even if passengers are not satisfied with the service provided, there is still no reason for them to flout the rules that are designed for the safety of all.\nThe blacklisting of these three passengers should serve for others to know they have to toe the line  .",
