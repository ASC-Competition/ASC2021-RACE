  "article": "At five he was collecting old newspapers to make money. And when he was 15 he signed his schoolmates up to start a baby-sitting circle.\nNow 20, third-year Cambridge University student, Peter Blackburn is managing director of a company with a PS 30,000 plan. And he thinks it will make more than $15,000 by next summer. He set up Peter Blackburn Ltd last year to bring out a new, color term-planner that now students all over the UK are using.\n\"I felt that most of the planners going around were pretty unimaginative,\" he says, \"I believed that I could do a better job and decided to have a go\".\nBlackburn admits that he is putting far more effort into business than his computer studies course at university. While fellow students are out with their friends, he keeps in touch with his business office in Lancashire by movable phone. Before he set up the company he spent one holiday preparing a plan that would persuade his bank to lend him money.\n\"Most students work hard for a good degree because they believe that will help them get a job to support themselves,\" he says \"I work hard at my company, because that is what will support me next year, after I leave college.\"\nFriends believe that Blackburn will make PS 1 million within 5 years. He is not quite so sure, however. \"There's a lot to be done yet,\" he says.",
