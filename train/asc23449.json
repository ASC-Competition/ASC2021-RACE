It becomes the international language of science, medicine, sports, travel and so on.\nIn most schools in Asia, English is taught as the main foreign language. School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age. English is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States and Australia.\nMany different languages are spoken in some countries. However, English is often used as an official language to help people communicate with each other. India is a good example. English is the common language in this country, but at least twenty-four languages are spoken there.\nDo you know the history of English? Old English took many words from the French language. Most English words came from French, especially those words used for describing the law and the government, such as \"damage\",\" prison \"and \" marriage\". Then, English became what language experts   called Middle English. The history of English continues as Middle English, and then it becomes Modern English, and it is spoken today.\n,.",
