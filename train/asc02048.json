  "article": "\"Hurry, Mommy! Let's go trick-or-treating!\" My daughter waited by the door in her pink princess skirt while I prayed in the living room. Usually I liked taking her out on Halloween, but this year I was sad. I was worried about my mother, who was in China on vacation. I got a call that afternoon that she had slipped and fallen on the hard floor of her hotel and broken her leg. She was taken to a hospital in Beijing. Mom was nervous because she couldn't understand any of the doctors. If only I could do something to help her!\nI knew I couldn't let my worries spoil my daughter's fun. There was nothing I could do for Mom except pray, I thought. We left the house and went down the block. I was so upset that I hardly took notice of the kids around me. There came the man to whose son I'd once given piano lessons. \"Hello there,\" I said, greeting him and the boy at his side.\n\"Hello,\" the father answered. \"Having fun?\"\"I'm trying,\" I said. \"Why, what's wrong?\" he asked. I told him the whole story. \"My mother, in China, broke her leg and didn't understand any of the doctors. And I'm too far away to do anything!\" I said.\nHe raised his eyebrows. \"Beijing, you said?\" he asked. I nodded. He smiled. \"Believe it or not, my sister is a doctor at an English-speaking hospital there. If you want, I'll make a call right away and we'll try and get your mom transferred  .\"\nA few days later I sat in the living room with my daughter as she finished the last of the candy. \"Mommy, how far away is China?\" she asked. \"Not as far as I thought,\" I said.",
