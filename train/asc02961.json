  "article": "China is home to the invention of silk and has a long tradition of producing fine materials for clothing. Not all clothing in ancient or contemporary( ) China is made of silk, however. In fact, silk was only available to the wealthy classes  for much of China's history. Until the introduction of cotton during the Ming Dynasty, from the 14th to the 17th century, the poorer classes wore rough clothing made from fibers  .\nIn ancient China, the tunic was particularly popular . Called hanfu , both men and women could be seen wearing tunics made of different materials. Women's tunics were long and loose , extending all the way down to their feet and often _ with a belt or rope to get tighter . Men's tunics were shorter, usually only extending down to their knees. During the winter, both men and women would wear cotton jackets for warmth. In the winter, men would also wear pants   or ankle-length skirts into their clothes to keep warm and protect their legs against the cold winter conditions.\nContemporary Chinese clothing is now made of many of the same materials as contemporary clothing found in other countries. Much of the traditional Chinese clothing produced now is made of cotton and silk, but generally contemporary Chinese clothing also contains synthetic   fibers in with the cotton and silk, such as nylon  . In addition, linen   is now commonly used in contemporary Chinese clothing, especially during the summer months because it is light and breathable.",
