  "article": "My friend Alice visited my city last week. She arrived on Wednesday morning. She is from Australia. I showed her around the city. We visited the Clock Tower first. The Clock Tower was very tall. We took some photos there. Then we went to City Museum. After that,we saw a good movie. The next day, we visited the Ladies' Street .There were a lot of clothes shops. The clothes were cheap and beautiful. Alice bought some clothes for her parents and friends. Then we went to the Seafood Street. We bought some seafood. We also had seafood in a restaurant. All of us enjoyed the meal. Then we went to a concert in the evening. The music was fantastic!\nOn the third day,the weather was very hot so we decided to visit the Monkey Garden. We found different kinds of monkeys in the Garden. The monkeys were funny and active. Alice went back to Australia on Friday evening. She enjoyed the trip. She invited me to visit Australia next summer.",
