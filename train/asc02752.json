  "article": "A mouse looked through a hole in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package. What food might it contain? He was astonished to discover that it was a mouse trap!\nRunning to the farmyard, the mouse shouted, warning, \"There is a mouse trap in the house; there is a mouse trap in the house.\" The chicken with her head high, said, \"Shut up, Little Ugly. This is a great concern to you, but it has nothing to do with me; I cannot be bothered by it.\"\nThe mouse turned to the pig and told him, \"There is a mouse trap in the house.\" \"I am so very sorry, Mr. Mouse,\" said the pig, \"but there is nothing I can do about it but pray; you are always  in my prayers.\"\nThe mouse turned to the cow, who said, \"A mouse trap; am I in great danger, huh?\"\nSo the mouse had to face the farmer's mouse trap alone.\nThat very night a sound was heard through the house, like the sound of a mouse trap catching its prey. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see that it was a poisonous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital.\nShe returned home with a fever. It is said that drinking fresh chicken soup will help treat fever, so the farmer took his sharp knife to the farmyard for the soup's main ingredient. His wife's sickness continued so that friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer killed the pig.   The farmer's wife did not get well, in fact, she died, and so many people came for her funeral. The farmer had the cow killed to provide meat for all of them to eat.\nSo next time someone is facing a problem, don't say that has nothing to do with you.",
