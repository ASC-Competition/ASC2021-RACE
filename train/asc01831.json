  "article": "It's not often a tomato is described as so sweet 'whenever people see it they just want to hug it'--but this was no ordinary piece of fruit.\nThe heart-shaped tomato was grown by the retired worker, Rod Matless, who said he was surprised when he noticed it in his field. Mr Matless, 69, who had a heart attack a few years ago, was so _ the fruit that he decided to sell it and donate  the money to the British Heart Foundation. The 64g tomato was bought for PS16 on eBay by a woman from Wales--who said she planned to give it to someone special.\nMr Matless, of Wymondham, near Norwich, said: 'I spent a couple of days thinking about what to do with it and I wasn't really sure, but this seems like a good use. I hope it will do someone somewhere a bit of good'. He added: 'It's very sweet--whenever people see it they just want to hug it.' But with the tomato's freshness a key factor , Mr Matless was up against the clock to send it to its new owner before it went bad. He said: 'I didn't want to send someone something horrible . I probably could have raised a bit more money with more time but I was worried about it.'\n'It will certainly make a nice present for a loved one. I hope that they like it and I'm glad I got to help. It's all been very good fun and I've really enjoyed growing this very special tomato.'",
