My house stays clean; my clothes stay put up; the dishes are done.\"\n\"There are no fingerprints on my walls.There are no sounds of arguing, either.So you see, you are very lucky.I would give anything to be going through what you are now! How I'd love to be able to hold my kids, wipe away their tears and share their dreams! I wouldn't care how my house looked.I would be happy just to have them.\"\nNow if you come into my house and see a big mess, you can think bad thoughts if you want, but I feel greatly blessed.(268 words)",
