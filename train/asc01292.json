  "article": "It takes courage to stand up at work.Now more and more people are standing up when they are working on something important.Standing up is in fashion.Medical researchers have found that people who stand at work tend to be much healthier than those who sit.But I wasn't just looking for better health -- standing would also improve how I work and relax my body.\nIn recent years, many office supply companies have begun to sell adjustable desks.These so-called \"sit / stand\" models are equipped with an electric motor that lets them shift from chair height to person height at the push of a button.Unfortunately, sit / stand desks tend to be expensive, hard to find and not very easy to test in person.\nI discovered that when I worked standing up, my mind was clearer and new ideas kept coming to me.I suspect that this is because when you're standing, you feel a bit unchained from your desk.If I got stuck on a word or sentence as I wrote it, I found myself shaking my arms, bouncing   on my feet or stepping away from the desk for a bit -- things I couldn't do in a chair.Often, standing up seemed to relax my mind enough for me to get over creative barriers.\nThere's another thing about standing for a long time: I tend to get hungrier than I do when I sit on a chair.That feels like confirmation  of the stand-up advocates' belief that you burn more calories when you stand than when you sit.For this reason alone, I' m hoping that one day mass-market furniture companies can make many low-priced versions of sit / stand desks.We could all work with a bit more standing up.",
