  "article": "I might be letting my young son watch too much television. I am certainly watching too much many of his programs. They can really be puzzling as they force you to _ .\nFor example, when Franklin (the turtle) wanted a pet, his parents did not want it to be a frog. They felt that frogs belong in a pond. Isn't that where turtles belong? And why is it that Little Bear's animal friends can all talk and behave like people, but his friend Emily has a dog that can only bark and fetch? Tell me that isn't a mystery!\nDog lovers can be reassured (less worried or frightened) by Kipper and his friends. These dogs are very human. However, the only time they wear clothes is when they put on bathing suits to go swimming. I am confused! Speaking of dogs, could Pluto ever be Goofy's pet? I don't get it! What did the great Mr. Disney have in mind?\nAnd this is unfair! The other day we watched a very nice little pig setting up a picnic. One of the foods was a big ham. Could it have been a soybeam ham? Is there such a thing? I hope so! Another thing that really bothers me: what if Elmo(one of my son's favorite cartoon stars) isn't real? He can't be a mere puppet ! He's got a better attitude than most people. I just keep wondering.\nI think we will turn off the TV and go out for a walk. Maybe we will run into that mouse who dresses well but certainly doesn't speak as clearly as the average bear.",
