  "article": "The Appleton Club is the focal point of undergraduate ministry in The Memorial Church. The Appleton Club provides a safe, inclusive, and welcoming space for undergraduates to grow and develop as faithful Christians as they grow and develop as intellectuals and professionals. We focus on building community through worship, study, and service, as well as through social gatherings and outings. All are welcome!\nFor details on all the activities of The Appleton Club, or to be added to our e-mail list, contact _ or 617-496-1426. You can also visit us on Facebook at _ \nOur life together is centered around three weekly gatherings:\nSunday Night Student Service\n9:00 p.m., Appleton Chapel\nEvery Sunday night we gather for a \"come as you are\" worship service that includes the celebration of Holy Communion. The service is designed to provide a peaceful and contemplative space to find peace and encounter the divine at the start of the week. Following the service, we gather downstairs in the Buttrick Room for food and some social time together.\nWednesday Night Discussion Group\n9:00 p.m., Sparks House, 21 Kirkland Street, Cambridge\nThroughout the academic year we will come together during the middle of the week to read and discuss the works of the late Reverend Professor Peter J. Gomes. This spring we will continue discussing his best-selling book The Good Book: Reading the Bible with Mind and Heart as an entry point to conversations about what scripture is, what it isn't, and what it means for our lives as faithful contemporary Christians of the 21st century. Food will be provided.\nFriday Afternoon Social Gatherings\n4:00 p.m., Sparks House, 21 Kirkland Street, Cambridge\nEvery Friday afternoon we gather as a community to check in and wind down from the busy week. This is our time to plan special events, service trips, and retreats, as well as a safe place to ask those burning questions about faith, theology, and scripture that you've always wanted to know about but have been afraid to ask.",
