  "article": "Boys and girls, here I will tell you something about my first trip to the USA.\nWhen I get to Kennedy Airport, I begin my visit to the USA. First, I go to Roy Senior high School. I'm happy on the first night in America because I live with a kind family, the Edwards. It's a big family. They are very friendly to me. They help me do many things. When I want to write to my friends, they buy _ for me; when I lose my camera, they help me buy a new one.\nAfter some days, I go to another school in New Haven. I live in the Palumbos' house. There are three people in the family. I'm surprised that the parents are from two countries.\nIt is a nice trip and I'm happy to be with the two families. They will be my friends for ever .",
