  "article": "The Wizarding World  of Harry Potter theme park will open in Florida in 2009,and will provide attractions and rides based on places from the Harry Potter books.\nThe novels' author JK Rowling has already given her blessing to the project. She said,\"The plans I've seen look unbelievably exciting, and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed.\"\nStuart Craig, the man in charge of the design of the park, is an Oscar-winning production designer who worked on the Harry Potter films so it should be faithful  to JK Rowling's vision.\nStuart Craig said, \"Our primary goal is to make sure this experience is an authentic extension  of Harry Potter's world as it is _ in the books and films.\"\nVisitors to the park will be able to explore some of their favourite places from the book such as the village of Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest and, of course, Hogwarts Castle, where Harry goes to school.\nAlthough fans can look forward to a holiday in the Harry Potter theme park, many will be saddened by the fact that the best-selling series  is now drawing to a close.\nThe final instalment  in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, will be published on 21 July, and to mark the event JK Rowling is to read extracts  from the book to a select audience at midnight on the day of publication.\nRowling has announced that two characters die in the final book, but has not revealed  if Harry is one of them so fans will have to wait to find out the fate of their magical hero.",
