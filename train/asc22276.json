  "article": "\"Where there is a will, there is a way.\" Perhaps not many students can understand this better than 22-year-old Michael Ha. Because of his story of success, he has become an example of young people.\nMichael Ha was born in a very poor family. His parents worked in Vietnam before they moved to Britain in 1980. They couldn't find work in Britain because they spoke little English. The whole family had to live on benefits  and they lived in a small house in Hackney, a poor area in East London. Growing up is not easy for Michael, but he never gave up.\nAt the age of ten, he set his heart on going to Cambridge University. It was not easy, either. Michael studied at a school, which used to be called \"the worst school in Britain\". However, young Michael made his mind to try his best, no matter what kind of school he was studying at. The smart boy studied very hard and did well in every subject at school. Once he made a bet with his friend to learn further math. As a result, after just spending four months teaching himself from a textbook, he got an A in AS-level further math.\nNow Michael is the star medical student in John's College, Cambridge and has just won an award for his excellent grades. He hopes he will be an inspiration for other young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.",
