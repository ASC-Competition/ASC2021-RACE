  "article": "When I was at university,I studied very hard.But a lot of my friends did very little work.Some did just enough to pass exams.Others didn't do quite enough.Fred Baines was one of them.He spent more time drinking in the Students' Union than working in the library.\nOnce at the end of the term,we had to take an important test in chemistry.The test had a hundred questions. In my room the night before the test,Fred was watching TV.Fred usually worried a lot the night before a test.But on that night he looked perfectly calm.Then he told me of his plan.\"It's very simple.There are a hundred questions and I have to get fifty correct to pass the test.I'll take a coin into the examination room.I haven't studied a chemistry book for months,so I'll just toss the coin.That way,I'm sure I'll get half the questions right.\"\nThe next day,Fred came happily into the exam room.As he sat tossing a coin for half an hour he marked down his answers.Then he left,half an hour before the rest of us.\nThe next day,he saw the chemistry professor in the corridor.\"Oh,good,\"he said,\"Have you got the result of the test?\"The professor looked at him and smiled,\"Ah,it's you,Baines.Just a minute.\"Then he reached into his pocket and took out a coin.He threw it into the air,caught it in his hand and looked at it.\n\"I'm terribly sorry,Baines,\"he said,\"You failed!\"",
