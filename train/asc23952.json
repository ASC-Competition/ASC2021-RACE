  "article": "My life plan is to visit all the states in the US. Several years ago, my husband and I were traveling in the northwest. One day, when we were having our breakfast, I lost my wallet that had over $300 in it. There was no way for us to be able to find it, but we went on with our trip.\nWe went off to drive around and enjoy the city, completely forgetting my missing wallet. Later on, when I checked my phone, there was a message from the boss of the restaurant where we had our breakfast:\n\"I have something that belongs to you, and you're going to be very happy.\"\nWe got back to the restaurant and there was the wallet on the table with all the money in it!\nThe boss's son found the wallet in front of the door, and brought it to him. He thought that it must belong to someone who had a meal in the restaurant, so he checked inside and found my phone number on a piece of paper.",
