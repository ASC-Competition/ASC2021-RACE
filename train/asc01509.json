  "article": "BUKHANNON, West Virginia--Two rescue teams slowly moved along a two-mile path on Monday night to the site of a coal mine explosion that trapped 13 miners, who had not been heard from since the early morning accident.\nMeanwhile, at a nearby church, more than 250 family members and friends gathered, waiting for updates on the rescuers' progress.\nThe miners were trapped at about 6:30 and many families weren't informed of the accident until about 10 a.m-more than three hours after it happened.\"It's very upsetting, but you've got to be patient, I guess,\" said John Helms, whose brother, Terry, was trapped in the mine.\nThe trapped miners were about 260 feet underground and about 10,000 feet from the Sago Mine's entrance, said Roger Nicholson, general counsel from International Coal Group.\nAt a late night news conference, Nicholson said one team had advanced about 4, 800 feet in the four hours since entering the mine just before 6 p.m.Another team entered the mine about 30 minutes later.\nHe said the crew was very experienced, with some members having worked underground for 30 to 35 years.The miners were equipped with about one hour of breathable oxygen each.The company has not released the names of the miners.\nThe teams test the air about every 500 feet, and have to disconnect (remove) the power to the phones they use to communicate with the surface before doing that.\" We don't want to be energizing anything if it's in an atmosphere with burnable gases,\" Kips said.\nThe cause of the explosion was not immediately known.High levels of carbon monoxide were discovered shortly after the explosion, which delayed rescue efforts, but those levels have since subsided , authorities said.",
