  "article": "Roger Rolls was the first black governor in the history of New York State, USA. He was born in one of New York's notorious  slums. The children born here rarely did decent work after they grew up. However, Roger Rolls was an exception, for he was not only admitted to the university, but also he became a governor. At his inaugural  press conference, a reporter asked him, \"What made you become the governor?\" Faced with more than 300 journalists, Rolls did not mention his struggle but only spoke of his primary school schoolmaster---Pierre Paul.\nIn 1961, Pierre Paul was engaged as the director and principle of Nobita Primary School. When he entered this school, he found the children here didn't cooperate with the teachers. Pierre thought up many ways to guide them, but none was effective. Later, he found these children were very superstitious , so when he gave lectures, he added a program of palm reading as a means of fortune-telling, with which he encouraged the students.\nWhen Rolls Jumped from the hathpace   and walked to the platform with his small hands stretched out, Pierre Paul said, \"As soon as I see your slender little fingers, I know you will be the governor of New York State in future.\" At that moment, Rolls was shocked because only his grandmother inspired him once, saying that he could become the governor of New York State, so he remembered that remark and believed him.\nFrom that day on, the \"New York State Governor\" was like a banner that constantly inspired him to study energetically and make progress. Rolls no longer stained his clothes with mud, nor did he speak in foul   language. He began to straighten his back when he was walking. In the next more than 40 years, he demanded himself according to the identity of a governor. At the age of 51, he finally became the governor of New York State.\nPut up a banner of faith for yourself and you will have the drive to struggle and the vitality of life.",
