  "article": "A: Recently, the word \"clone\" appeared very often in the newspapers. Do you know its meaning?\nB: Not exactly, I read a report in yesterday's newspaper. It said there was a Scottish Dolly. It was the first time that a cloned lamb had been made from an adult sheep.\nA: Actually, the word \"clone\" means to produce the \"same\" animal by taking cells from an adult one, I think, if we know how to do cloning, we need only keep a small number of sheep, cows or horses.\nB: There's more to it. Recently there have been some people who ever want to clone humans.\nA: It seems interesting. But do you think it is possible to do that?\nB: No, I don't think so. First I think we cannot clone a dead person, because the cells in his body are dead already.\nA: Then we can clone a living person?\nB: Again no! You might clone yourself one after another, but it is only a replica , not real you. It is only something, not a human.\nA: Now, you mean that a real human can speak, think and create, and these abilities cannot be cloned?\nB: True enough! I think the main purpose of Dr. Lan Wilmot, the \"father\" of Dolly, is to make better animals. It has nothing to do with human cloning.\n,.",
