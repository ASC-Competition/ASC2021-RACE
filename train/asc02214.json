  "article": "\"At least you'll be close to home!\"That phrase dominated the weeks before my move to my college.I took comfort in knowing that home was close by if I needed it\nThe night before the move,I spoke with a sophomore friend of mine who was moving back the next morning.I asked if he was sad to be leaving home and his response sparked in me an internal debate.\"It was nice to be back but honestly.
