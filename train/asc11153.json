  "article": "First Man-Bear-Pig, and now global warming; it seems Al Gore never stops to surprise the world. Recently Al Gore produced the movie An Inconvenient Truthwhich explained the threats and told us how to control global warming. What it left out is that there is no proof that human activity is even causing global warming, let alone if global warming is even taking place.\nGlobal warming is the idea that greenhouse gases that shut in infra-red   radiation in the earth' s atmosphere are becoming more powerful and heating our planet up. The theory is that if the planet continues to heat up the polar ice caps could melt and cover the earth in water.\nOver the last 100 years the Earth has increased one degree in temperature, and sea level has risen millimeters. Even though this \"eye-opening\" news is taking place, there is no clear proof saying that it is due to global warming. It could be just a regular weather pattern the earth is circulating. The polar ice caps have not grown or reduced in size since man began tracking them. Also the ground-based temperature has remained the same besides growing cities. In fact most clues support the idea that global warming is not taking place and human activity isn't causing any earth to melt down.\nAlthough Al Gore insists the world is on its way to certain destruction, the facts say otherwise. It seems that driving to work won' t lead to the doom ( ) of mankind, and the movie Water World won' t be happening any time soon.",
