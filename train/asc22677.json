  "article": "Blue Ocean Aquarium is a great place for families to take a holiday. Children love to see the sea animals and watch movies about sharks in it.\nLast Saturday morning, Mr Jackson took his wife and two little sons to the aquarium. At the ticket office, he asked, \"How much shall I pay to get in?\" The woman at the ticket office answered, \"The price is 20 dollars for each adult or any kid older than five. We let kids in free  if they are five or younger. How old are your kids?\" Mr Jackson said, \"The older one is six and the younger one is thee.  I think I must buy three tickets. \" The woman was surprised. She said, \"Sir, don't you want to save 20 dollars? If you tell me your older son is five, I won't know the difference. \"  Mr Jackson said with a smile, \"Yes, that sounds right,\nbut my kids will know the difference. \"\nFrom Mr Jackson' s  story, we know _ is very important in the modem society. We should tell the truth to the people around us, especially to the kids.",
