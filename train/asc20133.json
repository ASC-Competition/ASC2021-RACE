  "article": "China has Mid-Autumn Festival. Canada and the US have Thanksgiving Day. Many countries around the world have harvest festivals. This is the best time for the harvest. Every year in the United States, Thanksgiving Day is on the fourth Thursday of November. But in Canada, people have Thanksgiving Day on the second Monday in October, because Canada is north of the United States, and it is colder, the harvest comes earlier in the year.\nThe harvest brings a lot of food to the people. On Thanksgiving Day, people in Canada and America like to have a big meal with their friends and family--just like Chinese people do at Mid-Autumn Festival. Many Canadians and Americans put flowers, vegetables, and fruits around their homes to say \"Thank you\" for the harvest.",
