  "article": "Allen: I've never been in big fan of the bears, especially the vacation show. On my last trip to Disneyland (1999) we passed it by, because we didn't want to spend the time on something we didn't really enjoy. If we'd known it would be closed by our next visit, I'm sure we would have watched it one more time. I was just making the point that it wasn't until Disney announced the closing that this feeling suddenly sprang  up for the Country Bear Show at Disneyland. But I think the idea of keeping some attractions open forever regardless of the number of visitors it gets is a mistake. We all have great memories of the Bears, but clearly very few kids today (or I should say families today) are making those same memories from this show. That may be a sad fact, but it's a fact. Isn't it right to use the Country Bear space to bring in a more popular attraction so that more kids today can make those magic memories of an attraction they like? Otherwise aren't we just telling kids today that they \"have to\" make great memories of the Bears, when it's obvious that the kids themselves are not enjoying the Bears like we did?\nRoger: I am very disappointed that they have decided to retire the Country Bear Playhouse. I remember going to the show as a child, and still enjoyed it as a teenager, and now young adult. It is true that there aren't a lot of shows left at DL and with this one closing even less. Being at DL does require a lot of walking, and it is nice to have a few attractions that are a place to sit and enjoy a good show. I understand that DL has to develop, but there has to be some history to the Disneyland that Walt Disney first designed. There should be some parts of DL that just never go away, and this is one of them. By the time I have children it looks like there won't be any attractions that I can say I went to as a child at the rate they are going.\nNow the Bears are leaving, What I want to say is: stop trying to compete with everyone! DL is the best, because of attractions like the Country Bears. If DL insists on destroying all of its magic to make way for the latest, well, then it might as well be just another theme park.",
