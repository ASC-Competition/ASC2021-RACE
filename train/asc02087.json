  "article": "\"Little lies\" sometimes come to easily to us that we don't even consider them to be lies. Read about these lies of everyday life:\n1.  Lying about your age or your kid's age to get a cheaper ticket.\n2.  Telling the host of a dinner party that the terrible food he prepared is wonderful.\n3.  Lying to your aunt about how much you love the gift she gave you---the one that you really hate.\n4.  Telling a friend with a terrible haircut that she looks great.\n5.  Lying to a friend about how much you want to see her again when you really don't\n6.Telling the salesperson who calls when you're watching TV that you're very busy.\nAre these serious lies? Probably not, but if you would lie about your age to a stranger, what's going to stop you from lying about something more serious later? If we tell a lie or act dishonestly and get what we want, that might make us feel good today. But what about tomorrow? The future results of our lies are uncertain.\nStill, no one is saying that everyone can or should be completely honest all the time. More people lie, often for a good reason. Lies are told all the time and are part of our everyday social life. Many times people lie to protect the feelings of other people, and there's nothing wrong with that. Honesty is usually the best policy, but like any other policy, you have to make exceptions.",
