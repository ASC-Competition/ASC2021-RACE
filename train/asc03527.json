  "article": "Many people believe that they will be happy once they arrive at some specific goal they set for themselves. However, more often than not, once you arrive \"there\" you will still feel dissatisfied, and move your \"there\" vision to yet another point in the future. By always chasing   after another \"there\", you are never really appreciating what you already have right \"here\". It is important for human beings to keep sober-minded  about the age-old drive to look beyond the place where you now stand. On one hand, your life is developed by your dreams and aspirations  . On the other hand, these drives can pull you farther and farther from your enjoyment of your life right now.\nTo be grateful means you are thankful for what you have right now. Gratitude   fills your heart with the joyful feeling and allows you to fully appreciate everything that arises on your path. As you try hard to keep your focus on the present moment, you can experience the full wonder of \"here\".\nThere are many ways to develop gratitude. Here are just a few suggestions you may wish to try:\n* Imagine what your life would be like if you lost all that you had. This will most surely remind you of how much you do appreciate it.\n* Make a list each day of all that you are grateful for, so that you can stay conscious   daily of your blessings. Do this especially when you are feeling as though you have nothing to feel grateful for. Or spend a few minutes before you go to sleep giving thanks for all that you have.\n* Spend time offering assistance   to those who are less fortunate than you, so that you may gain a new perspective  .\nWhat really matters is that you create a space in your consciousness for appreciation for all that you have right now, so that you may live more happily in your present moment.",
