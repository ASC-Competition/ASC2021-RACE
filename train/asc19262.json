  "article": "Every year there is the Spring Festival in China. Usually it is in January or February. It's the most important festival in   China. So before it comes, everyone has to prepare things. They buy beef, pork, chicken, fruit and many other things. And they often make a special kind of food called \"dumplings\". It means \"come together\" in Chinese. On the day before the festival, parents buy new clothes for their children and children also buy presents for their parents. On the festival eve, all the family members come back to their home. This is a happy moment. They sing, dance and play cards. When they enjoy the meal, they give each other the best wishes for the coming year.\nThey all have a good time.\n,. (5)",
