Here are some ideas on how to keep your valuables   safe while traveling\nPlan ahead of time\nThink of what you really need and don't need to take on your trip. Only take the valuables that you must have, not just ones that you would like to have.\nCarry your valuables on your person\nSomething that is small, like cash and credit cards and your passport, can be carried in a money wallet around your neck or in a money belt. This way, your valuables are hidden and right next to you, where you know where they are at all times. Wear clothing that can hide the money belt.\nCarry larger valuables in your carry-on bag.\nIf you can't fit it in your money wallet like some large valuables, you'd better put them somewhere that you will keep touch with them. Your can put them on the plane, so you don't have to worry about  the airline losing your bag or someone stealing it from the belt after the flight before you get to it.\nChoose a hotel that has the front desk for valuables.\nThis way, you don't have to worry about housekeeping getting hold of your valuables, or someone  stealing your valuables if your room is broken into. If you give the valuables to the front desk to keep for you, choose a time when others are not looking.",
