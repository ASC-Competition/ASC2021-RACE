You only need sports shoes and then go for a walk in a store or a park with two or more people at a time.\nDavid Sabgir is a doctor in the U.S.A. He starts the new health program. Every Saturday morning, Sabgir runs in a park and he starts thinking, \"I run to help myself to be healthy. But I think I can help more people to be healthy.\"\nSo he tells his friends and other   people about this. They all like the idea. For the first walk, 101 people join. Later  , more and more people join this health program.",
