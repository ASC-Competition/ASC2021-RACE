  "article": "I was in the park with my elder sister, Cathy, on Friday. My sister left her jacket on a chair while we talked to some friends. When we went back to the chair, a girl in a red T-shirt was sitting there. She had some money in her hand. When she saw us, she stood up and walked away.\nI asked my sister, \"Did you have any money in your jacket?\"\nShe said, \"Yes, Anna, I did.\"\nI said, \"Look in your jacket quickly.\"\nCathy looked in her jacket, but her money was not there.\n\"That girl stole it!\" I said, and we both ran after her. We caught her quickly.\nMy sister was very angry and she said, \"Give me the money.\" The girl gave the money to Cathy and ran away. We both ran after her, but we lost her.\nThen we went home. But before we could tell our parents, my mother said to Cathy, \"You left your money at home. It's on the table in the sitting room. You must be more careful with money.\"\nSo the girl in the red T-shirt was not a thief! She probably thought we were thieves! We felt terrible.\nPlease telephone us if you know this girl! We are very sorry for our mistake. We would like to say sorry to her and give the money back to her.\nOur number is 512667. My name is Anna.",
