  "article": "One year ago Bertha and Grace became close friends at a college in Dartmouth.\nOne day, Bertha said that her aunt Margaret had invited  her to spend the summer holiday with her. And they would have picnics and parties as well. But Grace told Bertha that she planned to stay in Clarkman's bookstore until the new term began.\nGrace had to do something to feed herself because her parents died many years ago. Bertha  watched her friend's  pale   face. Just then she got a good idea. The next day when  Grace came back, Bertha showed her an invitation letter from her aunt Margaret.\n\"Grace, would you like to spend your holiday with us? I will help you find a part-time job in our town.\" Grace cried after reading it.\n\"Grace, please spend the holiday with me, or Margaret will be disappointed  . I want you to be happy,\" Bertha said.\nThe holiday quickly passed by, and finally one letter from Margaret came to Bertha.\n\"Bertha, Grace is the sweetest girl in the world, and I am very grateful  to you for sending her here.\"",
