  "article": "Mr. Read has a large farm near a hill. He and his wife are busy all the day. They're often tired but they have a lot of expensive things and they live a happy life.\nOne day their sows  had twenty baby pigs. Mrs. Read had to look after them at home. And at that time she had much housework to do. Several weeks later she let the baby pigs come out of the pigsty  and look for some food themselves. Her seven-year-old son John came back from school.  He was ready to help his mother. The woman was happy and told him to count  them and see if  they were all there. The boy threw his schoolbag on the table and ran out. About half an hour later the supper was ready, but the boy didn't come back. The woman had to go to see what was wrong with her son. and she saw her son running after a baby pig. \"What are you running after it for?\" she asked. \"Are they all right?\" \"I counted nineteen, mummy, \" said the boy.  \"But only the fellow   is running about so fast that I can't count it all ! \"",
