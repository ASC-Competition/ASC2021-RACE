  "article": "If you dream in color, you're not alone: the majority of people today claim to have colorful dreams. But it wasn't always thus. Research conducted in the early part of the last century consistently found that people reported dreaming most often in black and white.\nAccording to Eva Murzyn at the University of Dundee, there are at least two possible explanations for this strange situation.\nThe first is the methods used in the researches. The early studies tended to use questionnaires , while more modern studies use dream diaries (filled in upon rising in the morning) or so-called \"REM-awakening\", which involves interrupting people's dream-filled periods of sleep to find out what they were dreaming about. People's memories of their dreams are likely to be less accurate by using the questionnaire approach and they are more likely to reflect their beliefs about the form dreams generally take in an unclear way.\nThe second explanation has to do with black and white television and film. It's possible that the sudden increase in black and white film and television during the first half of the last century either affected the form of people's dreams at that time, or affected their beliefs about the form dreams generally take.\nAccording to Murzyn's findings, it's the explanation based on media exposure that _ . She used both questionnaire and diary methods to study the dreams of 30 older (average age 64) and 30 younger people (average age 21).\nThe methodological technique made no difference to the type of dreams people reported. However, the extremely important thing was that, across both questionnaires and diaries, the older participants (who had had significant early life exposure to black and white media) reported experiencing significantly more black and white dreams over the last ten days than the younger participants (22 per cent vs. 4 per cent).\nAnother finding was that older participants reported black and white dreams and colorful dreams to be of equal clearness. By contrast, the younger participants reported that the quality of black and white dreams was poorer. This raises the possibility that the younger participants didn't really have any black and white dreams at all, but were simply regarding poorly remembered dreams as black and white.",
