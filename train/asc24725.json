  "article": "BASEBALL. It's just a word, but for millions of Americans it brings much more than a word.\nHot dogs. Cold beers. Sunny afternoons. Baseball is the game of fathers and sons. Fathers and sons catch with each other on lawns   in the US. A father's favorite team becomes his son's. Grandfathers talk to their grandsons about games played long ago.\nMany American kids collect baseball cards. The cards have pictures of their favorite players on them. In school, friends trade   baseball cards just like they trade their lunches.\nPlayers are known as \"the boys of summer\" because people often play the sport mostly in warm months. You don't need to be of a certain size or shape to play baseball. You don't have to be tall like a basketball player or strong like an American footballer. You just need to want to have fun.\nBaseball is not as fast-paced   a game as basketball. But when you go to see a game, there's time to relax, talk and get to know other people.\nBaseball may not be the most popular sport in the US, but it is the most traditional. It's not just a game any more, but an important part of American culture, like apple pie and grandma's house.",
