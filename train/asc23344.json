  "article": "Since two years ago, Where Are We Going, Dad? ( <<?>> ) has become one of the most popular TV shows. On the shows, the five fathers and their children traveled around China, riding camels through the western deserts, fishing on the east coast, and selling vegetables for their bus fare  home in southwestern Yunnan Province.\nOne dad doesn't know how to do his daughter's hair, so some people try to help him. Another one must _ with his son for three days in the desert. Because the father can't cook, they only eat instant noodles .\nWhy is Where Are We Going, Dad? so popular? Because it is about how Chinese parents look after their kids. The show makes modern parents think about what they should do with their kids. \"In traditional Chinese culture, the father is strict and the mother is kind. But on the show, we see fathers who are much gentler  on their kids and more involved  in their upbringing \" said Li Minyi, a professor of early childhood education.\nIn the past, children were taught to obey their parents' wishes and look after them in their old age. But today Chinese parents increasingly realize that respecting their children's choices may be a better way to prepare them for modern society. As they raise their children, parents are growing up at the same time.\n,.",
