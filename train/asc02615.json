  "article": "One of the odd things about some business organizations is that they spend so much money attracting new customers but spend so little keeping them. It just doesn't make sense. However, taking customers for granted is a routine in some business organizations.\nLoyal customers are an organization's only protection against bankruptcy , and losing them because of neglect or indifference is really wrong. Not only do satisfied customers continue to buy by themselves, but they often encourage others to buy. This is advertising that doesn't cost a penny. Although there are always problems in giving good service to customers, maintaining their business isn't all that difficult. It's a matter of attitude, of believing that everyone who buys from you is entitled to the best treatment you can deliver. Plus giving just a little more than you have to.\nThere are always problems in giving good service to customers. The reason, of course, is that no organization is perfect, and there's many a slip: unreasonable delays in filling orders, shipping the wrong goods, failing to answer letters promptly, and so on. Sometimes these errors or failures can't be helped. For example, if you can't get parts because of material shortages or a transportation strike, customers may be denied the goods they've ordered.\nNo matter who is at fault, customers whom you value highly should generally be given the benefit of the doubt. The old saying that _ . Customers who repeatedly place large orders and pay for them will naturally, get more attention than those who buy infrequently and have to be badgered to pay what they owe. However, you have to make the assumption that all customers are good unless proved otherwise.",
