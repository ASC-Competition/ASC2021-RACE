  "article": "James Joyce was an Irish novelist who revolutionized the methods of depicting characters and developing a plot in modern fiction. his astonishing way of constructing a novel, his frank portrayal(, )of human nature in his books, and his complete command of English have made him one of the outstanding influences on literature in the 20th century. Many critics judge that _ in his mastery of the English language. Joyce was deeply influenced by Ireland and wrote all his books about Dublin.\nWhen he was in Dublin College, he studied languages and spent his spare time reading books. He refused to take part in the nationalist movement like his fellow students, but he became passionately(, )interested in literature. He wrote outspoken articles of literary criticism that shocked his teachers and even taught himself norwegian so that he could read Ibsen's works in the original.\nWhen he graduated in 1902, he knew he would become a writer and an exile(, ), because he felt he could not be one without the other. In order to preserve his ideal of writing truthfully, fully, and as objectively as he knew how, about the people and places he knew best, he had to escape from all temptations to become involved in popular opinion or public life. He went to France, Italy and Switzerland, where he lived in poverty and obscurity for the first 20 years, only returning to Ireland when his mother was dying. Except for a couple of brief trips, he stayed abroad all his life.",
