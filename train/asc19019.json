  "article": "At one time or another we have all stopped to think about the weather. Some days the weather is good. Some days the weather is bad. Sometimes a day that seems bad turns out better than you thought it would. There are ways of understanding the weather. One way is to study the clouds. No two clouds are ever alike. We can see the different kinds of clouds and watch them for signs of changing weather. To forecast the weather, there are three things about clouds. you should look for: movement, colour, and change. As a rule, the higher the clouds, the better the weather. And the lower the clouds, the worse the weather is likely to be. Fair-weather cumulus clouds* are another sign of good weather. These are clouds we often see on warm summer days. Clouds can tell you if a storm is on the way. If the thick, fluffy cumulus clouds get bigger early in the day, then you know it will rain. If there is a sudden, cool and dark thunder* cloud appears, then a storm is about to break out. Colours in the sky tell us about the weather, too. A golden ring around the moon warns us that a storm is on the way. A watery yellow sunset is a sign that rain may be near. The rainbow* has a message, too. The colours of the rainbow come from the sun rays shining through falling rain. If you see the sun in the east and a rainbow in the west, the rain may be coming your way. If the sun is in the west and the rainbow is in the east, the rain will be moving away from you.",
