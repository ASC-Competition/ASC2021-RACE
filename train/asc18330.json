  "article": "One windy spring day, I observed young people having fun using the wind to fly their kites. Multicolored creations of varying shapes and sizes filled the skies like beautiful birds dashing and dancing in the exciting atmosphere above the earth. As the strong winds gusted against the kites, a string kept them in check.\nInstead of blowing away with the wind, they arose against it to achieve great heights. They shook and pulled, but the controlling string and the clumsy tail kept them in tow , facing upward and against the wind. As the kites struggled and trembled against the string, they seemed to say, \"Let me go! Let me go! I want to be free!\" They flew beautifully even as they fought the forced restriction of the string. Finally, one of the kites succeeded in breaking loose. \"Free at last,\" it seemed to say. \"Free to fly with the wind.\"\nYet freedom from control simply put it at the mercy of an unsympathetic gentle wind. It flew ungracefully to the ground and landed in a twisted mass of weeds and string against a dead bush. \"Free at last\". Free to lie powerless in the dirt, to be blown helplessly along the ground, and to settle down lifeless against the first roadblock.\nHow much like kites we sometimes are. There always exist misfortunes and restrictions, rules to follow from which we can grow and gain strength. Prohibition is a necessary counterpart to the winds of opposition. Some of us pulled at the rules so hard that we never fly fast to reach the heights we might have obtained. If we keep all the commandment , we will never rise high enough to get our tails off the ground.\nLet us each rise to the great heights, recognizing that some of the prohibitions are actually the steady force that helps us climb and achieve.",
