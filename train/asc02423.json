  "article": "Below are the best four applications(,app) to help you organize your closet--and trust us, there really is something for everyone.\nCloset\nIf you're looking to create your own digital closet, then this app is for you. Closet helps you categorize your outfits and keeps you uptodate on what you've already worn.\nPROS : Very simple and userfriendly. Great for helping you look at your own closet without feeling overwhelmed.\nCONS : No social interactions.\nPose\nThe app makes things insanely easy for the indecisive shopper. So if you're debating whether or not to buy something, you can get a second opinion. The app also gathers photos of items that you wish to buy and items you already own, so they are all in one spot.\nPROS: When you sign up, you fill out a short survey that helps identify your personal style and subsequently finds people with similar taste that you can follow for inspiration.\nCONS: The phone application is more visually appealing than the actual website.\nStylitics\nIt allows you to categorize your clothes by color, brand, pattern and more. And if you're wondering whether you have already worn an outfit, simply check your style calendar.\nPROS: The app comes with a \"Today in Fashion History\" tip so you can brush up on your style knowledge.\nCONS: You can't view your style profile using the app yet unless you log on to the site.\nWalk in My Closet\nIf you're browsing the Internet, looking for something to buy, you can instantly add the item to your virtual  closet so that your wish list items are all in one place. Besides sharing your closet with other users, you can also sell items you no longer want.\nPROS: The \"Moodboard\" is a great way to gather inspiring looks that you like from other users and fashion experts.\nCONS: The luggage feature, which allows you to prepare outfits for an upcoming trip, is only available on the site; it would be useful if it were on the app.",
