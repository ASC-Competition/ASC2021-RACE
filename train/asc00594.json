  "article": "If you exhibit positive characteristics such as honesty and helpfulness, the chances are that you will be thought as a good-looking person, for a new study has found that the perception   of physical attractiveness is influenced by a person's personality.\nThe study, which was led by Gary W.Lewandowski, has found that people who exhibit negative characteristics, such as unfairness and rudeness, appear to be less physically attractive to observers.In the study, the participants viewed photographs of opposite-sex individuals and rated them for attractiveness before and after being provided with information about their personalities.\nAfter personality information was received, participants also rated the probability of each individual' s becoming a friend and a dating partner.Information on personality was found to significantly change the probability, showing that cognitive   processes modify   judgments of attractiveness.\n\"Thinking a person as having a desirable personality makes the person more suitable in general as a close relationship partner of any kind,\" said Lewandowski.\nThe findings show that a positive personality leads to greater expectation of becoming friends, which leads to greater expectation of becoming romantic partners and, finally, to being viewed as more physically attractive.The findings remained consistent regardless of how \"attractive\" the individual was formerly thought to be or of the participants' current relationship status.\n\"This research provides a positive outcome by reminding people that personality goes a long way toward determining your attractiveness; it can even change people's impressions of how good-looking you are,\" said Lewandowski.",
