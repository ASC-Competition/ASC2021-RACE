Some people make costumes at home. Some people buy them in shops. People also make decorations for the festival. These decorations look like witches, black cats, ghosts, skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Jack-o- lanterns are pumpkins that are cut to look like faces.\nPeople think that Halloween is the children's New Year's Eve. On that day children dress up in special costumes and masks. They eat too much, and go to bed very late after celebrating. They go from one door to another saying \"trick or treat\". People give them candies,cookies,fruit or money.\nAdults and older children also celebrate Halloween with parades  ,festivals and costumes parties. One kind of the parties welcomed by children is dunking for apples. Apples are put in tubs  full of water. People try to get the apples using only their mouths; they cannot use their hands.",
