At their highest, the cliffs soar an impressive 702 feet above the Atlantic Ocean, offering the million visitors who visit each year incredible views sure to leave hearts racing both from the beauty and the height.\n*  White Cliffs of Dover,UK\nThese famous cliffs along England's south-eastern coast are as rich in history as they are in beauty. They stand tall along the Strait of Dover, separating England from France and continental Europe. During World War I, the first bomb to hit the UK fell in Dover, and it served as a prominent location during WWII as well. And nowadays, the city is the best known for the beauty of its chalky white cliffs.\n* Mount Thor, Canada\nThe name Mount Thor may inspire fear or respect -- as well it should, considering this is the steepest, tallest cliff in the world. Thor reaches an astonishing 4?101 feet above sea level, and the utter greatness of its vertical incline kept it from being successfully gone up until 1965. Today,it remains a challenging and popular place for rock climbers. '\n* Cliffs of Etretat,France\nLocated along France's Alabaster Coast, these cliffs offer more than just steep walls. Climb to the top and you'll have views of arched rock formations, as well as scenery that inspired the famous painter Claude Monet. At various points along the cliffs580-mile stretch, you can spot natural sculptures that are said to resemble an elephant, among other things.",
