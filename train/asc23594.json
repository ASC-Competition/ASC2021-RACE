  "article": "Do you like traveling? Have you traveled to Los Angeles? Have you traveled to the moon? A rich man plans to live on Mars. Is it the beginning of a science fiction novel? In fact, it happens in the real world. Elon Musk is the founder and CEO of a private spaceflight  company. He has said his plan is to live on the planet. He says he plans to live on Mars with a group of fewer than ten people. He will take them on a rocket powered  by liquid oxygen  and methane . Each one should pay $ 500,000 to fly there.\nHowever, these passengers are not going there to travel, but they are going to work. They need to carry tools to build houses and grow crops  there.\nMusk believes one person out of every 100,000 people may be interested in making the journey. Then Mars will have sixty-three thousand people in the future.",
