  "article": "Ever wondered how one person could save the planet from the effects of climate change?\nA British-made computer game on trial release on Monday creates different ways of doing just that.\n\"Fate of the World\"puts the Earth's future in players' hands, placing them in charge of an international environmental body which could save the world from the effects of rising greenhouse gas emissions or let it destroyed by more emissions.\nThrough different scenes, players can explore options such as geoengineering  and alternative energy sources to save the planet from rising temperatures, decreasing natural resources and a growing population over the next 200 years.\nAn improved version of the game will be followed by a three-month feedback period from players, with final release due in February next year.\nCreated by Oxford-based games developer Red Redemption, the game is different from other mainstream action games mainly by using data from real climate models and advice from scientists and economists.\n\"Science data is often inaccessible and we are trying to put players in a position of power and connected with the issues,\" Gobion Rowlands, Red Redemption's founder and chairman said.\nThis year, a series of apparent errors in climate science and the failure of UN talks to reach an international deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions appeared to weaken the public's interest in climate change.\nHowever, games centered on sustainability and human rights have been growing in popularity and are welcomed by green groups as a way of raising awareness.\nUsing climate change as inspiration for entertainment shows the issue has affected global culture, which can only be a good thing.Friends of the Earth's head of climate Mike Childs said.\"We need creative industries to work with these big issues as the results can be extremely powerful and can help us to understand what a sustainable future looks and feels like,\"he added.",
