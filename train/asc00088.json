  "article": "The new world of today introduced new threats that were not known in the previous generations: Internet predators . Often we do a lot of our researching, shopping, talking; just about everything online nowadays. New advancements in revolution comes along with the unwanted attackers. There are people out there who gain pleasure from, interrupting and taking from our peaceful lives what's not rightfully theirs. But like with everything, there are indeed counteractive measures that can be set in place to fend off these predators from such damage. I'd like to introduce the Guardian Eye.\nWithin this program is a complex program which has several functions to create a safe atmosphere for whomever uses the computer, It has the ability to track and log every key stroke, every website that has ever been accessed, takes screenshots of web pages, blocks web pages according to content and even sends you messages via email once conspicuous  activity has been reported and logged. Just think, you or child could be browsing and searching through the Internet and inappropriate content pops up with several different windows. You try to click out of the windows but you accidentally click one which releases spyware, infecting your computer. Guardian Eye blocks unwanted content from popping up or appearing to the users, which I thought was extremely convenient. In this way there is not even the slightest temptation.\nThis product helps prevent damage from being done to your computer and worse, your identity. It's quite the product and it offers a little version so you may try it out first. If you'd like the full package, it's a once time fee 39.99 and can be installed on unlimited computers for your convenience. It's a nice deal and I'm considering getting it again considering I do a lot of writing on various websites myself.",
