  "article": "A woman baked bread for members of her family and an extra one for a hungry passer-by. She kept the extra bread on the window-sill  , for whomever would take it away.\nEvery day, a hunch-back   came and took away the bread. Instead of expressing thanks, he said the following words as he went his way: \"The evil   you do remains with you. The good you do, comes back to you!\"\nThis went on, day after day. Every day, the hunch-back came, picked up the bread and repeated the words. One day, the woman felt angry and decided to do away with him. She added poison   to the bread she prepared for him !As she was about to place it on the window sill, her hands trembled. \"What is this I am doing?\" she thought...As usual, the hunch-back came, picked up the bread and repeated those words.\nThat evening, there was a knock on the door. As usual, the hunch-back came, picked up the bread and repeated those words.\nThat evening, there was a knock on the door. As she opened it, she was surprised to find her son standing in the doorway. His clothes were torn. He was hungry, starved and weak. As he saw his mother, he said, \"Mom ,it's a wonder I'm here. While I was but a mile away, I was so hungry that I fell down. I would have died, but just then an old hunch-back passed by. I begged of him for a small part of his food, and he was kind enough to give me a whole bread.\nAs the mother heard those words, her face turned pale and red. She remembered the poisoned bread that she had made that morning. Had she not burnt it in the fire, it would have been eaten by her own son, and he would have lost his life!\nIt was then that she realized the significance of the words: \"The evil you do remains with you. The good you do,comes back to you!\"",
