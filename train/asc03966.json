  "article": "We are surrounded by mixed messages about mistakes: we're told we earn by making them,\nbut we work hard to avoid them. So the result is that most of us know that we are going to make\nmistakes, but deep down, we feel we shouldn't.\nExperiments with schoolchildren who did well on a given test show that those who were\npraised for being smart and then offered a more challenging or less challenging task afterward\nusually chose the easier one. On the other hand, children praised for trying hard-rather than\nbeing smart-far more often selected the more difficult task.\nIf we try hard to avoid mistakes, we aren't open to getting the information we need in\norder to do better. In a writing study, experiments showed that those who are so scared to\nmake mistakes perform worse in writing tasks than those who aren't as worried about being\nperfect. They fear receiving any kind of negative feedback, so they don't learn where they went\nwrong and how to get better.\nWe don't just learn more when we're open to mistakes, we learn deeper. Research tells us\nthat if we're only concerned about getting the right answer, we don't always learn the\nunderlying concepts that help us truly understand whatever we're trying to figure out. Mistakes\nneed to be seen not as a failure to learn, but as a guide to what still needs to be learned. As\nThomas Edison said, \"I am not discouraged, because every abandoned wrong attempt is\nanother step forward. \"\nFurthermore, we often make mistakes because we try new things-we wander away from\naccepted paths. Teflon, penicillin-these are examples of great discoveries made by mistake.\nTake a page from Albert Einstein, who said, \"Anyone who has never made a mistake has never\ntried anything new. \"",
