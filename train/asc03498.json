  "article": "British paychologists have found evidence of a link between excessive  Internet use and depression, a research has shown.\nLeeds University researchers, writing in the Psychopathology journal, said a small part of Internet users were classed as Internet addicts and that people in this group were more likely to be depressed than non-addicted users.\nThe article on the relationship between excessive Internet use and depression is from a questionnaire-based study of 1,319 young people and adults.\nThe respondents answered questions about how much time they spent on the Internet and what they used it for; they also complete the Beck Depression Inventory---a series of questions designed to measure the seriousness of depression.\nThe six--page report, by the university's Institute of Psychological Science, said 18 of the people who complete the questionnaire were Internet addict.\"Our research indicates that excessive Internet use is associated with depression, but what we don't know is which comes first--are depressed people drawn to the Internet or does the Internet cause depression?\" the article's lead author Dr Catriona Morrison said.\"What is clear is that, for a small part of people, excessive use of the Internet could be warning signal for depressive tendencies.\"\nThe age range of all respondents was between 16 and 51 years, with an average age of 21.24. The average age of the 18 Internet addicts was 18.3 years. By comparing the levels of depression within this group to that within a group of 18 non--addicted Internet users, researchers found the Internet addicts had a higher chance of developing depression than non-addicts. They also discovered that addicts spent more time visiting sexually pleasing website, online gaming sites and online communities.\n\"The public speculation was further proved by this study. That's to say, over-engaging in websites which serve to replace normal social function might be linked to psychological disorders like depression and addiction,\" Morrison said.\"We now need to consider the wider social influence of this relationship and clearly prove the effects of excessive Internet use on mental health.\"",
