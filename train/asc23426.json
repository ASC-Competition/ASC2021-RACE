  "article": "Let me tell you my pen friend Ivan. He is 12 years old. He likes playing football. He usually plays football with his friends at weekends.\nIvan lives with his father and mother in a city in France. They have a home with five rooms, a swimming pool and a garden. They often have a party in the garden at weekends. They like to help their neighbours. His home is not near his school, so Ivan takes a bus for an hour and then walks for 10 minutes to school. There is a Basketball Club near his school. He likes playing basketball in the club.\nIvan's father is a worker. He is busy. Ivan's mother is a doctor. She is nice to the patients. Ivan wants to be a teacher when he grows up. I want to be a teacher, too. Every month Ivan writes two letters to me. He'll come to China next year. We'll meet then.",
