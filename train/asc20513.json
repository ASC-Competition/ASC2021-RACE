  "article": "Last weekend, our family went to have Christmas dinner in a restaurant. We were the only family with a baby in the restaurant. Suddenly, my baby Erik became excited when we were enjoying our meal. I looked around and saw an old man with old clothes and dirty old shoes. His hair was unwashed. He was smiling at my Erik.\n\"He might hurt my Erik,\" I thought. Everyone in the restaurant looked at us and the old man. Then we decided to leave. The old man sat between the door and us.\nAs I walked closer to the man, I turned my back. Suddenly, Erik leaned  over my arms, reaching with both arms in a baby's pick-me-up position . Before I could stop him, Erik had escaped  from my arms to the man's. Soon the very old smelly man and my young baby developed a kind of friendship.\nErik put his little hand on the man's face, and I saw the old man closed his eyes and tears running down his face. His aged hands held my baby so gently . A moment later, the old man opened his eyes, passed me my baby and said, \"Thank you, Madam. You've given me the best Christmas gift.\"\nI cried, with my face burning hot. A child saw a soul , but a mother saw only a kind of clothes.",
