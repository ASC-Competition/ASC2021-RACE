The long-distance bus routes near Dongzhimen station pass through Shunyi, Pinggu and other outskirts.\n Park and ride\nPark and ride facilities allow commuters to leave their personal vehicles in a parking lot and transfer to a bus or rail system.\nIn Beijing, because of city planning and other factors, park and ride is limited to bus and subway stations beyond the Fourth Ring Road. Since the Line 5 subway began operating, a low-fare parking lot, the largest in Beijing, was created at Tiantongyuan Beizhan station. Drivers are encouraged to spend just two yuan per day parking their vehicles and take the subway into the city.",
