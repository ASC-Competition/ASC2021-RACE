  "article": "If your parents were to surprise you with a present on your birthday, which one would you prefer, a trip to the amusement park or a new pair of shoes?\nAccording to Science Daily, about onethird of the people are likely to prefer shoes to a fun trip. These people are called \"materialists\", namely, those who value material goods more than experiences. But which of the two choices makes people happier?\nBack in 2009, Ryan Howell, a professor at San Francisco State University, found that in the long run, experiences make people happier than possessions. This is because the joy of receiving a new object fades over time as you get used to seeing it every day. Experiences, on the other hand, can continue to bring you joy in the future through happy memories.\nBut materialists should at least be happy when they first buy something, shouldn't they?\nTo figure it out, Howell did another study. He classified a group of adults according to their personality types, ranging from less materialistic to more materialistic. Each person was asked different questions to see how they felt about spending money on material goods versus spending money on experiences.\nAs expected, the more materialistic participants got less happiness from purchases than the less materialistic, because such purchases didn't fit with their personalities and values. But to Howell's surprise, he found that materialists weren't any happier even if they spent money on material items.\nThis is because materialists worry that others may criticize or look down on their choices. \"There are certain value systems that are rejected by society,\" said Howell. \"When we find out someone is materialistic, we think less of them, and that drives their happiness down.\"\nAnother reason is that materialistic people always focus on what they don't have instead of what they have now. This makes them feel less satisfied and grateful.\nIf you happen to be a materialistic person, there's something you can try. \"If materialists make more accurate purchases, rather than trying to impress others, they will be happier,\" Howell said.\nYou should also remember what an ancient Greek philosopher once said, \"Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for.\"",
