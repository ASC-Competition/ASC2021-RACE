  "article": "London will host a major exhibition  of 15th-century Chinese artwork, including paintings, sculptures  and porcelain, which are all from Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).\nThe exhibition will be open from Sept 18 to Jan 5. On display will be 108 cultural relics from 10 museums in China, as well as collections from the British Museum and museums in Japan, the United States and Europe. The exhibition will be in five parts to give an overview of the society.\n\"This was a time when the political and social system of the dynasty became stable , and the country also experienced huge changes. China was in frequent contact with the rest of the world at that time, and its artists and scholars also influenced other cultures,\" said Yao Yu, the director of this activity. During this time, Beijing became the capital of China, and Zheng He (1371-1433) set sail and reached the shores of eastern Africa.\nJessica from the British Museum, said _ an artwork may differ in different cultures. \"When a Chinese audience sees a painting you see figures and stories. But we see beautiful views. \" However, she added that the British public had a basic knowledge of the dynasty and many British people probably knew more about the later period of the Ming Dynasty after the Portuguese and Spanish came to China to trade. Their houses and dining tables have Chinese blue and white vases but they don't know much about the earlier period, which in China was a more culturally important period.\n\"We'd like to take away people from the idea that China became international after the Europeans arrived. China in the early Ming Dynasty was very international. \"",
