  "article": "It's a sunny and warm Sunday morning. My parents, my sister and I are all at home. My parents don't have to go to work, and my sister and I don't have to go to school. We are all in the yard  . Look! My father is cleaning his bike. He often goes to work by bike. The bike ride takes him about ten minutes. My mother is watering the flowers. The flowers make our yard very beautiful. We all like the flowers. My sister is playing with a dog. It's her pet dog. The dog is very smart. My mother often takes the dog out for a walk after dinner. What am I doing? I'm drawing. I like drawing very much. I want to join the art club at school.\nIt's a nice day and we're busy in the yard. We are very happy today!\n.",
