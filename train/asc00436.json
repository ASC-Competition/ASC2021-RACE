  "article": "I was born and raised in Minnesota, the USA,but as an adult I have mostly lived in Europe and Africa. I teach cross-cultural management at the International Business School near Paris. For the last 15 years, I've studied how people in different parts of the world build trust,communicate, and make decisions especially in the workplace.\nWhile traveling in Tokyo recently with Japanese colleague,I gave a short talk to a group of 20 managers. At the end, I asked whether there were any questions or comments.No hands went up,so I went to sit down.My colleague whispered to me,\"I think there actually were some comments, Erin.Do you mind if I try?\" I agreed, but I guessed it a waste of breath. He asked the group again, \"Any comments or questions?\"\nStill, no one raised a hand, but this time he looked very carefully at each person in the silent audience. Gesturing to one of them, he said, \"Do you have something to add?\" To my amazement,she responded \"Yes, thank you.\" and asked me a very interesting question. My colleague repeated this several times,looking directly at the audience and asking for more questions or comments.\nAfter the session, I asked my colleague, \"how do you know that those people had questions?\" He hesitated, not sure how to explain it, and then said, \"It has to do with how bright their eyes are.\"\nHe continued, \"In Japan, we don't make as much direct eye contact as you do in the West. So when you asked if there were any comments, most people were not looking directly at you. But a few people in the group were looking right at you, and their eyes were bright. That indicates that they would be happy to have you call on them.\"\nI thought to myself I would never have learned from my upbringing in Minnesota. Since then, I try to focus on understanding behavior in other cultures I encounter, and keep finding the bright eyes in the room.",
