  "article": "It was 1504,and Columbus was making another trip to the New World. Columbus and his men needed fresh water and food after three months at sea. They saw an island and went on shore. On the island there were unfriendly Indians who refused to give food to them. Columbus' men were afraid of the Indians, but he had a clever plan. He used sign language to tell the Indians about his mysterious   power to turn off the light in the sky. He knew about a lunar eclipse   the next night because the information was in his almanac  . Columbus told the Indians, \" Tomorrow night I'll turn off the light in the sky.\" But they didn't believe him . When the eclipse began the next night ,the Indians became very frightened . They begged Columbus to turn on the light again , and they quickly gave him all the food and water he wanted. Immediately Columbus and his men hurried back to the ship and sailed away in the moonless night.",
