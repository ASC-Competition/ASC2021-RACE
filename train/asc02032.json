  "article": "To be able to motivate oneself, or self-motivate, occurs when a person has the willingness to do something and is internally  motivated to do it.\nSometimes it's very difficult to get ourselves moving.The natural tendency is to postpone.Life just seems to get in the way! There is a job to go to, groceries to do, television to watch--whoops! I guess we get pretty good at finding excuses to escape getting started on goals like an exercise routine or reading a new book.The fact is that we are creatures of routine and habit.So what can we do to motivate ourselves to accomplish our goals?\nHere are some tips on how to get moving:\nDecide what you want.It's hard to motivate an aimless mind.Set a goal and decide how you are going to go about it.Then break it down into smaller sections so it's easier to handle and less overwhelming. \nKeep track of your progress.Keep a log or journal where you can measure how much you have accomplished.Looking at it can also motivate you to keep pushing ahead.\nPost motivating pictures or slogans within your sight.It is always inspiring to see pictures of people who have accomplished what you're going for.It makes it attainable and realistic.Likewise, little slogans like \"go for it\" or \"just do it\" can give you the little support you need.\n _ .If you remind yourself to go for the desired promotion, it will re-establish why you are doing what you're doing.\nMake it a habit.Once you have accomplished your objective, e.g.becoming an early riser, keep it up so that it's second nature to you and you don't have to think about it anymore.",
