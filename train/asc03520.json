  "article": "8-year-old Mario spent one day selling lemonade in New Jersey. But he didn't do it for spending money. \"The people in the hospital need more medicine,\" Mario said.\nMario's lemonade stand raised money after a group called Alex's Lemonade Stand, which is an organization that raises money for research on cancers that affect kids.Their research might one day lead to a cure.The organization is named for Alexandra Scott, a girl who died of cancer eight years ago when she was eight years old.Alex' s Lemonade Stand actually began four years earlier before she died.That's when she announced that she wanted to sell lemonade to raise money for a cancer cure for all kids.\nThis year, thousands of kids across the country are selling lemonade to raise money for Alex's foundation.In Maryland, a group of kids at the Children's Guild held a fund - raiser for Alex in April.\nAnd in Florida, Harrison began raise money for Alex's Lemonade Stand last year, when he was seven.This year, he raised more than $ 500 dollars.Harrison hoped it could help kids by scientists finding a cure.He also dreamed of finding a cure himself.\"When I grow up, I'm going to invent these little 'nano-bots' that can swallow cancer.They can fight cancer for you with their little mini - lasers and stuff,\" Harrison said.\n\"To see how that one simple idea grew into this national foundation, all of these supporters coming out in Alex's memory , it' s really special for me.It' s against my expectation,\"said Liz Scott, Alex' s mother.\nWhat made Mario's lemonade stand even more special and amazing than most is that he, too, has cancer--six brain tumors.But Mario is not giving up.And he is determined to help other kids like him--in memory of Alex.\" He lost a lot of friends who were in the hospital,\"said Mario's mom, Anna.\"And he wants to be sure that he doesn't lose anymore.\"",
