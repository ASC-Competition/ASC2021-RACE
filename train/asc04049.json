  "article": "In high school, all Canadian students take part in a very exciting event. It is \"Take Your Children to Work Day\". Students will have a chance to work with their parents. My day took place in my mom's work, the York Region Police Department.\nWhen I arrived, a coach was teaching the officers basic combat skills. Everyone tried their best to practice. I could see them sweating and panting  .\nThe most exciting part of my visit was a stop at the 911 Communication Center. 911 is the same as 110,119 and 120 in China. Every 911 call in the city is answered here. When I entered the center, I stood beside a call dispatcher  arid watched him dealing-with the calls.\nSuddenly, the phone rang, he picked it up and a woman cried for help. There was a robbery in her house. The call dispatcher told her, \"Please calm down and move to the safe place quietly. Don't fight with them. Just let them take what they want. Please make sure you are not hurt. We are sending officers there.\"\nHe followed the call and found the address. The call dispatcher chose the five closest police cars from the satellite map and clicked  to send the policemen.  I saw the police cars from the satellite map were quickly moving to the woman's house. Five minutes later, they arrived .I asked the call dispatcher why he sent five cars. He said, \"There are different levels of emergencies. Robbery is a high priority  ,so we have to send five cars.\" The day was interesting. I leaned how the different departments worked together. The officers were very friendly and admirable.",
