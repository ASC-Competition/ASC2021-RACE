  "article": "Apple is known for offering the best customer service in the consumer technology market, such as Lenovo, Google and Nokia, in customer satisfaction surveys every year .\nA particular story tells of how an Apple store manager broke a rule to earn a new, 10-year-old customer for life.\nMatt tells us this touching story:\nMy daughter has been saving her birthday money and allowance for almost 9 months so that she could afford an iPod touch with a camera in it.\nAs of this morning, she had saved the amount needed and headed to an Apple store in Utah with my wife. They arrived at 10:30 am, not realizing that the store would be closed from 11 am to 2 am that day. As they approach the store, two friendly Apple employees greeted them and said they were sorry, but they were closed.\nMy wife pointed to my daughter who had a mason jar full of cash in her arms and explained why they were there and also pointed out that it was not quite 11 am yet. They again said they were sorry, but could not let them in. My wife and daughter were sad and regretful, but understood and made their way to another store in the mall.\nAbout three stores down, an Apple employee raced after them and explained that the manager was going to make an exception and let them in. Every one of the employees stopped what they were doing as my daughter approached the register.\nAs she took all of the cash out of the mason jar, one employee stepped forward and said, \"I don't mean to bother you, but I have to tell you that this made my day wonderful.\"\nAfter the transaction , my daughter and wife were on their way out, the store manager raised his voice and said to all of the employees, \"Everyone, please give a round of applause for saving her money and buying an iPod today.\"",
