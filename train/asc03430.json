  "article": "Chinese are very generous when it comes to educating their children. Not caring about the money, parents often send their children to the best schools or even abroad to England, the United States or Australia. They also want their children to take extra-course activities where they will learn a musical instrument or ballet or other classes which will give them a head start in life. The Chinese believe that the more expensive an education is, the better it is. So the parents will spend an unreasonable amount of money on education. Even poor couples will buy a computer for their son or daughter.\nHowever, what most parents fail to see is that the best early education they can give their children is usually very cheap.\nParents can see that their children's skills vary, skilled in some areas while poor in others. What most parents fail to realize though, is that today's children lack   self-respect and self-confidence.\nThe problem is that parents are only educating their children on how to take multiple-choice tests and how to study well, but parents aren't teaching them the most important skills they need to be confident, happy and clever.\nParents can achieve this by teaching practical skills like cooking, sewing and doing housework.\nTeaching a child to cook will improve many of the skills that he will need later in life. Cooking demands patience and time. It's an enjoyable but difficult experiment. A good cook always tries to improve his cooking, so he will learn to work hard and gradually to finish his job successfully. His result, a well-cooked dinner, will give him much satisfaction and a lot of self-confidence.\nSome old machines , such as a broken radio or TV set that you give your children to play with will make him curious   and arouse his interest He will spend hours looking at them, trying to fix them; your child might become an engineer when he grows up. These activities aren't merely teaching a child to read a book, but rather to think, to use his mind. And that is more important.",
