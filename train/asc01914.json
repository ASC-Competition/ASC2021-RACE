  "article": "Feeling blue about world ? \"Cheer up.\" Says science writer Matt Ridley.\"The world has never been a better place to live in, and it will keep on getting better both for humans and got nature.\"\nRidley calls himself a tat ional optimist--tactical .because he's carefully weighed the evidence optimistic .because that   offence shows human progress to be both unavoidable and good .And this is what he's set out to prone from unique point of view in his most recent book. The Rant anal Opting  .He views mankind as grand enterprise that .on the whole .has done little but progress for 100.000 years. He backed his finding with hard gathered though years of research.\nHere's how he explains his views.\nShopping fuels invention\nIt is reported that there are more than ten billion different producers for sale in London alone. Even allowing for the many people who still live in poverty .our own generation has access to more nutritious food .more convenient transport .bigger houses, better ears .and of course, more pounds and dollars than any who lived before us .This will continue as long as we there things to make other things, This more we specialize and exchange, the better off we'll be.\n2) Brilliant advances\nOne reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ener before is that the four most basie human needs -food, clothing, fuel and shelter- have grown a lot cheaper. Take one example. In 1800 a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s the same light from an oil lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950 it was eight seconds. Today it's half second.\n3) Let's not kill ourselves for climate change\nMitigating  climate change could prove just as damaging to human welface as climate change itself. A child that dies from indoor smoke in a village, where the use of fassil-fuel  electrieity is forhidden by well meaming members of green polucal movements trying to save the world, is just as great a tragedy as a child that mes in a flood caused by climate change. If chmaic change proves to be xxxx, but cutting carbon canses realparn, we may well find that we have stopped a nose bleed by putting a tournquet  around our necks.",
