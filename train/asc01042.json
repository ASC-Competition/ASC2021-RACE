  "article": "Jenny lived in a town.Her father,Mr.Young,had a shop there and sold clothes in it.The shopkeeper was born in a poor family and was in school no more than a year.He was always sorry for it though he had much money now.He hoped his daughter could become a scientist.But the girl didn't 1ike anything else except singing.She often went to the concerts,bought a lot of records the famous pop stars made and insisted on listening to the music when she was free.Of course she wanted to be a pop star,too.Her parents wanted to prevent her,but she didn't listen to\nthem and they had to agree to her choice.They engaged an old man who was good at music as a private teacher.\nFive years passed.Mr.Young bought all kinds of musical instruments for Jenny and they visited some places where the famous singers were born.Of course he spent a lot of money on it.But he found the girl didn't make any progress.At last the teacher didn't think the girl could become a singer at all and had to tell Mr.Young about it.The man became angry and said,\"Why didn't you tell me about it earlier? My daughter learned nothing but I paid you month after month!\"\n\"I think you should thank me for it,\"said the teacher.\"Another teacher, who teaches\nbadly,is paid more than I was.And I saved much money for you!\"",
