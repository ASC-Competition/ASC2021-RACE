  "article": "As we all know, it was Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Declaration of Independence (<<>> ). He wrote it in two weeks, and after a few changes, it was accepted by the Congress  . As a result, he became famous.\nBorn in 1743 in Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, a wonderful student at school and almost talented( ) lawyer later, was much interested in politics.\nJefferson was elected the Governor of Virginia in 1779, and he was sent to France as the representative of the American government in 1784. Sixteen years later, at the age of 57, he was elected president after Washington and Adams.\nFar from a handsome man, he was tall with long arms and big hands. Jefferson, who was an amusing  talker in conversation but a poor speaker, was generally good-natured.\nJefferson was regarded as a defender of freedom in America. As a president, he protected the right of free speech. Interestingly enough, in his eight years as president, Jefferson never vetoed   a bill which the Congress had passed. He did a lot in organizing the new University of Virginia.\nThomas Jefferson died on July the fourth, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of American Independence.",
