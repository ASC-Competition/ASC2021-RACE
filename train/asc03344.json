  "article": "Spoiled for choice? That's likely how you'll feel after a mere day in Athens. The secret is in not trying to do everything. Instead, take in a couple of the tourist highlights and then get a feel for this attractive capital.\nAn ancient sight\nThe Acropolis   always comes out at the top of the list of things to see in Athens. The most famous of the western world's ancient sights continue to impress tourists as they climb the marble steps and stand before the graceful Parthenon. Views from up here are amazing.\nA slow wander\nPlaka is the city's oldest neighborhood, resting on the slopes of the Acropolis with cafs and fascinating architecture. The streets are perfect for getting lost in, giving wanderers the chance to discover cafs and bars where they can down some strong coffee among locals. Plaka is at its best in the early evening. Acropolis House Pension is a preserved 19thcentury house that gives guests a glimpse into a Greek home.\nA market scene\nVarvakios Agora is Athens' central market. Locals come here to shop and look for everything needed in a Greek kitchen -- from olive oil to meat. This is a look at local life as well as a window into Greek cuisine. The meat market is also home to some of the city's best pubs, feeding traditional food to crowds of customers from all walks of society.\nA splash of nightlife\nAthenian nights are filled with music, dancing and dining. Perivoli Tou Ouranou is a club with a strong atmosphere. Filled with the sounds of violins and guitars pelting out traditional blueslike music, it's sad but also beautiful and lively.",
