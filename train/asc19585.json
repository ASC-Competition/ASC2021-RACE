  "article": "A rich man was ill in hospital, and the doctor feared that his life was ending soon. He called together his three sons and gave them the challenge, 'One of you will get all my money. To decide which of you can get the money, I am going to give each of you a dollar. Go today and buy something that can fill this room.\"\nIn the evening, they all came back. Child number one went to his friend's farm and bought two bales of hay   with the dollar. He brought the hay and threw it up into the air. But it couldn't fill the room.\nChild number two went to a shop and bought two pillows made with feathers . He then opened them and threw the feathers all over the room. All the feathers settled down on the floor and the room was still not filled.\nThe third son took out a candle and said, \"I bought a box of matches and a candle then I gave the rest to a charity.\" He lit the candle and turned off the lights, and the room was filled.\n\" Well done, my son. You will get all my money because you understand a very important lesson about life. You understand how to let your light shine. That is good.\" said the father.",
