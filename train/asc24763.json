  "article": "October 21st,2011\nDear Vincent,\nI'm a middle school student in Zhejiang , China. My English teacher , Ms.Li gave me your name and address. I want to be your pen friend.\nEnglish is my favourite subject.That's why I want to practise English with an American student. I also like art. It's so interesting and useful.I like history, too. Our history teacher always tells us a lot of interesting historical stories. We all have a good time in history classes.\nIn my free time, I enjoy playing computer games . It's exciting and fun. Do you like it ? I also like to go to the movies. I saw Harry Potter and the DeathlyHallows:Part 1 yesterday. It was a great film.But I don't like sports, so I never enjoy P.E.classes.\nHow about you? What subjects do you like? What do you look like? What do you want to do when you get older? I hope I can get your letter soon!\nYours,\nZhao Gang",
