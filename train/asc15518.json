  "article": "Senior citizens are permitted to travel cheaply on a bus if they have a special card. Women may get cards when they are sixty.\nMrs. Matthews lived in the country but she went into town once a week to buy food and other things for the house, and she usually went by bus. She always had to pay the full price for her ride.\nThen she reached the age of sixty and got her senior citizen's card, but when she used it for the first time on the bus, it made her feel very old.\nThe bus driver had often seen her traveling on the bus before, and he noticed that she was feeling unhappy, so after she had paid her money, he winked at her and whispered, \"Don't forget to give your mother's card back to her when you see her again.\"\nMrs. Matthews was very happy when she heard this.",
