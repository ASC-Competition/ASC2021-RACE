  "article": "The playwright George Bernard Shaw once said humorously, \"England and America are two nations divided by a common language. If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'\".\nTwo completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \"Hi\" and end with a \"Bye\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \"xoxo\" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients   about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America.\nEuromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal \"Dear Mr. X\" and ending with a simple \"Sincerely\". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves.\nRecently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations:\n\"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\"\n\"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\"\n\"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\".\n\"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\"\nSo which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues. If the alternative is a few earnestly written, carefully worded bits of Euromail, then I say, \"Bring it on.\"",
