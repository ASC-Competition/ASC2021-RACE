  "article": "A mansion  may symbolize the American dream. But the fact is, for most immigrants, the closest one they ever get to is the neighboring bushes.\n    Such is the case with 63-year-old Catalino Tabia, Calif. He's a gardener with a 6'h grade education. He came to America to make his dreams come true, but ended up fulfilling everyone else's.\"I always wanted to be somebody,\" Tabia said.\"But now I just want the opportunity to help others.\"\n    That is why, not long ago, Tabia started the Bay Area Gardeners Foundation. It's a charity aiming at helping smart kids like Noel Chavez, whose dream was to become the first in his family to graduate from college.Unfortunately, since Noel is still waiting for his citizenship, he's not qualified for financial aid.And after just a few months of going to school full-time and working full-time, he was ready to give in.\n    \"I'm working too much. I'm not going to do it. It's impossible. But then you get some help, and that's my break. \"  The break was a  $  1,500 scholarship from the Gardeners Foundation. In the last two years, the foundation has awarded 13 such prizes to low-income kids, regardless of citizenship. And Tabia plans to give out hundreds more.\n    How does a gardener come up with that kind of cash?  \"I was thinking and thinking and suddenly, the clients V \" he said.\"That's where the money is coming from. We work for clients with a lot of money. \" Tabia and his gardener friends just started knocking on those mansion doors-and the checks have been rolling in ever since.  \"There might be some gardeners at your graduation,\" someone said to Noel.\"I'm sure there will and I'm going to invite them,\" he replied.\n    Tabia is now hoping this idea catches on with the gardeners around the country. And whether that happens or not, and whether he realizes it or not, Tabia has already finished what he came to America to do-become somebody.",
