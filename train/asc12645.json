  "article": "It was a cold December, and Mrs. Bell wanted to do a lot of shopping. She waited until it was Saturday, when her husband was free, and she took him to the shops with her to pay for everything and to carry for her what she had bought. They went to a lot of shops, and Mrs. Bell bought everything she could think of.\nShe often stopped and said, \"Look, Peter! Isn't that beautiful?\"\n\"All right, my dear. How much is it?\" answered Mr. Bell, and then he took money out to buy it for her.\nIt was almost dark when they came out of the last shop, and Mr. Bell was tired. He was thinking about a nice drink by the side of a warm fire home. Suddenly his wife looked up at the sky and said, \"Look at that beautiful moon, Peter!\"\nWithout stopping, Mr. Bell answered at once. \"All right, dear. How much is it?\" Then he took his wallet out of his pocket.",
