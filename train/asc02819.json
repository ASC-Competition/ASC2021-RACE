  "article": "\"Is it possible for Brownie not to be glad to be back after a happy stay at my uncle's?\"Miss Gauss asked Dad.\"It'll be all right.  Give her a bit more to eat,\" he said in a low voice, without tearing his eyes  from Brownie while his wife was busy packing Brownie's belongings, saying,\"Brownie is not so cute as her younger brother, Spotty.  Take care of the little thing when walking him.\"\nIt happened on the night of July 10th, 2013 before the Gausses took a trip to Hawaii. They entrusted their pet to me  because they thought I was the first person they'd confide in. And another intention of theirs was that I had already trained Spotty into a wellknown pet in my community, which can act many tricks, such as \"Sit down!\"  \"Stand up!\"  \"Give me your right hand!\" \"Turn around!\"  She can even sing,  and,  of course,  that's just a strange sharp noise.  Having seen them off, I took beautiful Brownie home in my arms, for fear that he would slip away.\n _ so I tried many ways to be his friend, which made Spotty rather unhappy. They often fought a battle, seemingly to break my roof loose. Soon, Brownie turned out to be an agreeable family member. He was an endearing pet, often begging for comforts in my arms. I seized the chance to train him and he achieved a lot, which I texted Mr.Gauss. They were so overjoyed and decided to fly home ahead of time to see Brownie's qualitative change.\nBut,all this was thoroughly destroyed because of Brownie's death in a traffic accident.  What a poor little creature!He was really dogged  by bad luck,  and he was saved from death shortly after his birth.  For whatever reason,therefore, I was overwhelmed by feelings of guilt, which seemed to run most deeply in me.\nThe best way to cheer ourselves up is to try first to cheer somebody else up. That will be an everlasting pain in my heart, a wound that does not heal.",
