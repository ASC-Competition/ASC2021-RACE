  "article": "The quickest way to make friends with others is to smile  . When you smile, people think you are friendly and easy to talk to. It may not be easy to smile at first, but you can practice it in front of a mirror  . When you look at yourself in the mirror, think about the difference between a smiling face and a sad or an angry face. Most people will stay away from  a sad or an angry face.\nThe easiest way to start a conversation with someone is to say something nice about him or her. For example, you can _ someone's great answer to a teacher's question, a great prize, a nice shirt, etc. Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you. Doesn't it make you want to keep talking with that person? Also, ask your new friends questions about themselves. For example, who are their favorite singers and what do they do after school are all good questions to start a conversation.",
