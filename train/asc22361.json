  "article": "MIT ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology)   is a world-class university mainly in math, science and technology, but you may be surprised to learn that MIT sets arts courses.\nMIT believe in the passion   of learning, the value of working and teaching methods. MIT's teaching power is quite strong. There are eight Nobel winners and many other national and international winners in the teacher group of MIT. MIT is proud of these top scholars and thinkers.\nThe ratio   of teachers and students in MIT is about 1 to 7.5. About 63 percent of the classes have fewer than 20 students each. Only 4 percent of the classes have more than 100 students each. Most MIT students can learn courses that they like.\nThe students in MIT have many activities when they finish their lessons, for example:\nStudent Life And Culture\nStudent Organizations\nMusic & The Arts @ MIT\nAthletics\nMost students in famous universities feel serious pressure both in life and study. In MIT the students have the same pressure which encourages them to have to study hard. But MIT usually gives one year for the new students to adjust   to the transition (;). In their first term all the new students are graded by a test. In this test if he or she receives a C or the level better than C, his or her result will be kept forever. If she or he receives a D or an F, no record will be kept.",
