  "article": "Too often young people get themselves employed quite by accident, not knowing what lies in the way of opportunity for promotion, happiness and security. As a result, they are employed in doing jobs that afford them little or no satisfaction.\nOur school leavers face so much competition that they seldom care what they do as long as they can earn a living. Some stay long at a job and learn to like it; others leave one for another looking for something to suit them. The young graduates who leave the university look for jobs that offer a salary up to their expectation.\nVery few go out into the world knowing exactly what they want and realizing their own abilities. The reason behind all this confusion is that there never has been a proper vocational   guidance in our educational institution. Nearly allfeel their way in the dark. Their chief concern when they lookfor a job is to ask what salary is like. They never bother tothink whether they are suited for the job or, even more important, whether the job suits them. Having a job is more thanmerely providing yourself and your dependants  with daily bread and some money for leisure and entertainment.It sets a pattern of life and, in many ways, determines social status in life, selection of friends, leisure and interest.\nIn choosing a profession you should first consider the type of work which will suit your interest. Nothing is more sad than taking on a job in which you have no interest, for it will not only ruin your talents but also discourage your desire to succeed in life.",
