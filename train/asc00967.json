  "article": "I created a writing group at my school this year, and it has become a _ with all students who enjoy writing. Now students of the group make rapid progress in their writing. Let me share a few tips that you can use to start your own writing group.\nSet up separate groups for different ability levels\nYou probably don't want to mix a gifted eighth grader with a second grader who writes very little. In a larger school, you could have a beginner group, a more advanced group, and a publishing group. Members can move to more appropriate groups if they are not comfortable in the current one.\nAdvertise the group in different ways\nSend advertisements home with students, and put an advertisement on the school website or in the school newsletter.\nThe first meeting should be very open\nAt the first meeting, you should tell the students that this group is all about them. It is not a class, not a grade and not a requirement. Then tell them what some other writing groups do, and ask what they would like to do.\nSet up a time to meet once or twice a month\nIt is important that students bring their writing with them. The group could go in any direction: criticize each other's work, read your writing aloud, read silently, publish your work in a booklet  , play creativity games or do an online chat with a published author.\nIt will take a little while to find out what works best for your group\nSearch for creativity exercises and role plays. You might even be able to set up a special section of your school's website just for your writing group.",
