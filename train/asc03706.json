  "article": "A handsome man can earn a fifth more than an average-looking colleague but a beautiful woman is not paid a penny more than her average-looking colleague, new research has shown.\nThe study by senior economists found that being good-looking meant male workers could earn 22 percent more than average-looking colleagues. Researchers said good looks did not give women a similar advantage.\nAndrew Leigh, a former economics professor at the Australian National University who co-authored the report, said: \"Beauty can be a double-edged sword for women.\"\n\"Some people still believe good looks and intelligence are incompatible  in women, so a good-looking women can't be that productive, but it doesn't affect men's pay.\"\nHe said that although he believed good-looking women may also earn more, the research did not support his theory.\nThe research found that handsome men in all jobs, from manual labour to highly-paid professional careers, can earn 22 percent more than their colleagues doing the same work.\nMen with below-average looks face a battle in the office, with ugliness reducing a man's earnings by 26 percent compared to an average-looking worker.\nFormer male model, Caitlan Mitchell, 28, who has a first class degree in history from Edinburgh University and now works for a cosmetics company, told theSunday Times:' It gives you confidence, and I suspect people tend to warm to you more quickly.\"\nThe study, named Unpacking the Beauty Premium, was the largest exercise of its kind and repeated a survey from 1984 to see if the beauty premium  had changed.\nLeigh said the research showed people in the workplace were \"lookist \"and he hoped the findings would encourage employers to remove their prejudice.",
