  "article": "As we know, there are differences between western culture and Chinese culture. We can see  differences  when we pay attention to the words that are used. Let's look at the words about describing animals. Most phrases in Chinese about the dog. For example, \" a  homeless dog\", \"a running dog\",  and \" a dog catching a mouse\", have negative meanings.\nBut in western countries, dogs are considered honest and good friends of humans. In English, people use dogs to describe positive behavior. For example, \"You are  lucky dog\" means you are a  lucky person.   And  \"Every dog has its day\" means _ . To describe a person's serious illness, they say \"sick as a dog\". The  word  \"dog-tired\"  means  \" very tired\". The  words  about animals are used in positive or negative ways in different cultures. We can learn about many differences in cultures by comparing how certain words are used.",
