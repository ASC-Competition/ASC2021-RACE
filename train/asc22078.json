  "article": "When we buy a house, we all want to have nice neighbours, because most of us think that it is helpful to live with some good neighbours. But what kind of neighbour is good? The answers are different from people to people. Here are my answers.\nFirst, it is very important to respect  each other. If our neighbours try to know more about our life, what will we feel? He or she may also talk with others about our life. Do you want to live with him or her any more? The answer is \"No\". We will feel very sad to have this kind of neighbour and move away quickly.\nNext, a good neighbour is always ready to give us a hand when we need him or her. For example, if we are not at home, our good neighbours will watch our house for us.\nFinally, a good neighbour should love the environment . He or she never puts rubbish  here and there. Good neighbours should keep the place clean, because the good environment can make us comfortable and happy.\nI think we all should learn to be good neighbours, and I also hope everyone will have good neighbours and live a happy life.",
