  "article": "\"Hey, do you know what?  Today is May Day!\" my sister announced. \"Do you remember the May Day baskets we used to make with colored paper and paste?\"\nI recalled that my sisters and I would run around our neighborhood delivering the baskets brimming with spring flowers. We would place them on a doorstep, knock on the door, then run away. It was delightful to look around a bush and watch our friends open their doors and pick up the colorful gift,wondering who had left it out for them.\nI clearly remember the May Day of the year that I was in fifth grade. That year I was faced with a challenge involving one of my dearest friends. She lived right across the road from our family, and we had walked together to school nearly every day since first grade.\nHer interests were starting to change from the interests that we had shared together. A new family had recently moved into our small town,and Pam was spending more and more time at their house.\nWhen my mother asked me if I was going to take a May Day basket to Pam's house, I responded angrily, \"Absolutely not!\" My mom told me that I would have many other friends throughout my lifetime. \"But Pam was my very best friend ever,\" I cried. Mom wiped away my tears and told me that circumstances change and people change. She explained that one of the greatest things friends can do is to give each other a chance to grow, to change and to develop into what we want to be. And sometimes that would mean that friends would choose to spend time with other people. I could express my forgiveness by giving her a May Day basket.\nIt was a hard decision, but I made an extra special basket of flowers with lots of yellow because that was Pam's favorite color. I asked my two sisters to help me deliver my basket of forgiveness. As we watched from our hiding place, Pam picked up the flowers, and said loudly enough for us to hear, \"Thank you, Susie, I hoped you wouldn't forget me!\".",
