  "article": "The old camera Brownie picked up in a charity shop was a splendid find. But the undeveloped film still inside turned out to be even more of a treasure.\nNew owner Don Roccoforte had it developed and saw in it an attractive dark haired woman in her thirties with two young boys. He immediately determined to try to find out who they were.\nA few weeks later the California-based camera collector received the news that left him _ . The woman was his wife Jaqueline's aunt in a picture taken around 50 years ago, and one of the boys, her cousin.\nThe couple have now unraveled the astonishing coincidence, which leads back to Mrs. Roccoforte's native Lancashire, where many of her family still live. The camera was bought from a shop in Preston, England by Brownie, a friend of Mr. Roccoforte, who knew of his interest in photography and thought it would be an unusual gift.\nBack in California, the contents of his new possession inspired Mr. Roccoforte's curiosity. Recognizing the water in the background of the photo as a lake in Lancashire, he sent a copy to the local paper in Preston to see if any readers could help.\nAnother relative recognized the group as Winnie Bamber, still living in the area at the age of 81, her son Tony, Mrs. Roccoforte's cousin, and Tony's childhood friend, Mick Murphy.\nYesterday Mrs. Bamber was still gasping  at the turn of events which has reunited two strands of her family. She said she remembered taking the boys to the lake and losing the camera. The two boys, both now 58, still live near Preston.\nMrs. Roccoforte's father is Winnie Bamber's brother, Billy Charnley. He and his wife moved to America in the 1960s. Their daughter met Mr. Roccoforte there and they married and moved to Preston for two years before returning to America.",
