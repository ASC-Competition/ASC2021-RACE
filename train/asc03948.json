  "article": "Just saw the superhero movie, Kick-Ass, and it raised an interesting question: just because we are not superhuman, can we lead a super-heroic life? I believe we can do it in some easy steps!\nActivate  our super powers.\nSuperheroes are all good at different things. Some are really fast, some can see things others can't, and some can move things with their mind. Also we all have special talents and passions. We just have to know what they are and develop them.\nTry this. List several things you're especially good at-- we'll say these are your core super powers. Next, write down what makes each of your core super powers and look for chances to use them and improve them.\nGet a _ or two.\nSuperheroes are out there all day, fighting the good fight. And who's there to help? Every superhero has teamed up with someone else to defeat some enemies they couldn't deal with alone.\nWe need a support team: one or more who can be trusted and will help us when necessary. Our team members should bring different, constructive perspectives  and all kinds of super powers. But we must choose wisely.\nBe brave and bold.\nDoes it take more courage to venture  down a dark road or to face a life of no ventures at all? Both can be pretty scary. But we should be brave and bold just as some successful person said: \"Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition .\"\nLive the code.\nSuperheroes die to protect others. They don't cheat or lie or steal. They're good role models, and they do the right things even when nobody is watching.\nThough nobody's perfect, yet we should learn from superheroes and struggle not to disobey the superhero code. Turn a friend down who trusts me? Of course I won't.",
