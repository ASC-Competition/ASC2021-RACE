  "article": "Smith had a small garden, and in spring she planted some vegetables in it. She looked after them very carefully, and when summer came, they looked very nice.\nOne evening Mrs. Smith looked at her vegetables and said: \" Tomorrow I am going to pick them, and then we can eat them.\"\nBut early the next morning, her daughter ran into the kitchen and shouted , \"Come quickly! Our neighbor's  ducks are in the garden and they are eating our vegetables.\"\nMrs. Smith ran out, but it was too late! All the vegetables were finished! Mrs. Smith cried and made her neighbor very sorry, but that was the end of the vegetables.\nThen several days before Christmas, the neighbor gave  Mrs. Smith a parcel . In it was a beautiful, fat duck, and on it was a piece of paper with the words, \" Enjoy your vegetables.\"\n,",
