  "article": "Imagine a stranger walking past you on a cold, rainy day. \"Lovely weather, isn't it?\" the stranger says. Do you laugh, or even smile? If not, you may not have a dry sense of humor.\nBritish people, and particularly the English, are well-known for our dry sense of humor. We often say the opposite of what we mean in order to be funny, and tell jokes in a tone of voice that makes it sound like we are being completely serious. As US writer Julian Tan put it on the HuffPost Students blog: \"It is as if it is 'Opposite Day' every day in Britain.\"\nIf the people of Britain are known for having a \" _ \" and not showing emotion, then our dry sense of humor shows this through jokes. Often it will take a long time or several beers, to get a British person to tell you what they actually think about something and get behind the wall of humorous sarcasm   that they have in front of them.\nEnglish comedian Ricky Gervais put it like this: \"We play jokes on our friends. We use sarcasm as a shield   and a weapon. We avoid being serious until it's absolutely necessary.\"\nIt can be annoying and confusing if you haven't been raised with these types of jokes: \"Why did he just say such a ridiculous thing? Is he making fun of me?\" But it is also true that understanding this type of humor is a good way to make friends with people in the UK, even if you don't find it funny.\nIt's important to remember that the person telling the joke may actually be making fun of himself or herself, not you. One of the characteristics of British humor is \"its strong theme of self-deprecation\" (making fun of oneself), according to Tan. So don't worry - often, English people, and British people in general, just want to make fun of themselves!",
