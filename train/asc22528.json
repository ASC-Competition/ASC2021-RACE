  "article": "The brain receives information from the outside world through the sensory   system.This information is collected through the eyes,the nose,the ears,the mouth and the surface of the body.It is then kept in the memory.In fact,scientists do not completely understand how the memory works but they are not sure how much information that the human brain can store.Also, it appears that the information is never lost.Very old people often remember things that happened in their childhood which have not come to their minds for sixty to seventy years.If we have kept something in our memory, it is here.But can we get it out again and use it? That is the difficulty.\nSome of the information we receive only goes into the Short Term Memory.We only keep this information for a minute or two,then we lose it.This temporary   memory is very important in our thinking and understanding.It is used,for example,when you try to remember a name that someone told you a moment ago or a telephone number that you are going to dial  .School children in class often seem to use the Short Term Memory if they are not interested in the subject.When school teachers describe this,they say that things go\"in one ear and out in the other\".But if a child is interested,he puts the information in his Long Term Memory, and he never loses it.Long Term Memory depends heavily on our understanding of the meaning of the information we receive.",
