  "article": "My students often tell me they don't have \"enough time\" to do all their schoolwork. My reply is often brief -You have as much time as the president. I usually carry on a bit about there being 24 hours per day for everyone, and suggest that \"not enough time\" is not an acceptable explanation of not getting something done.\nOnce in graduate school, I tried to justify myself to one of my professors by saying that I was working. His answer to me was, \" _ . What's important is the quality of your work.\" Since then I have had time to reflect on the \"hard worker\" dodge , and I have come to some conclusions - all relevant to the issue of how much time we have.\nIf you look at the matter analytically, you can identify two parts of the problem. There is, of course, the matter of \"time\", which we can think of as fixed. Then there is the issue of \"work\" during that time, which can vary in intensity. But, as my professor suggested, it's not diligence but the quality of the product that is important.\nThat led me to a new idea, the quality of work. That concept is perhaps best explained by a sign I once saw on the wall in someone's office - Don't work harder but work smarter! There's a lot of sense in that idea.\nIf you can't get more time, and few of us can, the only solution is to improve the quality of work. That means thinking of ways of getting more out of the same time than we might otherwise get. That should lead us to an analysis of our work habits. Since \"work\" for students usually means \"homework\", the expression \"work habits\" should be read as \"learning habits\".\nThen, as a smart student, you will seek to improve those skills that you use in study, chiefly reading and writing. If you learn to read better and write better, there are big benefits that pay off across the board in all your studies.",
