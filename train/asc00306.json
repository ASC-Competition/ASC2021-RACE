Please look at them and tell us your impressions.\nStone House, Portugal\nThe stone house in Portugal is really similar to the famous home of the Flintstones (<<>> ). It is built between two rocks and its architecture  has impressed some of the greatest architects. The house was attacked by some bad people. The house is pretty comfortable inside, with a fireplace and every- thing necessary, so it is a wonderful example of modern architecture in Stone Age style!\nDancing Building, Czech Republic\nThe Dancing House, or \"Fred and Ginger\", is situated in Prague, the Czech Republic. It is an amazing masterpiece of architecture which has its own romantic charm. There is something so sweet in the way the buildings hug each other for a dance! It has become a symbol of the city!\nThe Crooked   House, Poland\nThe crooked house in Poland has an extraordinary and amazing structure. It was built in 2003 with its design based on the pictures of Jan Marcin Szancer and Per Dahlberg. It looks as if it has been taken from a cartoon: its design is \"crooked\", but it is balanced, so it is not ugly at all, just strange! The interesting part is how builders managed to create this genius idea, but the house is a fact and everyone admires their creativity!\nHabitat 67, Montreal, Canada\nHabitat 67 in Canada is a very interesting arrangement of cubes,which looks like the building blocks that children play with. It is pretty interesting how it was designed -- it looks so original, and at the same time the building is completely stable  and comfortable for living! It was created as a main attraction for Expo  67, where it was officially exposed!",
