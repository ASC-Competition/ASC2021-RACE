  "article": "Once a great boxer , Tom Brown, went to a restaurant for dinner. He put his bag near the door, but he was afraid that someone would take it away. So he got out a pen and a piece of paper and wrote on it, \"The great boxer, Tom Brown, left his bag here and he will be back in a few minutes.\" He put the paper on his bag and went to have his dinner. When he came back, his bag wasn't there. But he found a piece of paper on the ground. It said, \"A great runner took away your bag, and will not be back.\"",
