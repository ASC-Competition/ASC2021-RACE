  "article": "Square dancing is a form of entertainment and physical exercise, which is a good thing. However, a group of senior Chinese ladies dancing in New York's Sunset Park were recently faced with noise complaints from nearby residents. The local court even served a summons   related to a certain Ms. Wang.\nThe news soon caused heated discussion across China, with many believing the incident to involve a cultural conflict between the East and West,while others view it as a form of discrimination against Chinese in the United States.\nThe United States is a diverse society, and in many cases, Chinese dancers are tolerated and even appreciated. Meanwhile, the United States is a society based on the rule of law, and due to cultural differences, local regulations seem to be very different from those in China. As a result, some old Chinese ladies dancing in New York's Sunset Park found themselves caught in an embarrassing situation. Locals and immigrants from other nations view such noise as a violation of their right to enjoy _ . Calling the police is regarded as the most efficient way to solve such a problem.\nBefore, these ladies probably did not understand local customs and rules. However, since the incident took place, they should perhaps know a little better next time and keep the noise to a minimum. People from different nations are often supposed to reach compromises, respecting and tolerating each other.\nWhatever your choice of entertainment, it is important not to affect other people's lives. Square dancing is only one of many activities during which people should mind their behavior.\nAs for U.S. police practice, there might still be some room for improvement. Some were said to be rather rude, leading to the so-called \"racial discrimination,\" which is a sensitive topic in U.S. society.\nIf the involved parties could be more tolerant, and solve such problems without involving the court, perhaps immigrants would mix more.",
