  "article": "With her adopted son, she travels the world making movies and dispensing  hope. Angelina Jolie lives in two worlds: Hollywood, where she makes movies and stays in five-star hotels, and the refugee  camps of Africa and Asia, where she works with the UN, bringing hope to the homeless. She feels most alive, most herself, she says, working with refugees, yet still feel grateful for life. \nAt 24, Jolie won an Oscar for playing in Girl Interrupted, but found little satisfac-tion in stardom or the wealth that came with it. The daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress Marcheline Bertrand, she had already seen the downside of celebrity--her parents divorced when Jolie was a child. And she always burst into tears when metioned that. After she finished shooting Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Jolie volunteered to be a UN ambassador   and returned to Cambodia to visit refugee camps. She found a calling, and realized that her fame and money could be used to accomplish a world of good. \nNow the mother of son Maddox, 3, whom she adopted in Cambodia, Angelina Jolie hopes to adopt more children. We caught up with her in Beverly Hills on a day away from the set. She talked to us about her role as the mother of Alexander the Great (played by Colin Farrell) in her new movie, Alexander, her passion for helping the homeless, and her longing for a partner with whom she might share it all.",
