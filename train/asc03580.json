  "article": "Dear Editors,\nOn my way to work every morning I drive by a farm where I can see some horses off in the distance in the woods. They are there every single morning no matter how cold or rainy or windy it is. There is a shed on the farm, but it doesn't look to me that the horses are ever taken into the shed. Is this right? I don't think horses should be treated like this.\nSam\nDear Sam,\nThanks for taking an interest in these horses. Problems about the care of horses are different from cats and dogs. Think of wild horses that spend their whole lives outdoors finding whatever food and shelter they can on their own. The point is that horses don't require as much shelter as a lot of other farm animals. However, that doesn't mean that they don't need some shelter.\nIt is hard to tell from your letter whether the situation for these horses is unacceptable. Above all, do you know the people who own the horses well enough to just talk to them as a neighbor and express your concern  ? Maybe they will tell you that the horses do go in the shed at night.\nIf direct contact  is not a choice and you can see that the horses' situation is poor, then call 911, report the situation and ask law enforcement officers   to look into it.\nIf you just can't see enough to prove such a report, call the Oswego Court Humane Society on 207-1070 for help from the Large Animal Assistance Project (LAAP). A volunteer from the project will help solve the problem.\nSpeaking of volunteer assistance, since you appear to be a horse lover, why not talk to the LAAP about volunteer opportunities for you? It's big job, but totally rewarding, and the project always needs knowledgeable horse people to help.",
