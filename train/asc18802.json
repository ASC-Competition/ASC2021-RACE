  "article": "Mr. and Mrs. Long had one daughter. Her name was Lena. She was eighteen years old. Lena lived with her parents and worked in an office. She had some friends, but she didn't like any of the boys very much.\nOne day she met a very nice man. He was young. His name was Watts and he worked in a post office. They became friends and he came to Lena's parents house twice. Last week Lena said to her father, \"I'm going to marry  Watts, Daddy. He was here yesterday.\"\n\"Oh, yes.\" her father answered. \"He's a nice boy, but has he got much money?\"\n\"Oh, no, both of you are the same,\" the daughter answered angrily. I met Watts on the first day of June and the next day he asked me, \"Has your father got much money?\"",
