  "article": "The editor of the new Cool Camping Britain guide chooses some of his favorite new finds in England, Wales and Scotland.\nCleadale, Isle of Eigg, Inner Hebrides\nIs this Britain's most beautiful campsite? From the grassy point looking seaward to the mountains, it's not hard for campers to see how the island inspired The Lord of the Rings author's fantasy landscapes. The campsite itself is as wild and wonderful as its setting.\nOpen April -- September, from PS5 per tent per night.\nSwattesfield, Thornham Magna, Suffolk\nDeep in the wilds of north Suffolk, this seven-acre campsite has only been open for a few years, with two fields separated by a lake and surrounded by woodland. The position is perfect. It's a great place to do nothing but get into nature. You can put up your tent in the bottom field or the woodland beyond.\nOpen Easter -- October, from PS10 per tent per night.\nPleasant Streams Farm, near St Austell, Cornwall\nThis site, by a lake, is all about simple pleasures. Located in the former mining village, it has a summerhouse with books and games for a rainy day. There are many animals including pigs, hens, goats and ducks on the farm and a pub just a 10- minute stroll away. There's very little to do here, no bells and no whistles. Campfires are encouraged.\nOpen Easter -- September, from PS10 per tent per night.\nTroytown Campsite, St Agnes, Isles of Sciily\nIts only campsite, Troytown, couldn't be in a more remote position. Isolation is its greatest advantage -- so bring plenty of books to read and don't expect a phone signal. But at least one of life's necessities is available. Lying on the hillside overlooking the bay and near the island of the Gugh, it might just win the prize for best beer garden view in England.\nOpen March October, from PS7. 50 per tent per night,",
