  "article": "Inprefix = st1 /Kansas City,Missouri, a computer helps fire fighters. The computer, which works very fast, has information about all the 350,000 street addresses in the city. Within two or three seconds after a call is received, the computer provides necessary information for the fire fighters. The information is then sent to them by radio from the computer centre in the City Hall. The exact place of the burning building and its size, type and any other details are clear to them.\n   TheKansas Citycomputer system also has a medical record of each of the city's 900 fire fighters. This kind of information is especially useful when a fire fighter is injured. With the information, doctors at hospital can treat the injured fire fighters more quickly and easily.\n   The fire fighters themselves greatly appreciate   the computer's help. They know about possible danger ahead of them and can prepare for it. Many times the computer information helps to save lives and property  . Sometimes the lives are those of fire fighters themselves.\nMike Horan, a fire fighter captain, says, \"I feel as if the computer is watching over me to help me if I get hurt.\"",
