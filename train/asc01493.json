  "article": "America, has always had people of many different nationalities and languages. The 1990 census   indicates that almost 14% of Americans speak a non-English language at home. Yet only 3% reported that they spoke English \"not well\" or \"not at all \". That means that slightly more than one out of 10 Americans could be considered _ . Besides that, many high school and college students---and even some elementary school students---are required to take a foreign language. Actually, a growing number of Americans are coming to appreciate the benefits of using different languages.\nEthnic enclaves   have preserved the language and culture of American immigrants. Some local residents can function quite well in their native language, without having to bother learning English. Regions such as southern Florida and the Southwest have numerous Spanish-speaking neighborhoods. In fact, Spanish speakers---numbering over 17 million---form the largest non-English linguistic group in America. But Chinese, Vietnamese, Italian, Polish and many other ethnic group add to the linguistic flavor of America. Foreign languages are so commonly used in some ethnic neighborhoods that visitors might think they are in another country!\nAlthough some Americans welcome this linguistic and cultural diversity, others have begun to fear that the English language is being threatened. Since the 1980s, the \"English Only \" movement has sought to promote legislation   which would establish English as the \"official language\" and restrict the use of non-English language. However, some groups, including TESOL, the organization for Teachers of English to Speakers of Other language, object to such \"language restrictionism\". But so far, 19 states have passed \"English Only\" legislation, and the topic is the focus of an ongoing debate.\nWhether or not English is the official language of the United States, it remains the \"language of wider communication\". Nearly everyone recognizes the need to develop the ability in using English in order to do well in America. American also recognize that English is the international language, and people with good English skills can get by in many international settings. On the other hand, in a world growing increasingly smaller, second language skills can be a great favor. They can build cross-cultural bridges and give people an edge in a variety of career field. Indeed, lack of foreign language skill can limit one's chances for advancement and keep one in a cultural dead-end street.",
