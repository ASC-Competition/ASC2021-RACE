  "article": "Many years ago my student asked me the question, \"Mrs. Kindred, why do you teach?\" Without taking time to reflect, I answered, \"Because someday I might say something that might make a difference in someone's life.\" Even though I was sincere, that wasn't a very good answer and my student didn't let it slide.\n\"Let me get this straight,\" he said, \"You went to college for four years so you could come here every day because you have the hope that someday you might say something that will influence someone?\" He shook his head as if I were crazy and walked away looking confused. I'm one of those people who look back and wish they had said something smart or witty, or swift.\nEven though that particular student might no longer wonder why I teach, there are days when I wonder. On those days, I remind myself of the real reasons I teach:\nIt's in my blood. My mother was my most influential teacher, and she was a 6th grade reading teacher until her death in 1990. She instilled  in me a love of reading and the knowledge that education opens doors.\nTeaching is a way to make a difference. If you throw a stone in a pond the ripples go on and on until they reach the shore. You can't have ripples without a \"stone.\" Good teachers throw stones that make a positive difference, and that's what I strive to do.\nI genuinely love teenagers. I want to share with others what I know and what I have learned through the years. Life is full of ups and downs, and if I can help students avoid some potholes on the road of life, I want to do so. If they'll allow me to celebrate their victories with them, I want to do too.\nTeaching isn't for everyone, but I know I made the right career choice.",
