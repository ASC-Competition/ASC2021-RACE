  "article": "Life is like a train ride. We get on. We ride. We get off. We get back on and ride some more. There are accidents and there are delays .At certain stops, there are surprises. Some of these will change into great moments of joy; some will result in bad results.\nWhen we are born and we first get on the train, we meet people who we think will be with us for the whole journey. Those people are our parents. Sadly, this is far from the truth. Our parents are with us when we completely need them. They, too, have journeys they must complete. We live on with the memories of their love, support and so on.\nThere are others who get on the train and who finally become very important to us. These people are our brothers, sisters and friends, whom we will learn to love and take care of.\nSome people regard their journey as a pleasant tour. They will just go happily along. Others will _ many upsets, tears and losses on their journey. Some others will stay on to offer a helping hand to anyone in need.\nSome people on the train will leave a deep impression  when they get off. Some will get on and get off the train so quickly that they will hardly leave a sign.\nWe will sometimes be upset that some passengers, whom we love, will choose to sit in another compartment  and leave us to travel on our own. Then again, there's nothing that says we can't look for them anyway. But when we find them, we may not even be able to sit next to them because that seat will already be taken.\nThat's okay... everyone's journey will be filled with hopes, dreams, challenges, difficulties and goodbyes.",
