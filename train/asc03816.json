  "article": "The Internet can be a great way to connect with people. The latest web craze is social networking on websites such as MySpace. More than 65 million young people use online social networking sites.\nThat cyberspace  trend is causing problems in school, however. In a recent survey, nearly 36 percent of school administrators said that social networking sites troubled learning in their districts. Should school districts ban sites like MySpace?\nTeachers are worried that some students use social networking to post personal information and to cyber bully  other students. One of the biggest dangers comes from people who find out kid's personal information.\nMany districts have blocked students from accessing or using social networking sites from school computers, and some have suspended  students for posting harmful material on those sites from their home computers. Nearly two-thirds of US kids have computers in their homes, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\"It is important to keep in mind that just blocking access to social web sites at school is not the end of the story,\" warns NSBA executive director Anne Bryant, \"Most of the misuse of these sites takes place at home but still affects the classroom.\"\n _ . They say the main problem with sites like MySpace is that students don't understand the dangers involved in using them. \"Many students are posting personal information about themselves without regard to who has access to that information,\" Jim Hirsch said, \"Schools should focus on educating their students and their parents on how to be safe online.\"\nExperts argue that too many schools are forbidding students to use social networking web sites without thinking about their educational benefits. \"Social networking web sites can help connect students in the United States to their peers in other countries, providing invaluable lessons in foreign cultures,\" explains Hirsch.",
