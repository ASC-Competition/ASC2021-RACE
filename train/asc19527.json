  "article": "Mrs. Brown had a small garden behind her house and in the spring she planted some vegetables in it. She looked after them very carefully, and when the summer came, they looked very nice. One evening Mrs. Brown looked at her vegetables and said, \"Tomorrow I am going to pick them and we can eat them.\" But early the next morning, her son ran into the kitchen and shouted, \"Mother, mother! Come quickly! Our neighbor's ducks are in the garden and they are eating our vegetables!\" Mrs. Brown ran out, but it was too late. All the vegetables are finished! Mrs. Brown cried, and her neighbor was very sorry, but that was the end of the vegetables. Then a few days before Christmas, the neighbor brought Mrs. Brown a beautiful fat duck. And on it was a piece of paper with the words, \"ENJOY YOUR VEGETABLES!\"",
