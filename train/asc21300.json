  "article": "Mrs Brown was very fat. Her husband  thought she should go on a diet, and he made her eat no meat or cakes.\nOne morning, Mrs Brown made a nice cake for her husband, and he ate half  of it. After he went out, Mrs Brown cut a very small piece of the cake and ate it. It was very delicious. Then she cut a bigger piece and ate it, too. In a few minutes she finished up the cake. \"My husband is going to be very angry,\" she thought. \"What should I do?\" She made another cake very quickly, ate half of it, and put the other half on the table. Mr. Brown came back later. When he saw the half of the cake on the table, he was very happy.\n,. (5,2, 10)",
