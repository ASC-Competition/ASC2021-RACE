  "article": "The first day of school, our professor introduced an old lady Rose to us.\n\"Why are you in college at such an age?\" I asked her. She replied, \"I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!\" We became friends quickly.\nAt the end of the term I invited Rose to make a speech to our football team. I'll never forget what she taught us. She said, \"There are some secrets of staying young and being happy. You have to laugh and find humor every day. You must have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you will die. There is a huge difference between growing old and growing up. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't need any _ or ability. To grow up, you must always find the opportunity in change. Have no regrets. The people who are afraid of death are those with regrets.\"\nAt the end of the year, Rose finished her college. One week after graduation, Rose died peacefully in her sleep. We would always remember the great woman.",
