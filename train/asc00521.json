  "article": "When you close your eyes and try to think of the shape of your own body, what you imagine (or rather, what you feel) is quite different from what you see when you open your eyes and look in the mirror. The image you feel is much vaguer  than the one you see. And if you lie still, it is quite hard to imagine yourself as having any particular size or shape.\nWhen you move, when you feel the weight of your arms and legs and the natural resistance of the objects around you, the \"felt\" image of yourself starts to become clearer. It is almost as if it were created by your own actions and the feelings they cause.\nThe image you create for yourself has rather strange proportions ; certain parts feel much larger than they look. If you get a hole in one of your teeth, it feels enormous; you are often surprised by how small it looks when you inspect it in the mirror.\nAlthough the \"felt\" image may not have the shape you see in the mirror, it is much more important. It is the image through which you recognize your physical existence in the world. In spite of its strange proportions, it is all one piece, and since it has a consistent right and left and a top and bottom, it allows you to locate new feelings when they occur. It allows you to find your nose in the dark and point to a pain.\nIf the felt image is damaged for any reason--if it is cut in half or lost as it often is after certain strokes  which wipe out recognition of one entire side -these tasks become almost impossible. What is more, it becomes hard to make sense of one's own visual appearance. If one half of the \"felt\" image is wiped out or injured, the patient stops recognizing the affected part of his body. It is hard for him to find the location of feelings on that side, and, although he feels the doctor's touch, he locates it as being on the undamaged side.",
