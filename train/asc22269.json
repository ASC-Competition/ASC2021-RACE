We have been good friends for two years.\nJohn is tall and strong with black hair. He has a round face, a small nose and big, brown eyes. I like his eyes because they are always bright and smiling.\nJohn is always friendly and helpful. When I feel bored or unhappy, he tells me funny jokes and makes me laugh. He'll give me help when I need.\nJohn is very smart. He reads a lot of books. He is good at singing and acts very well. He would like to make people happy with his songs and performance when he grows up. I believe that he can become as popular as Jackie Chan and travel around the world in the future.",
