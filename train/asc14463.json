  "article": "The bus driver and his passengers were being hailed   as heroes last night after rescuing a woman from her burning car following a crash on the Bluff Highway. The 60-year-old woman was taken by ambulance to Southland Hospital after firefighters battled for 30 minutes to cut her from her car.\nActing Senior Sergeant Brock Davis of Invercargill, said emergency services were called to the scene of the crash at the crossroads of Motorimu Rd and State Highway I shortly before 5:00 p.m. yesterday.\nMr. Davis said a Mitsubishi car driven by a 30-year-old man traveling north on the highway and the woman's southbound   Suzuki Alto collided  . The man suffered slight injuries in the crash, he said.\nInvercargill Passenger Transport Ltd driver Bill McDermott and his passengers--New Zealand Aluminum Smelters Ltd workers were first on the scene and alerted emergency services. The scene at the spot was disordered, Mr. McDermott said.\n\"There was a car on its side and a guy wandering around who was quite excited,\" he said. \"We stopped, got out and found a lady trapped in her car ...... then we noticed flames in the engine bay and the smell of petrol.\" Mr. McDermott took a fire extinguisher  from the bus, doused   the flames, and several other workers controlled traffic.\nHowever, he said his actions were \"no big deal\". He was not willing to take any credit for helping the woman.\n\"The praise goes to all the guys that jumped off that bus.\" Invercargill Senior Station officer Alan Goldsworthy, who was an officer in charge at the scene, said there was a possibility the car could have burst into flames if Mr. McDermott and the smelter workers had not helped. \"They should acquire a good pat on the back.\" he said.",
