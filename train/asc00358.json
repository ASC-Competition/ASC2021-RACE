  "article": "A widow's wish to hear her late husband's voice again has pushed London's Subway system to restore a 40-year-old recording of the subway's famous \" Mind the gap\" announcement.\nThe underground, or the tube, first opened in 1863, tracked down the voice recording by Oswald Lawrence after his widow, Margaret McCollum, told them what it meant to her.\nMcCollum, 65, said she used to frequently visit Embankment tube station or plan her journeys around the stop to listen to Lawrence's voice, even before his death. She was _ in November when she noticed it had been replaced by a different voice.\n\"Lawrence was a drama school graduate when he auditioned   for a tour company. For six years after his death, I'd stay on the platform--just sit and listen to it again,\" she added.\nWhen Margaret approached the tube, she was told it had a new broadcast system and it couldn't use the old recording anymore.\nNigel Holness, director of London Underground, said its staff has been so moved by McCollum's story that they dug up the recording and gave the widow a copy of the announcement on a CD for her to keep. \"Tube staff is also working to restore Lawrence's announcement at the station,\" he added. \"It is celebrating its 150thanniversary this year. The tube's 'Mind the gap' messages, voiced by various actors, have accompanied countless London commuter journeys since the 1960s. Train drivers and staff made the warnings themselves before that.\"\n\"I'm very pleased that people are interested in Oswald's old recording,\" Margaret said. \"He was a great London transport user all his life .He would be amused, touched, and delighted to know he's back where he belonged.\"",
