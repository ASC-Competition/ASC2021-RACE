  "article": "From a college designed specifically for high school students to one that doesn't provide students with grades, here are some of the country's most unique institutions.\n*Berea College, Berea, Kentucky\nThe first interracial, co-educational college in the South, Berea specializes in attracting students who may be otherwise unable to afford a college education. Berea students come from families with an average household income of $30,000, which is why the school's financial aid program is so important.\n*Deep Springs College, Deep Springs, California\nDeep Springs, formerly an all-male school, has one of the smallest student bodies in the country at 26. The college accepts only 10% of its applicants, and maintains its own cattle herd. Students enjoy the school's isolated location -- 45 miles away from the nearest established town. Electricity is produced mainly through solar power, and the college sometimes even sells electricity to Pacific Gas & Electric.\n*The Evergreen State College, Olympia, Washington\nAt Evergreen, students don't receive traditional letter grades. Instead, professors issue narrative   evaluations of students' work at the end of each term. The curriculum is structured around the \"Coordinated Studies Program\", which focuses on providing students with a well-rounded education across a number of different areas. The college sits on 1,000 breathtaking acres, a portion of it on Puget Sound.\n*Hampshire College, Amherst, Massachusetts\nConsidered an \"experimenting\" college because of its constantly changing curriculum, Hampshire College doesn't feature a traditional grading system. Instead, the school requires students to complete three different divisions, which feature different classes. Once the project is completed, it's not given a grade, but a written evaluation, as other projects students complete throughout their time at Hampshire are.",
