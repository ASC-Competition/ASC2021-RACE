  "article": "The Chinese word\"Shanzhai\" means a small mountain village, but now it becomes an accepted name for fakes  after\" Shanzhai cell phones \" produced by small workshops in southern China ,became popular in the mainland market over the past few years.\nBesides\" Shanzhai\" electronic products, there are \"Shanzhai\" movies, \"Shanzhai\" stars and even a \"Shanzhai\" Spring Festival Gala, a copy of the 25-year-old traditional show presented by CCTV on Chinese Lunar New Year's Eve.\n\" Shanzhai\" has become a culture of its own,symbolizing anything that _ something famous.\nThe phenomenon has caused a public debate over whether it is healthy or sick being a copycat.\nIn southwestern China's Chongqing Municipality,a \"Shanzhai\" -version\"Bird's Nest\" woven by farmers with bamboo attracts wide attention and the\"Shanzhai\"-version \"Water Cube\"is popular with tourists too. Both are copies of the famous Olympics buildings in Beijing.\nXie Xizhang,a literature critic,said that taking the \"Shanzhai\" Gala as an example, when the traditional CCTV program becomes less and less attractive to the audience, the \"Shanzhai\" version appears naturally to attract people.\n\"In spite of its poor techniques and operation, 'Shanzhai' culture meets the psychological demands of common people and could be a comfort to their minds,\" Xie said.\nTian Huiqun,a professor at Beijing Normal University,said that \"Shanzhai\" culture never copies classic things,only trendy products. In that sense,it's like a computer virus, multiplying without meaning.\nThough controversial,\"Shanzhai\" culture is becoming a widely accepted phenomenon.\n\"To the mainstream culture, the rise of 'Shanzhai' culture is a challenge as well as a motivation,\" said Xie.\nTian said different kinds of cultures developing together is an ideal situation and it is for the public to choose.",
