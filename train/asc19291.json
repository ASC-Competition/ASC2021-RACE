According to the list, \"password\" is the worst and most common password. Many others on the list are numbers in order either forward (for example,1234) or backward. Letters on the keyboard in order, such as \"qwerty\" are also common, as well as some first names and animals. \"Hackers can easily break into many accounts  just by trying common passwords again and again, \" said Morgan Slain, CEO of Splash Data.\nHow can you make a strong password? It should be eight characters or more, with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. One way to create a long and easy-to-remember password is to separate short words with spaces or numbers.
