  "article": "Disposing   of waste has been a problem since humans started producing it. As more and more people choose to live close together in cities,the waste disposal problem becomes increasingly difficult.\nDuring the eighteenth century,it was usual for several neighboring towns to get together to select a faraway spot as a dump site. People would transport household rubbish,rotted wood and old possessions to the site. Regularly some of the trash was burned and the rest was buried. The unpleasant sights and smells caused no problem because nobody lived close by. Factories and some other industrial sites also had waste to be disposed of. Those located on rivers often just poured the unwanted remains into the water. Others built huge burners with chimneys to deal with the problem.\nSeveral facts make these choices unacceptable to modern society. The first problem is space. Dumps , are most needed in heavily populated areas. Such areas rarely have empty land suitable. Farm areas are refusing to accept rubbish from elsewhere,cheap land in major city areas to dispose wastes is nonexistent . Awareness of pollution dangers has resulted in more strict rules of waste disposal. Pollution of rivers,ground water,land and air is a price people can no longer pay to get rid of waste. The amount of waste,however, continues to grow.\nRecycling efforts have become commonplace,and many towns require their people to take part. Even the most efficient recycling programs,however,can hope to deal with only about 50 percent of a city's reusable waste,so more people should be involved in recycling programs.",
