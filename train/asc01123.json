  "article": "Mrs Young was eighty. Her husband died when she was fifty - three and he left her an old car he had had for six years. She learned to drive and loved very much. She liked driving very fast, and was proud of the fact that she had never been caught for a driving offence .\nThen one day she nearly lost her record . A police car followed her, and the policeman in it saw her pass a red light without stopping and she was taken before a judge. The man looked at her and said that she was too old to drive a car, and the reason why she had not stopped at the red light was most probably that her eyes had become weak with old age, so that she had simply not seen it.\nWhen the judge had finished what he was saying, Mrs Young opened her handbag she was carrying and took out her sewing. Without saying a word, she chose a needle  with a very small eye , and threaded it at her first try.\nWhen she had finished it, she took the thread out of the needle again and handed both the needle and the thread to the judge, saying, \"Now it's your turn. I suppose you drive a car, and that your eyesight is good.\"\nThe judge took the needle and tried to thread it. After trying six times, he had still not done it. At last he had to set the old woman free and her record remained unbroken.",
