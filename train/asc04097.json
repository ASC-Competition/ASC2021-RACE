  "article": "Many Americans spend more time in cars these days than in the kitchen. But as lives grow busier--and waistlines grow larger--a number of health experts are calling for Americans to reduce their risk of cancer and other diseases by cooking at home more and eating out less.\n\"When dining out, people are likely to _ all the wrong thing,\" says Rachel Brandeis of the American Dietetic Association. \"People take in 50% more fat and sodium when they eat out than when they cook at home. And they often miss out on fruits, vegetables and other vitamin-rich 'powerhouse foods' that may reduce the risk of cancer.\"\nNutritionists know it's not easy to break old habits. Many people say they hardly have time to exercise, let alone fix dinner.\nBrandeis says her secret is organization. She cooks six nights a week, even though she and her husband both work. She spends 20 minutes thinking about a week's worth of menus and writing a list. She shops just once a week. Brandeis says she chooses easy cooking methods, too. Since she is not quite good at cooking.\nThe American Institute for Cancer Research has produced a guide filled with tips like \"Homemade for Health\". Melanie Polk, the institute's director of nutrition education, says cooking at home has many advantages. It teaches children about nutrition as well as the importance of sharing housework.\nThe 39-year-old homemaker Kirstin Kristinus of Washington, D.C. says cooking at home brings her family together. She also tries to reduce her family's cancer risk by preparing every meal with many different kinds of food.\n\"The only way to know that you are getting all the good things is to expose yourself to a wide variety of food,\" says Steven Shiff, a doctor in New Jersey. \"If you eat out at a restaurant, it's a lot easier to choose unhealthful things.\"\nHowever, \"families don't have to give up restaurants,\" Shiff says. \"It is possible to eat healthfully if you eat outside the home. But it takes probably the same sort of planning that you would have to do to prepare meals at home.\"",
