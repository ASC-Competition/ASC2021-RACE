  "article": "Mistrust  _ Zhengzhou Ride-share Effort\nMore than 300 private car owners from a central Chinese city volunteered to offer free rides to citizens to ease crowded public transportation, but many local people didn't accept the offer for fear of being cheated.\nThe ride-share program was begun in October in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province, when Ye Zhantong, a private car driver, started to gather volunteers to offer the free service. The drivers tied a green silk ribbon  on the car to differentiate themselves from unlicensed taxi drivers. But the free rides haven't been popular among the public as increasing reports of dishonesty have dried up many local citizens' trust towards strangers.\nYe said some of the volunteers have dropped out after they felt their kind intention was being questioned. Passersby walking in heavy rainfall or passengers who missed a bus would remain silent and walk away when the volunteers would stop and offer a ride.\n\"It's so common that people give us the cold shoulder, and sometimes, take our kindness as ill will,\" said one of Ye's volunteers, identified as Binge. \"Many would even say: 'Let's get out of here quickly to avoid being cheated by him.'\" Some commenters on Weibo explained why they hesitated to participate in a ride-share program. \"Trusting a stranger might bring huge risks. I can't take the risk,\" one Internet user wrote.\nSome said Ye's group wasn't authorized, and cheaters pretending to be kind drivers might volunteer. They suggested traffic authorities issue rules to regulate, protect and promote ride-share programs.",
