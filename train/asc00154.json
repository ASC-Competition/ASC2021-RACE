  "article": "We all think that we know what happiness is. We all seem to be making great efforts towards this goal of happiness but what is it really? It is an agreed fact that all the creatures want happiness and are afraid of pain and sadness. The question, however, is \"what is real happiness?\" What really is called happiness? The desire for happiness has no meaning without understanding the real nature of happiness.\nSome thinkers say, \"Happiness does not lie in objects of enjoyment; happiness or unhappiness lies in imagination.\"\nTo prove their belief, they give examples like the following one: A man has a two-storey house; on the right is a five-storey building and on the left a cottage. When he sees right, he feels unhappy and when he sees left he feels happy. As such happiness does not lie in possession of sensory objects, but in imagination. They advise people to look towards those who have fewer possessions and be happy. If you look towards people having more wealth and possessions, you will always be unhappy.\nIt is unreasonable to hold this point of view. It is unkind to regard one happy by imagining that one is better than the poor and the unhappy. \"If you want to be happy, look towards the poor\". We know that those poor people cannot satisfy even their basic needs. This attitude satisfies the sense of pride of possessions, but this can never be called happiness.\nUnless we really find where happiness lies, we cannot really be happy.\nSome ask people to do this and do that and say, \"This way your desires would be satisfied. You would get the desired objects and become happy.\" People holding these views regard happiness as satisfaction of desires. But it is not possible to satisfy one's desires because there are countless desires of countless people and the material things are limited. Then new desires arise as soon as the previous ones are satisfied. Therefore, desires, which are changing all the time, can never be satisfied.\nHappiness is a characteristic of a good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills   human nature in an excellent way. People have a set of purposes which are typically human: these belong to our nature. Happiness is also a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated  , and defended privately by each person. People who learn to control inner experience will be able to determine the quality of their lives and come to being happy. Happiness lies in the distribution of easiness among others. Happiness stands for forgiveness and justice. Happiness is the name of struggle and courage. Happiness may be founded in seeking of true knowledge and rule of wisdom. Happiness may be shared in service and duty. This life is combination of joys and sorrows, and honest efforts should be done to make this life journey full of happiness, love, peace and harmony.",
