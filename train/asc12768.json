  "article": "One day a few years ago a very funny thing happened to a neighbor of mine. He is a teacher at one of London's big medical schools, He had finished his teaching for the summer term and was at the airport on his way to Russia to give a lecture.\nHe had put a few clothes and his lecture notes in his shoulder bag, but he had put Rupert, the skeleton   to be used in his lecture, in a large brown suitcase  . At the airport desk, he suddenly thought that he had forgotten to buy a newspaper. He left his suitcase near the desk and went over to the shop.\nWhen he got back he discovered that someone had taken his suitcase by mistake. He often wonders what they said when they got home and found Rupert.",
