  "article": "My favourite shop is called' Model World'. It is on the second floor of Happy Plaza, near to Pizza Club. It is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. every day.\nModel World' sells all kinds of models. It has model soldiers, cars, boats, airplanes, space shuttles and even dinosaurs. It has models for young children and models for adults  . Some models have just about twenty pieces, and others have over 2,000 pieces. You can also buy paints and glue   and other things there.\nThe staff at ' Model World' is very nice. They are very interested in making models. They will give you advice, and answer all of your questions. The prices are not low but they are not high. My best buy was a model of a helicopter. It cost $ 30 but it had over 400 pieces. It was really fun to make. If you are interested in models, you should visit this shop.",
