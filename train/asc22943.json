  "article": "An old woman went out shopping last Tuesday. She came to a bank and saw a car near the door. A young man with dark glasses got out of it and went into the bank. She looked into the car and found some keys in it.\nThe man took a gun out of his pocket and said to the man in the bank, \"Give me all the money.\" But the woman didn't see this. She went to the young man and put the keys in his hand, \"My boy,\" she said, \"Don't leave your keys in your car! Someone is going to steal  it.\"\nThe young man looked at the old woman for a few minutes. Then he took his keys, ran out of the bank, got into his car and drove away quickly without taking any money.",
