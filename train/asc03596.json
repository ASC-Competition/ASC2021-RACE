Friends are _ who will have a great time with you all the time.\nEven if you can't get together with your friends you can usually get a hold of them by phone, email or text messaging. Conversation is another value which people consider with regard to friendship. Everyone needs to talk and share their thoughts and feelings and friends are great in providing this for you.\nFriends also lend a helping hand when it is needed. Every once in a while you will find that you have a problem which your friends can often help you out with. Whether it deals with a fight with your parents or other problems, your friends are there for you. This is an important trait   when it comes to friendship.\nThose who have good friends will also find that laughter   is a big part of the relationship. No one can make you laugh like your friends and laughter is so good for keeping your spirits up and making your day bright. You will find that the more good friends you have, the more laughter and happiness you will have in your life. Just keep in mind, though, that it is often quality   of friends and not quantity of friends which make a person happy.",
