  "article": "Asia-Pacific consumers are the world's largest group of online shopping lovers and many rely on Internet reviews when making purchases, research firm Nielsen said this week.\nThe firm said 35% of consumers in Asia-Pacific used over 11% of their monthly spending to make online purchases, compared to a global average of 27% of consumers.\nSouth Koreans were the heaviest online buyers in Asia, with 59% directing more than 11% of their monthly spending to online purchases, followed by 41% in China, Nielsen said in a report.\nA further 31% of Asian consumers use between 6% and 10% of their monthly shopping purchases to buy items online.\nMore Asia-pacific consumers also intend to buy online in the next six months than those from other regions, with South Koreans and Chinese the most likely to make such purchases.\nAmong the purchases consumers in the region are likely to make in the next six months are books, clothing, shoes, airline tickets, electronic equipment and hotel reservations.\n\"Technology and the Internet will very likely basically change how and where shoppers spend their money and interact with sellers,\" said Pete Gale, a managing director at Nielsen's Retailer Services.\n\"We are seeing a strong trend in markets like Korea, where a significant population of online shoppers buy essentials such as groceries, cosmetics and nutrition supplies over the Internet.\"\nNielsen said opinions posted online were important in Asia-pacific customers' decisions to buy products such as cosmetics, cars, software and food.\nAsia-pacific consumers were also the most likely to share dissatisfaction at a product on the Internet compared with consumers elsewhere.\n\"The increasing accessibility of the Internet and unbelievable popularity of social media and online discussion forums mean today's brands have nowhere to hide, \" said Megan Clarken, Asia-Pacific managing director at Nielsen's online division.\nNielsen said in June that social media such as Facebook and Twitter or blogging sites had become powerful tools influencing what people buy and urged businesses to embrace the trend.",
