  "article": "Neumann was the oldest of 3 children of a banker, and his speed of learning new ideas and of solving problems stood out early.At 17, his father tried to persuade him not to become a mathematician because he may lead a poor life being a mathematician, and so Neumann agreed to study chemistry as well.In 1926, at 23, he received a degree in chemical engineering and a Ph.D.in mathematics.From then on, mathematic provided well enough for him, and he never had to turn to chemistry.\nIn 1930, Neumann visited Princeton University for a year and then became a professor there.His first book was published in 1932.In 1933, the Institute for Advanced Study was formed, and he became one of the 6 full-time people in the School of Mathematics (Einstein was one of the others).\nWorld War II hugely changed Neumann's areas of interest.Until 1940 he had been a great pure   mathematician.During and after the war, he became one of the best mathematicians who put mathematics theories into practice.During the last part of the war he became interested in computing machines and made several contributions.After the war, Neumann continued his work with computers, and was generally very active in government service.He received many awards, was president of American Mathematical Society and was a member of the Atomic Energy Commission.He died in 1957 of cancer.\nNeumann really was a legend  in his own time, and there are a number of stories about him.His driving ability is a part of this legend.He reported one accident this way: \"I was driving down the road.The trees on the right were passing me in an orderly fashion at 60 miles per hour.Suddenly one of them stepped in my path.\"",
