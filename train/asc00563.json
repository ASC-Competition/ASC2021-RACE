  "article": "Mr. Brown worked in a factory of a small town. He had been there for twenty years before one day he was sent to the capital for important business. He was quite excited because he had never been there before. Before he set off, he asked his wife and three daughters if they wanted him to buy something for them in London. Mrs. Brown began to think it over and then she said she wished her husband would be able to buy a nice umbrella for her, and so did their three daughters. As he was afraid he would forget it, he drew an umbrella on his hand. To his regret, he lost _ at the station.\nOn the train Mr. Brown sat opposite to an old woman. The woman's umbrella was so nice that he carefully looked at it and said to himself not to forget to buy a few umbrellas like it. When the train arrived at the station in London, he said good-bye to the old woman, took his bag and her umbrella and was going to get off.\n\"Wait a minute, sir,\" shouted the old woman. \"That's my umbrella!\"\nNow Mr. Brown noticed that he had taken her umbrella. His face turned red at once and said in a hurry,\"Oh, I'm very sorry, Madam! I didn't mean it!\"\nSeven days later Mr. Brown left the capital. To his surprise, he met the old woman and sat opposite to her again. Looking at the four umbrellas, the old woman was satisfied with herself. \"It seems that I had a better choice than the other four women.\" She thought.",
