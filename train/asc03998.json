  "article": "The forest in Senegal, a country in western Africa, is full of the chimps' usual noises. Suddenly dogs bark. Larger male chimps drop from the trees to face the threat while the others climb to safety. Then the dogs' young human masters appear.\nOne mother chimp with a tiny baby tries to run. The dogs attack and separate them. The two teenage boys quickly catch the baby chimp. But they don't act out of sympathy --- they save the baby so they can sell it.\nAfter the teenagers return to their hometown, they visit a man who is said to be very interested in chimps. When they ask the man, Johnny Kante, if he wants to buy the baby, he replies, \"That's not what we do.\" Kante is a member of a scientific team. Although Kante is angry with the teens for capturing the chimp, he hides his anger and persuades them to take him to the baby chimp.\nUnsure of what to do next upon seeing the chimp, Kante calls Jill Pruetz, the head of the chimp research team. \"I'm really worried,\" says Pruetz, doubtful that the mother is still alive. But knowing that wild chimps sometimes adopt orphans , Kante and pruetz decide they must try to return the baby chimp to its wild community.\nKante pays another visit to the teenagers. After he explains how much trouble they are in, because chimps are an endangered species, he requests they should give him the frightened baby without payment. They agree. Kante takes the baby chimp to his home and feeds her milk from a bottle whenever she cries.\nThe next morning, Pruetz and Kante leave the baby with another team member and begin their search for the wild chimps. Pruetz quickly finds the group in the woods. She recognizes the female that is without her child.\nPruetz is so excited that she runs the entire mile back to bring the baby chimp to the tree where the chimps are hanging out. The researchers place the baby on the ground near the tree and back away. Almost immediately, a male chimp drops to the ground and stares at the baby curiously. He carries her back to where the mother is waiting.\nPruetz still can't believe how fortunate they were to have reunited the mother and child. \"Surprising is the only word I can think of,\" she says.",
