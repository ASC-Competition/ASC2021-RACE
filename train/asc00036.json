  "article": "The world has a fast growing population and people need more land for houses, factories, highways, and so on. The farmland is decreasing with each passing day. How to meet the need of feeding the growing population? One way is to introduce some high-output gene into a crop to enable it to produce more. Biologists over the years have discovered genes which can raise output of the crops, resist pests, improve taste, etc.\nHowever, in many western countries there is widespread concern over the safety of\"Genetically Modified\"(GM)   foods, because they think there may be serious problems of environment, health, safety, morality and so on.\nAs a scientist I must admit GM foods involve great risks to humans. In fact in Europe they're called \"Frankenstein foods\" by many. Frankenstein is a character in a novel. He was a very clever scientist. He created a monster , which eventually killed him.\nSoybeans can be made into many foods. However, it's hard to _ . Therefore, it's very important we have to make sure the soybean, if genetically modified, is free from any poisonous matter harmful to human beings. For this we need very good testing. We do have some testing on some animals, but no completely satisfactory testing has ever been made so far. They're entirely new, and their problems are entirely unknown. It takes time to develop persuasive tests to know whether they're harmful to us or not.\nWe may not be able to tell what may happen if we take GM foods. Some of them may be resistant to antibiotics  . Then many of the medicines we have today will have no effect on people eating GM foods.\nA more likely case is the GM foods may contain genes some people are allergic to.\nGM products have already come into our lives but most people even know nothing about it.\nAt least we have to be clear about what we are eating. The China Consumers Association is calling for labeling   on GM foods so that consumers will know before they buy them.",
