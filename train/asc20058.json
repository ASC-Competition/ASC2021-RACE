  "article": "The clock struck  eleven at night. The whole house was quiet. Everyone was in bed except me. Under the strong light, I looked sadly at a huge pile  of those trouble things\n--books.\nI was going to have my exam the next day. \"When can I go to bed?\" I asked myself. I didn't answer. And I could not. The clock struck twelve. \"Oh, dear! Ten more books to read before I go to bed!\" We students are the most wretched ones in the world. Dad does not agree with me on this. He did not have to work so hard when he was a boy.\nThe clock struck one. I was quite hopeless now. I forgot all I did learn. I was too tired to go on. I did the only thing I could. I prayed , \"My god, please let me pass the exam tomorrow. I will work hard next time, Amen.\" My eyes were so heavy that I could hardly open them. A few minutes later, with my head on the books, I fell asleep.",
