  "article": "A new weapon is on the way in the fight against smoking in Europe. Soon when smokers buy cigarettes they might see a shocking photo of a blackened lung or a cancer patient staring back at them from the packet.\nSome boys may think of smoking as cool and sexy. Their friends won't agree when they see their packets of cigarettes lying on the table. The European Union announced on October 22, that it had chosen 42 photos that showed the damage cigarettes could do to the body. It called on member nations to put these pictures on packets to discourage smokers. To catch the attention of teenagers, the special packets warn of long-term medical dangers, like cancer. Short-term effects, like bad skin, are also on the list.\n\"The true face of smoking is disease, death and horror. That is the message we should send to the young,\" said David Byrne, an EU health official. \"Hopefully these pictures will shock students out of their love for cigarettes.\"[:ZSSxxSSk.Com]\nThe EU head office hoped the pictures would work better than current written warnings on packs of cigarettes. The warnings included \"smoking kills\" and \"smoking can lead to a slow and painful death.\"\nSo far, Ireland and Belgium have shown interest in the photos. Canada has used similar pictures and warnings on cigarette packs since 2000. The country has recently seen a fall in the number of smokers. According to studies, smoking is the single biggest cause of avoidable death in EU. Every year more than 650,000 smokers die, more than one person a minute.",
