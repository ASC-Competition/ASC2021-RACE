  "article": "Lucy Brown teaches English in a junior high school. She loves her students very much, and she works hard. She often tells them some interesting stories in class and her students like her, too.\nYesterday, Lucy found some boys always made faces in class. She didn't want them to do that again, so she got all her students together and said, \"Boys and girls, when I was young, I liked making faces in class, too. But one day, my grandmother told me not to do that again. She said, 'If you make faces again, you will be ugly when you grow up.' So you shouldn't do that again.\"\nSome students thought she was right, but some students didn't. One of the boys put up his hand. \"Oh, Tom! What do you want to say?\" asked Lucy.\nThe boy stood up and said, \"Miss Brown, you must regret listening to your grandmother now.\"",
