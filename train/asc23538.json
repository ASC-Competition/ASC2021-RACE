Or you go to the same restaurant every day and the owner always says \"Hello\" to you but you can never remember her name. If this happens, you are _ -- actually most people have the problem remembering names.\nHere are some ways that can help people remember names.\n* Repeat the person's name loud at least three times while you talk together. For example, instead of saying \"Nice to meet you.\" say \"Nice to meet you, Jack.\" Instead of saying \"Where do you live?\" you can say \"Where do you live, Jack?\"\n*Introduce the person by name to someone else right away.\n* Write the name down as soon as possible.\nThere are other ways which may seem a little strange. However, try them.\n* Think of a story using the person's name. For example, think to yourself, \"Jack has a nice jacket.\" Imagine Jack in a nice jacket.\n* Think of a rhyme for the person's name. For example, think to yourself, \"Jack would look nice in black.\" Imagine Jack wearing black clothes.\nAll these ways have one thing in common. You must pay attention to the people you meet. You can't just meet someone, nod your head, say hello, and walk away. Remembering names takes work and practice.",
