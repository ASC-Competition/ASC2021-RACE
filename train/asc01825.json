  "article": "Robinson Crusoe is a famous novel written by Daniel Defoe. The book tells the story of a man who is shipwrecked  . He spends 28 years on an island near Venezuela. The book tells the story of everything that happens to Robinson Crusoe. He hopes someone will rescue him, but he has been there for so long on his own that he also begins to fear being rescued.\nRobinson Crusoe was published in 1719. Most experts believe the story is based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, who was a Scottish sailor. On an expedition   in 1704, Selkirk had an argument with his ship's captain. Selkirk thought the ship was not safe and was about to fall apart.\nWhen the ship stopped at a remote island to get fresh water, Selkirk got off. He tried to get the other crew members to leave with him, but nobody would. The shop then sailed away without him. Selkirk spent four years and four months on his own on the island, known as Aguas Buenas.\nSelkirk was finally rescued by a ship that visited the island in 1709. The ship's captain was grateful to Selkirk because he provided food for the crew when they arrived.\nNow archaeologists think they have found the remains of Selkirk's camp on Aguas Buenas. They found two deep holes that would have held wooden posts. The archaeologists say this is evidence that Selkirk built a shelter there. The post holes are near a fresh water stream. They are located quite high up, which would have meant that Selkirk was able to watch out for the ships coming close to the island.\nThe most interesting evidence, the archaeologists say, is part of a piece of equipment used by sailors to navigate  . Historians believe Selkirk was a navigator, so the instrument could have belonged to him.\nRobinson Crusoe was published ten years after Selkirk was rescued. Most experts think Daniel Defoe heard and read stories about Selkirk, which inspired him to write the book.",
