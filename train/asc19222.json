  "article": "Tom gets up at half past seven in the morning. He has an egg and some milk for his breakfast. Then he begins to go to school slowly. When he is on his way to school, he thinks, \"I tell my teacher my mother is ill on Monday morning. I tell him my bike is wrong on Tuesday. What do I tell my teacher today?\"\nTom thinks over but he doesn't find a good idea before he gets to school.\"May I come in?\" Tom shouts at the door of the classroom.\n\" Oh, my boy,\" says Mr Green. \" Please look at the clock on the wall. What time is it now?\"\n\" It's ten past eight,\" answers Tom.\nMr Green is not happy. \" You are late for class three times this week. If all the students are like you, the clock is no use, I think.\"\n\" You are right, Mr Green,\" says Tom. \" If we don't have the clock, how do you know I am late for class?\"",
