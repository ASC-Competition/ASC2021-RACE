  "article": "All the cities are quite the same. Living in a modern Australian city is not very different from living in an American city. But there are some differences on farms.\nIn many parts of the world, farmers and their families live in villages or towns. In the United States, each farm family lives in its own fields. Usually their neighbours live far away. It's hard for them to see each other on weekdays. Their children take school buses to the nearest schools. These schools are only for the farm families in this area. In some areas, there are small schools for a few farm families, and the children walk to schools.\nLife keeps changing for everyone, so do farmers. Today there are cars, good roads, radios, television sets and there are modern machines for farming. All of these are changing farm life.",
