  "article": "(Q =\" Question;\" A = Answer)\nSituation I\nQ: If someone sits right next to me in an empty movie theater, is it rude to move?\nA: Maybe, but nobody will fault you for it. Chances are that the close sitter doesn't realize he disturbs you, so he may miss your annoyance. You undoubtedly aren't the first person he's met who needs enough room. Forgive his bad judgment, move quietly and enjoy the show.\nSituation II\nQ: If I use the bathroom at a store, do I need to buy something?\nA: Consider frequency and urgency. Is this a one-time thing or an emergency? If so, you don't have to buy anything, but it would be kind if you did. However, if you regularly use the bathroom at this place, then you are a customer, and you should act like one.\nSituation III\nQ: If someone is talking loudly on the bus, is there a nice way to ask him to keep it down?\nA: No. Try other means: 1) Stare at him until he gets aware of it and quiets down. 2) Lift your finger in a silence motion  and smile. 3) Put on earphones and ignore him.\nSituation IV\nQ: If I remember my friend's birthday a day late, should I apologize or just wish her a happy birthday like nothing happened?\nA: This is the reason why the word _ was invented. \"Happy belated birthday!\" is short for: \"Well, I know I forgot, but then I remembered. Forgive me and happy birthday.\"\nSituation V\nQ: Can I lie about seeing a text because I was loo busy or lazy to respond to it?\nA: Don't lie. Receiving a text does not mean you need to respond  to it. Why waste a perfectly good lie when the truth will serve? \"Yes,\" you can say if ever asked, \"I saw it.\" No explanation is needed as to why you don't respond.",
