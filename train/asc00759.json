  "article": "Could a grizzly bear move to your neighborhood? If you live in the U.S. West, the answer may be yes. People and grizzly bears are living closer together now.\nThe grizzly bear is one of the largest meat-eating land animals in North America. In the early 1800s, about 50,000 grizzly bears lived there. Today there're far fewer bears. Settlers built cities and roads where bears lived. Many bears were hunted and killed. Now only 1,200 to 1,400 grizzly bears have remained.\nIn and around Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears have been making a comeback because of people's efforts to protect them. Some bears are moving to areas where people live. People are also moving into grizzly countries.\nPeople there have to learn how to live with their new, furry   neighbors peacefully. If someone leaves their barbecue grill out overnight, or leaves their pet food or rubbish where a bear can get it, the bear will learn to come to their house for food. Grizzly bears that learn to eat people's food can become dangerous, and they often have to be killed or moved. Also, it's important not to surprise a grizzly. Besides, if you are hiking in a grizzly country, you should go with others and make a noise to make bears hear your coming and get out of the way. You may not want to invite grizzly bears to your next neighborhood party, but with a little effort, grizzly bears and people can live together peacefully.",
