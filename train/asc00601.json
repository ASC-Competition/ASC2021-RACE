  "article": "Cursive  writing is about to become extinct.Do we raise the red flag? To teach or not to teach cursive writing is a question that several state education departments are meeting with.\nBefore you read this text, do a simple exercise.Pick a pen and paper and start writing in cursive.Yes, that fancy handwriting that you learned in grade school.You may not have forgotten the good times you had while writing curly  Ms and Ns.However, the chances are that you won't be able to write it as excellently as you used to.Some people are good at making the perfect curls, while some are bad.I am still terrible at it.\nCursive writing is hardly used by kids anymore as even adults don't write in this style, unless they are using it for their signature.Learning it was a usual practice in school for several decades.However, in 2011, the Indiana Department of Education made it optional  for schools to teach cursive writing to the students.In fact, there are 46 more states that have also done the same.\nThere are some who believe that it is high time for cursive writing to retire from school curriculum.After all, if we don't leave the past behind, we cannot make way for new things.If you walk into any classroom, you would find children using keyboards to communicate in the written form.On the other hand, fans of cursive writing insist on its usefulness.They remind us that if we stop teaching and learning cursive writing in school, very soon most of our historical documents will become hard to us.Where do we stand on this subject? Is it the right time to erase an almost forgotten writing style and live in the keyboarding world? Or can we do both without compromising on our school curriculum? Let me know your thoughts on this matter by leaving a comment in the section below.",
