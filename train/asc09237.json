Some northern areas of the country have deserts while the southern part has tropical   rain forest.\n    Their capital city is Khartoum. At Khartoum the Blue Nile and the White Nile come together to form the Nile River, which is the world's longest river. Khartoum has about four hundred and seventy thousand people.\nThere are two groups of people who live in Sudan. In the northern part of the country, there are many Arabic-speaking Muslims. They make up about two-thirds of the total population. In the southern area, there are groups of people who speak African languages.\nThe northern and southern areas also have different histories. People in the south lived by themselves for many years. However, the northern area was controlled by foreigners for several centuries. After the World War II, Sudan became completely independent.",
