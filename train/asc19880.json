  "article": "Steven drives a school bus, but his bus isn't the same as other school buses because there aren't any children on it. There are only dogs. Steven's bus takes dogs to school at 8:00 in the morning and brings them back home at 5:30 in the afternoon. Steven takes the dogs to a dog school. There he teaches the dogs to do many things: sit down, stand up, bring the shoes to the master, keep the master from danger  . Many dogs go to Steven's school--big dogs, small dogs, old dogs, young dogs. Steven says that young dogs can learn more quickly.",
