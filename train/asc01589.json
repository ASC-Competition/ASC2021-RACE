  "article": "I'm sure you know the song \"Happy Birthday\". But do you know who wrote the song and for whom it was written?\nThe retired professor, Archibald A. Hill in Lucasville, USA could tell us the story. Ninety-seven years ago, two of Mr. Archibald Hill's aunts, Miss Patty Hill and Miss Mildred Hill were asked to write some songs for a book called \"Song Storied for the Sunday Morning\". Miss Patty Hill and Miss Mildred Hill were both kindergarten teachers then. They loved children very much and wrote many beautiful songs for the book. One of them was the famous \"Good Morning to You.\" The song said, \"Good morning to you, good morning to you,  children, good morning to all.\" This song was very popular at that time among kindergarten children. But not many grown-ups knew it. A few years later little Archibald was born. As his aunt, Miss Patty Hill sang the song \"Happy Birthday\" to the melody  of \"Good Morning to you\" to her little nephew . She sang the song like this: Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, Archie! Happy birthday to you!\nMiss Patty Hill and her sister had never expected that this song would become so popular, but it really did. People all over the world like the song because of its simplicity in tune  and friendliness in words.",
