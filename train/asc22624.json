  "article": "Most people think talking is the most important communication skill.They care little about listening.A research about our waking day communicating time shows that 9% is spent writing, 16% reading, 30% talking and 45% listening.\nMany of us can remember only 50% immediately after hearing something.But within two to eight weeks, we can only remember 25% or less of the message.Sometimes it will make us fail if we really forget something important.\nHere are some suggestions to be a good listener.\nStop talking -- you can't listen well when you speak.\nAsk questions -- when you don't understand, when you want to catch their attention or when you want to be liked.\nBe polite -- give them time to say what they have to say.\nListen carefully and actively to what they are saying -- pay attention to their words, their ideas and their feelings as those things relate to the subjects.\nUnderstand the main points.\nLook at each other -- you will feel confident by looking.\nDon't argue with other people when you are trying to understand them, especially when they are speaking.\nTry not to bring your worries and problems -- when you listen, they will stop you from listening well.\nLearn to listen and you'll achieve a great success in your life.",
