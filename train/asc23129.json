  "article": "A driver stopped his car on a street side to have a rest.As he lay down in the seat and closed his eyes, a person came up and knocked at the window to ask the time. The driver opened his eyes and looked at his watch. \"It's five past eight.\" he said. Then he went to sleep again. But soon he was waken up again because a second person was knocking at the window.\"Excuse me, what time is it now?\"he asked. The driver looked at his watch again, and told him it was half past eight.\nIn this way, the driver thought he couldn't have a good rest, so he wrote a short note and stuck  it on the window for all to see. It said,\"I don't know the time.\"Again, he lay down in the seat for his sleep. A few minutes later,a third person came and began to knock at the window, \"Hey,  sir.\"he said, \"It's a quarter to nine.\"",
