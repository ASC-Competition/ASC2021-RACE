  "article": "For most kids, height isn't something they can change, so what do you do if you don't like how tall or short you are? It might be girls feeling too tall and boys feeling too short but some really tall boys might not like all that height and some shorter girls might get tired of all the jokes or of feeling like they're staying little while their friends are growing up.\nIf you are still worried about your height, talk to your parents and your doctor. Most kids don't have a growth problem that needs help from a doctor, but it's always OK to ask if you're concerned.\nSo for most kids, it seems like there's not much to do but wait to see how it all turns out. But you can do something right now: eat healthy and take care of yourself. If you get the nutrition , sleep, and exercise you need, you're likely to reach your maximum height. In other words, you'll grow as tall as you were meant to grow.\nAnd even though you may hear people say it, taking extra vitamins or supplements  that you can buy in a store won't help you get taller. Just stick to a healthy diet if you want to be the tallest you can be!\nKids who wish they weren't so tall should still eat healthy and take care of themselves, of course. Eating less won't make you end up any shorter unless you really starved yourself and made yourself sick.\nAs they get older, most kids learn to feel comfortable with their height, whether they turn out tall, short, or somewhere in between.",
