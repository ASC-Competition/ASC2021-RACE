  "article": "Has a doctor ever given you a note to take to the chemist for some medicine? Are you able to read the note easily? Some doctors write clearly , but most doctors do not. Chemists  have more chances to read doctors' notes, but sometimes doctors write so badly that even the chemist can't read them.\nOne day a lady wrote to a doctor inviting him to have dinner at her house. The doctor wrote an answer, but he didn't write clearly and the lady couldn't read it.\n\"What shall I do?\" she said to her husband, \"I don't know whether he is coming or not. I don't want to give him a telephone call and say that I can't read his writing.\"\nHer husband thought a moment, then he had an idea.\n\"Thank you,\" said his wife. \"That's a very good idea.\"\nShe went to the chemist's shop and gave the doctor's note to the chemist. The chemist looked at it very carefully. Then he said politely, \"Could you wait a moment, madam?\" He went to the back of the shop. After a few minutes he returned carrying a large bottle. He gave the bottle to the lady and said, \"Three times a day and one spoonful at a time.\"",
