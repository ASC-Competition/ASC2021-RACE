  "article": "Dear editor,\nI live in a beautiful city. Many visitors come to my city every year because there are so many colorful peacocks   here.\nThe peacocks mostly live on the grassland of Dongfeng Square. Visitors usually throw food to them, but they don't think about at all whether the food is good or not. Some of the peacocks became ill, and some even died eating the bad food given by visitors.\nI'm sure most of the visitors who throw food to the peacocks really like the bird, but they don't realize that they may be doing them harm  . Visitors should be told that what they have done is harmful to the birds, and this kind of thing must be stopped.\nPerhaps we can build some small shops beside Dongfeng Square to sell peacock food. For us every person, it is our duty to give more love to these beautiful birds to look after them carefully.\nYours,\nWang Yang",
