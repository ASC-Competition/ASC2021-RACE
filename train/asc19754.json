Whenever they go for a walk or for a drive in the car and pass somebody, his uncle waves to the passer-by. Peter is surprised and says, \"Uncle Georage, you seem to know everybody here. Where did you meet them all?\"\n\"I don't know all these people.\" answers his uncle. \"Then why do you wave to them?\" \"Well, Peter ,\" says his uncle \"When I wave to someone who knows me, he is pleased. He goes on his journey with a happier heart. But when I wave to someone who doesn't know me , he is surprised and says to himself, ' Who is that man? Why did he wave to me?' So he has something to think about during the rest of his journey, and that makes his journey seem shorter.So.I.make.everybody.happy.",
