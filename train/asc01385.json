  "article": "A few years ago, when I was still in high school, I met a wonderful and warm teacher. At that time in my life, there were many changes to adjust to, apart from the usual teenage troubles. My parents had divorced, so my elder brother and I had chosen to stay with my dad. Due to the fact that he was keeping the house, we didn't have to move.\nDuring this time, my teacher took a special interest in me. Being my English teacher, she encouraged my mind to travel to creativity I had long given up. She brought me out of the shell I built.\nShe became my mother, my older sister, my friend and my teacher. The one thing she couldn't do though was to make me more girly as growing up with only my dad and brother made me a real tomboy.\nSometimes, I would be really immature , especially if she was scoring me less than others on purpose. She knew I could do better than what I was handing in and so pushed me to extend further than limits.\nWhen I finished school and then after college I was about to leave my hometowns she gifted me a watch that every second, with my pulse, should remind me of the one person who will forever wait and love me without reservation.\nTime has passed and our friendship is distant, but in my heart, soul and mind, she is the closest I ever got.",
