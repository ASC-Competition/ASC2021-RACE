  "article": "In western countries, especially in America, some social customs have lasted still today. For example, ladies first, that is to say, women in those countries are respected  in many ways.\nIn the U.S. and Europe, you will see men usually open doors for women and women generally walk ahead of men into a room or a restaurant unless the man have to be ahead of the ladies to choose the table, to open the door of a car or to give other services. On the street, men almost walk or across the street on the side of the ladies which is closer to traffic, but if a man walks with two ladies, he should walk between them.",
