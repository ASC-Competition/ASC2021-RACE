  "article": "Campers Gene and Marie Marsden took pride in being good citizens when in the wild. While driving miles to the Green River Lakes area, they taught their children what they had learned in the bear safety handbook put out by the Bridger-Teton Forest Service.\nMr. and Mrs. Marsden did their best to keep a tidy camp. As the handbook had said to hang all food at least ten feet off the ground and four feet out from the trees, they did that and locked their food in their trailer  at night. It was already dark when they went to bed, but they _ the campsite with flashlights, making sure nothing was left out. Following the bear book's advice, they slept a hundred yards from where they cooked their food, and kept the car near their tents, separated from the trailer, which they left up at the other camp.\nThe Marsdens liked having their dog Spike on guard. But on the first night, Spike would not stop barking. When Marie Marsden pulled the tent open and shone her flashlight, she saw a young bear.\nThey all piled into the car and drove quickly down the path, calling out of the window to Spike and abandoning the trailer. They drove to a pay phone and called a Fish and Game Department guard, who identified the bear by the white ring of the fur the Marsdens had seen around his neck. The authorities informed the Marsdens that the bear was a young male that they'd been keeping an eye on.\nThe next morning, the Marsdens heard helicopters circling over the mountain and wondered if it might have something to do with the bear.\nAfter spending the night in the public campground, they drove back to their site. Wandering the area in search of clues, Marie came to a stop below a tall tree. She slapped her head and shouted, \"Oh no!\"\n\"What is it?\" Gene asked.\nMarie pointed at the ground where Spike's dog food bowl lay upside down.\nA week after their return home, the Marsdens read the headline in their local paper. \"Bear Killed in Wind Rivers.\" According to the article, the Fish and Game Department had shot the young bear because, having been rewarded for invading  a human campsite, it would likely to do so again.\nThe Marsdens knew they had been lucky in the encounter, yet much to their shame and sadness, they also knew that the bear had not.",
