  "article": "If you have a chance to go to school in prefix = st1 /America, you should keep the following in mind:\n*If a teacher asks you a question, you are expected to give an answer. If you do not understand the question, you should raise your hand and ask the teacher to repeat the question. It is all right to tell the teacher that you do not know the answer. Then he or she knows what you need to learn.\n*There is no excuse for not doing your homework. If you are absent ,you should call your teacher or your classmates and ask for the assignment. It is your responsibility to find out what homework you have missed.\n*It is impolite to eat, drink or chew gum during class. This is allowed for the break. Removing one' s shoes in the classroom is also not polite.\n*You must not be absent on a test day. If you are seriously ill, you must call and let the teacher know you will not be there for the test. If your teacher allows a make-up test, you should take the test within one or two days after returning to class.\n*It is rude to be late. If you must come in late, be sure to do it quietly by having your books and papers out of your bag, then go to your seat and sit very quietly. In the U. S., it is not necessary to knock before you enter the classroom. Most teachers will give you a low grade if you are often late.\n*Copying another student' s test or paper is never acceptable. It is called cheating. Students who cheat are kicked out in most schools.",
