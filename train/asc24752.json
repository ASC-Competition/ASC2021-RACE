  "article": "In the bushes of Northern Africa, a baby lies warm and safe in a cave . He lies among baby wolves , next to Mother Wolf, and he is not afraid. Outside the cave, Shere Khan, the man-eating tiger, shouts angrily, wanting to kill. \"No!\" says Mother Wolf. \"He belongs to me. He will live to run with the other wolves and be like my son. And I will call him Mowgli.\"\nThe years pass, and Mowgli--the man's baby, grows up with the wolves. He learns the Law of the Jungle  from his teachers, Baloo, an old brown bear and Bagheera, a white elephant. He has many adventures , and many friends among the animals of the jungle. But he still has an enemy. Shere Khan the tiger has not forgotten him. He waits for the day when he can catch the man's child--and kill him.\nIf you want to know more about the story, just read The Jungle Book!",
