  "article": "He is only 12 years old but Utkarsh Tripathi brings out a handwritten newspaper every week on matters like the environment. He does all this to satisfy his wish to \"serve the country\". A Class 8 student of the Brij Bihari Sahai Inter College in Allahabad, Utkarsh has been bringing out the newspaper Jagriti for the last one year. And for the four-page, black-and-white newspaper, Utkarsh not only takes the role of a reporter, editor and publisher, but also gives it free of charge.\nJagriti has about 150 readers belonging to various age groups in Allahabad, some 200 km from the state capital Lucknow. \"Children make up major Jagriti readers ... my school friends, my seniors in school, teachers and also my neighbours,\" he said.\nAccording to Utkarsh's father Hari Prasad, who runs a coaching institute, his son has a gift for writing and wants to serve the country in some way.\n\"More than two years ago, he began to read articles in Hindi Daily. One day he said that he wanted to start serving society from his school life itself. I then suggested why not work like a journalist and make people know their rights,\" he added. Utkarsh took the suggestion seriously and came up with Jagriti. \"I try to cover social issues about environment, women foeticide and others in the editorial section, and also information about public welfare plans and important government policies for the betterment of the poor or children.\" Utkarsh said.\nJagriti also has successful stories of scientists, political leaders and other outstanding people.But how does he get time from his studies to bring out a weekly newspaper? \"I believe if anyone is passionate about something, he or she can take out some time to realize his dream.\" Utkarsh replied.\nUtkarsh's efforts are much appreciated by people in Allahabad. Nutan Devi, a local journalist, said, \"For me it's real journalism ...It has renewed the objective   of journalism that seems to have now got lost somewhere.\"",
