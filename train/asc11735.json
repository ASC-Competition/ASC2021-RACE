  "article": "One day, a teacher asked her students to list the names of their classmates on two pieces of paper, leaving a space after each name. Then she told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of them. That Saturday, the teacher wrote down the names and the words of each student on a separate piece of paper. On Monday she gave each student the list.\n   Before long, the students were smiling. \"I never knew that I meant anything to anyone! And I didn't know others liked me so much.\" most students said. No one ever mentioned anything about the paper in class again, but it didn't matter. The students were happy with themselves and one another. \nSeveral years later, one of the students, Mike would graduate from Harvard University and his teacher and some former classmates attended the commencement .\nMike came up to her. \"I want to show you something,\" he said, taking a wallet out of his pocket. He carefully took out two pieces of notebook paper to the teacher without looking at the paper. \"Thank you so much for doing that.\" Mike said. All of Mike's former classmates started to gather around. Charlie said, \"I put mine in my album.\" I think we all treasured our lists.\" Marilyn said.\nTears rolled down the eyes of the teacher. We may encounter so many people in our lives, and it's a precious joy to see the good in all those journeys.",
