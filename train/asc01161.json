  "article": "I went over my grandmother's house today and she didn't have time for me. You see, the lady's husband downstairs died and my Grandmother wanted to make some cookies for her. My grandmother did not analyze   how the lady treated her, or if the lady needed any cookies, or even if the lady would like the cookies. She didn't think how much the lady has done for her. She simply began baking.\nMy Grandmother turned 94 last week and this I believe is her secret to life. My grandmother is generous and hard-working in a way that is rare for our time. She lives by a simple belief: if someone needs your help, you help. Never mind all the analyzing and thinking whether the person deserves or appreciates the help. My grandmother doesn't sit around thinking about who might be making use of her: she simply does what is needed.\nAt 94, she is busy in life. She is making a blanket for a new great grandchild, and worried that I don't have enough kitchen towels for my home. She is bringing soup to a sick neighbor, and teaching the new wife of her cousin (who is 88) how to cook Italian food.\nMy grandmother had every right to give up, but she didn't -- and amazingly life did bring her good things, like a husband with twinkling blue eyes who was much ahead of his time and believed that men should do an equal amount of cooking and cleaning in the home, three beautiful children (my father and two aunts), 22 grandchildren, and five great grandchildren. My grandmother is not afraid to give someone she barely knows a bowl of soup. She never keeps herself out of the world.",
