  "article": "Many American schools have a student exchange program with foreign countries. Along with this program,there is usually another one called the\"American Host Family\"program.As its name suggests,the program gets American families involved in foreign students' lives in America and offers homes for them.\nForeign students generally welcome such an opportunity to have a\"family\"here,but there are also those who prefer to stay\"homeless\".\nMany American families volunteer to host foreign students.However,if there is a shortage of host families,schools also get in touch with local people and introduced foreign students to them.\nThe\"American Host Family\"program changes in lengths of time.It can go from a few days to a few years,depending on each individual school.After the first year is over,it is up to foreign students and their\"families\"to decide if they want to stay together as a\"family\".American families can host as many foreign students as they like.They can either have several students or just one at a time.Many families start with new students each year while still keeping in touch with the old ones.Schools usually leave it to foreign students and their host families to decide their activities after both sides meet.\nMy school, however, holds activities every year. On major holidays like Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas,foreign students are usually invited to their thomes for dinner.Even schools that do not have host family programs often arrange students to get together with American families on these special holiday occasions.\nIt is typical that a host family invites its foreign daughter or son over,and they cook the student's home food together,Undoubtedly,Chinese students are usually considered good cooks,whether or not they are really qualified for such praise at home.Although many Chinese students rarely cooked at home,they often have a hard time making their American friends believe that they cannot cook.It often happens when a Chinese student promises to cook a Chinese meal for his host family,he usually sees a little crowd expecting him:friends or relatives are also invited over for the\"special\"Chinese food!",
