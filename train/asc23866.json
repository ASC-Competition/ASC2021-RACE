  "article": "The Piano Lesson\nJenny wasn't interested in playing the piano. She liked writing stories and acting them out with her friends. But Mrs. Windsor gave her piano lessons for free, so she felt she should have a try. Every Sunday she had her piano lessons in Mrs. Windsor's house.\nOne Sunday morning, Jenny walked into Mrs. Windsor's music room and sat down on the piano bench  as usual.\n\"Hello,\" Jenny heard a voice behind her. She turned around and saw a young girl.\n\"What's your name?\" The girl asked.\nBefore Jenny could answer, Mrs. Windsor walked in and said, \"Jenny, this is my niece , Pasha. Pasha, this is Jenny. I need to go to hospital, so Pasha will give you your lesson today.\"\nPasha sat beside Jenny on the piano bench and asked, \"What piece do you like best?\"\n\"I don't know.\" Jenny said. \"They're all the same to me.\"\n\"You mean you don't have a favorite?\" Pasha was surprised.\n\"No, not really.\" Jenny said.\nPasha opened Jenny's music book and asked Jenny to play.\nAfter about a page or two, Pasha gently  put her hand on top of Jenny's. Jenny stopped. Then Pasha said, \"Jenny, what are you hearing in the music?\" Jenny looked at Pasha strangely.\n\"I don't know.\" Jenny said.\n\"Let me try and you listen,\" Pasha said. \"All you have to do is learn to hear the stories in the music.\"\n\"I've never thought of it that way.\" Jenny said.\n\"Let's try together, shall we?\" Pasha smiled. Together they played that afternoon and tried to find the story in the music. That day Jenny found playing the piano was not that difficult.",
