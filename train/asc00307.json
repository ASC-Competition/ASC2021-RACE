  "article": "Rainy days don't have to get you down, a happiness expert has claimed.\nPaul Dolan, Professor of Behavioral Science at the London School of Economics, said that people only feel _ in bad weather because they think about it too much. Studies have shown that people who live in warm, sunny climates are no happier than those in chilly, wet climates, he says.\nSo the British talking about the weather may be making us gloomier  than the weather itself.\nHe said: \"A study was done that measured the happiness levels of people in California compared to the North West.\n\"They expected that people in California would be happier because it is more sunny, but they found that levels of happiness were exactly the same.\n\"If it is sunny every day you get used to it and the sunshine doesn't make you any happier.\n\"Most of the time the weather doesn't affect our well-being at all. But when we think about it, and think that it does, that's when we get miserable.\"\nIn his new book, Happiness By Design, Dolan argues that we can think ourselves happy by taking our attention away from what makes us sad.\n\"Most of our anxieties come from what might be,\" he argues. \"If you want to be happier, pay attention to the things that make you feel good.\"\nHe also claimed that a problem shared was not always a problem halved. He claimed that humans are actually very good at being able to get over tragedy and loss.\nProfessor Dolan also admitted for the first time that he had a stammer , which had made his early life miserable. He claimed it only got better when he learned not to pay attention to his speech problem.\n\"Things are never as bad as you imagine them being,\" he said.",
