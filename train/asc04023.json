  "article": "Annie Oakley was born in 1860 in Darke County, Ohio. Her family was very poor. She decided to help her family even when she was very young, so she learned to use a gun, and began hunting   animals for food. She could shoot them without losing the important parts of the meat.\nSoon her shooting ability became well known. When she was sixteen, she was invited to a competition with a famous marksman  , Frank Butler. Annie surprised everyone by winning the competition. Later that year she and Frank married.\nIn 1882, Annie Oakley and Frank Butler started putting on shows together. Frank Butler was the star of the show and she was his assistant. The famous Native American leader, Sitting Bull, thought so highly of her shooting ability that he called her \"Little Sure Shot\". Later Annie Oakley became the star of the show and Frank Butler was her assistant. Posters   for the show called her the \"Champion Markswoman\".\nDuring World War One, Annie Oakley wanted to train a group of women volunteers for the army, but the United States did not accept it. She gave American soldiers shooting lessons, and traveled across the country visiting many training camps. She gave shooting performances and raised money to support the American soldiers.\nAnnie Oakley died on November 3, 1926. Eighteen days later, Frank Butler died too.",
