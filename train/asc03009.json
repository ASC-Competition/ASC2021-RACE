  "article": "Parents whose children think the latest Nike or Adidas shoes may be better than buying old-fashioned plimsolls   because they encourage a healthier style of running, researchers said.\nBig companies, like Nike and Adidas, make millions of dollars from selling highly-cushioned shoes  both as fashion and sports shoes. The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way. Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes, it is very difficult to change our technique, even if we remove our shoes, it can raise the risk of injury.\nChildren should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \"barefoot\" running style, experts said.\nDr Mick Wilknson, who did the research, told the British Science Festival in Newcastle, \"If I would advise someone on what to give their child, I would say don't go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike, just get them a pair of flexible, flat shoes. Give them basic foot-ware, nothing fancy, nothing particularly cushioned.\"\nRunning in flat shoes, barefoot, encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running, especially long distances as the human was designed to do.\nAround the world, and in particular in the US, running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes.\nDr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners, he said: \"Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s, despite claims of improvements in running shoes. That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better.\"",
