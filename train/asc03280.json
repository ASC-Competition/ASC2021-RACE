  "article": "One day a man was walking in the street when he met a penguin  .It was a handsome and very brave bird. It seemed to take an immediate liking to the man, because it walked up to him and then followed him wherever he went.This was funny for a while but in the end became rather embarrassing .\n\"Go away, you silly bird, ''the man said to the penguin, but the bird ignored him. It simply would not leave him alone.Wherever he went, the bird went too. At last, in desperation   the man walked into a police station.\"Excuse me, officer.\" he said. \"I need some advice. I met this penguin in the street and I don't know what to do with it.\"\nA bored policeman looked up from what he was writing and said, \"Just take it to the zoo, sir.''\n\"Oh,all right.''said the man.\nThe next day the man was walking along the street, still accompanied   by the penguin, when he met the policeman he'd spoken to the day before.The policeman was not pleased to see them.\"I thought I advised you to take that animal to the zoo, \" he said.\n\"Well, yes, officer, you did.And I did take him to the zoo, \" the man explained. \"And we had a great time. But we can't go to the zoo every day.I thought today I'd take him to the movies.''",
