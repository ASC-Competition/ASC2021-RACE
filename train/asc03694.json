  "article": "In June 2013 a five-year-old boy, Toby, was walking home from school thinking about the long summer ahead. Money was tight that year and Toby's parents had told him they would not be able to afford a holiday.\nInstead of dreaming about foreign travel, he had been reading a book, Letter to New Zealand, where the author explains what happens in an envelope's journey from England to the other side of the world. As they neared their house, Toby asked his mum, Sabine, if he could write a letter to New Zealand. After a few more steps he was struck by an even better idea. \"Can I write a letter to every country in the world?\"\nSabine says she often wonders what would have happened if she had replied differently that day. \"It was just one of those typical questions that five-year-olds have,\" she says. \" If he had asked me in the evening when I was tired, I might have refused. But as parents you realize there's a lot of power in just allowing kids to have a go. Also, it seemed a nice way to do some armchair exploration. So I told him\" Let's see how far you get.\"\nThe answer was very far indeed. Toby has since written and posted letters to all 193 UN mumber states, as well as numerous other bad-conditioned areas with comforting ones.\nTo date he has written 681 letters- the best of which have been selected to appear in a new book called Dear World, How Are You?- although so productive is Toby' pen that the number will have risen by the time you read this.\n\"Writing these letters has made me realize that the world isn't actually all that big,\" he says with a grin.\nIn the future, part of him would like to be a musical director to turn his beloved Star Wars into a ballet. Of course, he also hopes to travel the globe in person to see some of the countries where his letters have ended up.\n\"We're so lucky to have this wonderful world, and I hope we can live on planet Earth in peace.\"",
