  "article": "The United States Capitol Dome  in Washington, DC, is recognized around the world as a symbol of the U.S. Government. Since last November, the dome has been surrounded by metal poles and heavy cloth as part of a repair project.\nThe last major repair work on the U.S. Capitol took place in 1960. Since then, the dome has become weathered and worn. The Architect of the Capitol group reports that the dome has more than 1,000 narrow breaks on its surface and other damage.\nThe dome was completed around 1863. U. S. Senate Historian Don Ritchie says the dome's cast  iron frame is at special risk of weathering. \"The capitol dome, being cast iron, has been hit by lightning countless times. And so the current construction is to repair the leaks, to fill the cracks, to take off extra layers of paint.\"\nSome recent visitors to the Capitol were unhappy about its current appearance. They had hoped to get a picture of the usually shining dome. Joyce said, \"It was impressive, and very fantastic, and all white, but when I come here today, it is under construction so my family cannot see it clearly, it is kind of a disappointment.\"\nOthers were more understanding of the repairs. Rick Jones, another visitor, said, \"It's a little inconvenient for us not to see the dome but you have to think about the future and the people will be coming to this place for centuries...and you know ,there just needs to be preventive maintenance . I am not upset with that at all.\"\nThe project is expected to take more than two years to complete. The dome should be ready for a new president in January 2017.",
