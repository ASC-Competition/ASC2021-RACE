  "article": "A terrible competition is going on in England, with billions of dollars and hundreds of lives at risk. OK, that's not true. But competitors from around the world gathered on Thursday for the annual competition to compete for the world's biggest person who tells lies.\nEach participant is given up to five minutes to make up the best _ in the contest, which was founded in honor of 19th-century Bridge Inn landlord Will Ritson, who was reportedly famous for his lies. Competitors gather at the Bridge Inn every year for the competition, a small pub in northwestern England. Anyone but lawyers and politicians can take part in the competition.\nA study found that nearly all lies are detectable   through visible facial muscle reactions in the person telling a lie. \"Thus, while interpersonal cheat often is highly successful, signs of hidden emotional states are communicated clearly to the informed observer,\" the study concluded.\nA churchman of Carlisle reportedly holds what may be the greatest lie of all time in the competition, simply stating, \"I have never told a lie in my life.\"\nIn 2003, Abrie Krueger from South Africa became the first one to win the competition. In 2006, comedian Sue Perkins became the first female to win the competition, telling a tale about people riding camels to work as a result of climate change.",
