  "article": "The companies below offer student accommodation  all around London, no matter what university you are attending. And they limit the complications   that other rental companies can have (such as paying for heat and hot water, paying your rent yearly and so on).\nCRM Students has 12 different properties   to choose from in London with various size choices depending on your budget and requirements. Prices start from PS 140 per week.\nInternational Students House is unique because they offer twin, triple and quad rooms, which means they are cheaper per week than others. Of course, you will be sharing your bedroom with up to three other people. Prices start from PS 78.4 per week.\nProdigy Living has several properties in London (most of which have just been decorated) and offers en-suite   rooms in flats and one-bedroom flats. Prices start from PS 209 per week.\nScape Living has properties in Greenwich, Surrey and Shoreditch, with the latter two being new apartments as of 2015, which means they will be in pretty good condition. Prices start from PS 185 per week.\nUnite Students offers student accommodation in various areas of London, from en-suite rooms to two-bedroom flats, with lots of sharing choices available. Prices start from PS169 per week.\nThese student housing associations are the best I found on the Internet for cheap student accommodation in London; however, I am aware that new ones are appearing every day. For a full list of associations like these (but most are more expensive than those listed above), I recommend checking out UCL's alternative accommodation page.\nNote: Most rooms require a small deposit  , which is typically the same value as your weekly rental price ( for example, PS 200 per week =PS 200 deposit before you move in).",
