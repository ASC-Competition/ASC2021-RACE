  "article": "Having spring around makes you feel different after such a long winter journey. The power of sunshine brings us a lot of comfort, optimism, self-confidence and of course a smile. Imagine how great it will be if we are so positive all year round!\nLiving like this is possible if you really think about it. In order to exist in such a state of happiness, we must have sunshine radiating from within ourselves, shining from our hearts, minds and souls. Actually,that's your choice, and if you think that way then your own life will reflect that attitude of yours!\nIn order to make \"sunshine\" or rather, \"light\" part of our being, it is so important that you watch your thoughts, your words and your actions so that you will accept what you really feel you'd like to create in your own life. Watch your thoughts and really become aware of how many negative thoughts pass through your mind about yourself and other people around you. Watch to see how often you gossip  about other people, which is actually often attached with feelings of jealousy  and insecurity about yourself.\nYou are also supposed to take a close look at your \"intention\". How many of you do something for another person without expecting to receive something in return? It might not even have to be a material or physical thing you expect; expecting to be recognized for what you have done is enough to create conditions on Having spring around makes you feel differentyour intention. Think about it!\nPutting all of these together, it seems that most of us are creating monsters inside us just by simply talking, thinking and not putting our heart out with the right intention towards helping someone else. If you take all your negative attitudes in one hand and measure your need to feel \"sunshine\" in the other, you will see how both these elements really contradict each other.\nBe brave and break your patterns and your habits this spring, and by doing so,you will allow the true sunshine to take place by radiating out from your heart and into your life and the lives of the people around you!",
