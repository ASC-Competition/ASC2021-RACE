  "article": "Ethiopia has greatly reduced its death rates for children under the age of five years during the last two decades, new UN statistics show. The report says Ethiopia has cut the number of child deaths, by two thirds or so, to 68 per 1,000 births compared to that in 1990.\nThe government owed the improved figures to its growing economy. Despite the reduction, the UN Children's Fund said Ethiopia needed to do much more to improve health facilities  for pregnant women.\nEthiopia is one of Africa's poorest states, although it has experienced rapid economic growth in recent years and is one of the continent's leading coffee producers. Its economy centers around agriculture, which in turn relies on rainfall.\nThe BBC's Emmanuel Igunza in the capital, Addis Ababa, says Ethiopia was once representative of poor nutrition in Africa. But the latest UNICEF  figures show Ethiopia is one of the few African countries on the path to realizing the development goal of reducing child death rates, he says.\nEthiopia's Health Minister Kesetebirhan Admasu said increasing family incomes had helped improve people's health. \"This has also resulted in better nutrition for children and women; this has translated into better medical conditions ---- all these have a direct or indirect influence on the survival of children,\" he told BBC Africa. He said the government has also been \"aggressively expanding its primary health care network\".\n\"We have now 93% coverage( ) of one health centre for 25,000 people, which basically means one health facility within a 7km area,\" he said.",
