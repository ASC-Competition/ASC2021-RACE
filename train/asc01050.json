  "article": "A young woman was diagnosed with a terminal illness and given three months to live. So as she was getting her things \"in order\", she asked her pastor to come to her house to discuss her final wishes. With everything in order, the pastor was ready to leave when the young woman suddenly remembered something very important to her.\n\"What's that?\" asked the pastor.\n\"I want to be buried with a fork in my right hand.\"\nThe pastor stood looking at the young woman, not knowing what to say.\n\"That surprises you, doesn't it?\" the young woman asked.\n\"Well, to be honest, I'm puzzled by the request,\" said the pastor.\nThe young woman explained, \"In all my years of going to church meetings and dinners, I remember that when the dishes of the main course were being cleared, someone would always lean over and say, 'Keep your fork.' It was my favorite part because I knew that something better was coming, like chocolate cake or apple pie,some dessert like that. Something wonderful! I just want people to see me there in that casket with a fork so that when they ask you why I have a fork, you can tell them: 'Keep your fork--the best is yet to come.'\"\nThe pastor hugged the young woman good-bye. He knew that the young woman had a better grasp of heaven than he did. She had a better grasp of what heaven would be like than many people twice her age, with twice as much experience and knowledge.\nAt the funeral people were walking by the young woman's casket and they saw the pretty dress she was wearing and the fork placed in her right hand. Over and over, the pastor heard the question \"Why does she have a fork?\" And over and over again he smiled.\nSo the next time you reach down for your fork, let it reminded you of this young woman gently. Send the message to everyone you consider a friend even if it means sending it back to the person who sent it to you.\nAnd, keep your fork!!",
