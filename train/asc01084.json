  "article": "It was a beautiful day at the beach--blue sky, gentle wind, calm sea.I knew these things because a man sitting five feet from me was shouting them into his mobile phone, like a play-by-play announcer  .\n\"IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY,\" he shouted.\"THE SKY IS BLUE, AND THERE'S A GENTLE WIND, AND THE WATER IS CALM, AND...\"\nBehind me, a woman, her mobile phone pressed to her ear was walking back and forth.\n\"She DIDN'T,\" she was saying.\"No.She DIDN'T.She DID? Really? Are you SERIOUS? She did NOT.She DID? No she...\"\nAnd so on.This woman had two children, who were playing in the sea.I found myself watching them, because the woman surely was not.A huge squid could have caught and snatched the children, and this woman would not have noticed.Or, if she had noticed, she'd have said, \"Listen.I have to go, because a huge squid just......No!

BREEP! The corpse sits up, feels urgently for its mobile phone, and shouts \"Hello! I'm at the beach! Yes! It's nice! Very peaceful! What? She did? No, she didn't! She DID? No, she...\"\nLoud mobile-phoners never seem to get urgent calls.Just once, I'd like to hear one of them say, \"Hello? Yes, this is Dr.Johnson.Oh, Dr.Smith.You've opened the abdominal cavity  ? Good! Now the appendix should be right under the ... What? No, that's the liver.Don't take THAT out, ha ha! Oh, you did? My God! OK, now listen carefully...\"",
