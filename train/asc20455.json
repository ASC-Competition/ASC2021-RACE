The movie is about a poor man Ti, his son Dicky and their alien dog CJ7.\nDicky, a 10-year-old boy, lives a poor life with his father Ti, a worker. One day,his father finds a ball in the trash  and he gives it to Dicky. The ball becomes a cute alien dog. It's a small dog with big eyes and green hair. It can talk and do magic . Soon the dog comes to love Ti and his son. It goes to school with Dicky. It makes him laugh, but it makes trouble, too.\nWhen Ti falls off a building and dies, CJ7 saves his life. Because the dog loses all its power , it becomes a doll. But Dicky still wears the dog around his neck. He hopes that CJ7 will come back to life one day.",
