  "article": "Losing a job is considered one of the five most stressful life changes you can experience. Those who have been there say it feels like being robbed of your identity and is as painful as the loss of a loved one.\nIt may be hard to believe at first, but finally you can use this experience as your advantage--to find another, perhaps even better job, to strengthen your relationship with your family, and to make some much-needed changes in your life. Here are three essential steps.\nStep1 Get emotional support. Because it's easy to feel uneasy and vulnerable , turning to others is the key to making a smooth transition . You'll need people who will listen and provide a safe place for you to cry, or to express your fears and concerns.\nDon't go it alone. It takes courage to ask for help, and yet, help may be what you need most to move forward.\nStep2 Seek professional guidance. Getting assistance from a recruiter  or career adviser will not only help you value your experience and improve your skills, it also will ensure that you put your best foot forward. Once again, your local unemployment office should have helpful resources.\nIf possible, try not to let fear cause you to grab the first new job you're offered (unless it's the right one). Give yourself time to explore different choices.\nStep3 _ . Meet with family members to openly discuss your feelings. Listen carefully without interrupting one another, and give everyone a turn to speak. When a man I know did this with his family, his wife agreed to leave the job search planning to him and his outplacement adviser. In turn, he agreed to keep her informed about the process on a weekly basis. When you keep the lines of communication open, you can build stronger relationships.\nOnce you've got a new job, create your own security. Keep your resume up-to-date, stay in touch with recruiters about the job market, and constantly improve your skills to stay marketable in your field.\nAlthough being laid-off can turn your life upside down, many people say that it gave them push they needed to start a new life!",
