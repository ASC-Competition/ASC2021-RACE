  "article": "To: \"The Shoe People\" <inquiries@shoepeople.com>\nFrom: \"John Trimbald\" <jtconstruction@img.com>\nSubject: Customer Complaint\nTo Whom it May Concern,\nI have trusted the Shoe People to protect the feet of my employees for over ten years now. I recently purchased a few pairs of boots from your company for my crew. Though my men were initially satisfied with the boots, the soles began to fall apart on them after just twelve weeks. This was extremely surprising considering they came with a six year warranty. The boots are unsafe to wear because my men are pouring hot concrete. Please respond as soon as possible with instructions on how I can return the boots and receive a refund.\nThank you,\nJohn Trimbald, Foreman, JT Construction\nTo: \"John Trimbald\" <jtconstruction @ img. com>\nFrom: \"The Shoe People\" <inquiries @ shoepeople. com>\nDear Mr. Trimbald,\nThank you for your e-mail concerning the poor quality of our rubber soled black workboots. A representative will be by your office next week to pick up the damaged boots. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you and your crew.\nAlong with five new pairs of workboots for your crew (we included one extra pair), we have enclosed a free year's supply of sole protector spray. In our retail stores, this spray is always recommended to buyers who work on heated floors. This should have been brought to your attention at the time of your initial order. Please excuse our oversight.\nTo date we have had no complaints about these workboots from customers who have used the protector spray. However, should you use the spray and find that you are still unsatisfied with the boots, please return the boots and spray for a full refund. Thank you for supporting The Shoe People. Have a Happy New Year.\nSincerely,\nStan Mason, President",
