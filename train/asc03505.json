  "article": "What do you remember about your childhood? I have good memories of exploring  the fields near my house and riding my bike around the park. Today, children don't spend enough time in the fresh air. Many of them fix their eyes on a screen either on a computer, or a TV ---they seem to be living in a _ world. They have lost touch with nature.\nNow 400 organizations in the UK are encouraging children to have some \"wild time\". They want kids to exchange at least 30 minutes of watching TV or playing computer games for time playing outside. The simple pleasures of exploring and discovering nature help children to learn and keep fit too. Andy Simpson, who is part of the campaign , says: \"An extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for all under 12-year-olds in the UK would be the equivalent  of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors.\" Even if the kids live in a city, they can go on adventures in the garden or the park. However, children often need a helping hand from Mum and Dad. They need to be shown what to do and where to go.\nSo despite  the complex  world that young people grow up in now, it seems that going back to basics and experiencing \"nature's playground \" is what modern children need. Andy Simpson adds: \"We want parents to see what this magical \"playground\" does for their kids' development , independence and creativity  , by giving wild time a go \" . David Bond from Project Wild Thing says, \"We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted. \"",
