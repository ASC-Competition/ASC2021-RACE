  "article": "Xinhua News--The Beijing government has set out to _ thousands of university graduates to work as junior officials in rural areas to both improve rural administration and ease the city's employment problems.\nThe government plans to recruit 3,000 university graduates this year, 1,000 more than last year, to work as assistants to village heads or party secretaries in suburban areas.\nPeople interested in jobs in Beijing's rural villages and towns can send applications to Beijing Municipal Bureau of Personnel or log on to www.bjbys.com from February 1 through March 15.\n\"We hope university graduates will seize this opportunity to use their knowledge in rural villages and to start their careers,\" Sun Zhenyu, the Deputy Director of Beijing Personnel Bureau, told Xinhua News Agency.\nThe government has promised successful candidates a monthly salary of 2,000 Yuan in the first year, 2,500 Yuan the second year and 3,000 the third year, provided their performance is up to the required standards, Sun said.\nWang Lina, who graduated from Beijing Union University last year, was one of the first graduates to find work in the city's countryside. After majoring in Industrial and Commercial Administration, Wang served as the assistant to the village head of Ertiaojie Village in suburban Beijing's Pinggu District. For one project, Wang contacted people at Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences and arranged for the local farmers to receive training in strawberry planting. Her efforts paid off. The village had a plentiful harvest of organic strawberries earlier this year.\nNationwide, about 150,000 university graduates found employment in rural areas last year, according to the figures provided by the Ministry of Education.\nThe ministry predicts that 4.95 million students will graduate from universities across the country this year, 820,000 more than last year. About 1.4 million of them are unlikely to find jobs when they graduate. In Beijing, a record of 200,000 people are expected to graduate from university this year. Less than half of them are expected to be offered jobs, according to Beijing Personnel Bureau.",
