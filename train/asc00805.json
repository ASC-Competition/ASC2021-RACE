  "article": "My mother was a household servant. Through her work, she observed that successful people spent a lot more time reading than they did watching television. She announced that my brother and I could only watch two to three pre-selected TV programs during the week. With our free time, we had to read two books each from the Detroit Public Library and write book reports. She would mark them up with check marks. Years later we realized her marks were a _ My mother had only received a third-grade education. Although we had no money, between the covers of those books, I could go anywhere, do anything and be anybody.\nWhen I entered high school, I was an A-student, but not for long. I wanted the fancy clothes. I wanted to hang out with the guys. I went form being an A- student to a B- student to a C-student, but I didn't care.\nOne night my mother came home and I complained about not having enough shirts. She said, \"Okay, I'll give you all the money I make this week cleaning floors and bathrooms, and you can buy the family food and pay the bills. With everything left over, you can have all the shirts you want.\"\nI was very pleased with that arrangement but once I got through allocating  money, there was nothing left. I realized my mother was a financial genius to be able to keep a roof over our heads and any kind of food on the table, much less buy clothes.\nI also realized that immediate satisfaction wasn't going to get me anywhere. Success required intellectual  preparation. I went back to my studies and became an A-student again. I dreamed of becoming a doctor when I was just a kid. And now I have achieved my dream.\nOver the years my mother's changeless faith in God has inspired me, particularly when I found myself faced with my own medical illness. A few years ago I discovered I had a very serious cancer; I was told it might have spread to my spine . My mother believed in God very much. She never worried. She said that God would never throw me away forever; there was no way that _ was going to be a major problem. The abnormality in spine turned out to be not bad; I was able to have surgery and am cured.\nMy story is really my mother's story -a woman little formal education or worldly goods who used her position as a parent to change the lives of her children.",
