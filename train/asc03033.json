  "article": "Last year, the most-read children' s books at least in UK were almost all fantasy novels. But why is this the case? What. exactly does fantasy offer to young readers?\nWhat' s important to point out here is that fantasy writing has come to be considered as belonging to popular culture, and is therefore generally regarded as being of lower quality than realism.\nThis idea was formed in me during childhood by my mother, who believed that fantasy was \"rubbish\". She was always trying to persuade my two brothers to let go of their dog-eared copies of American author David Eddings' books and read something \"proper\".\nI had also met some people who were against reading fantasy.

From the 450 million copies of Harry Potter books sold over this period to the more recent Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, it would seem that children are as enthusiastic about fantasy as ever before and rather than \"progressing\" out of fantasy, the popularity of fantasy in the young adult market would suggest just the opposite.",
