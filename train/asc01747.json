  "article": "The human body is designed to move. But modern lifestyles and office jobs rarely give us the chance to move around. As we know. we're while we're eating; we sit in the car and we sit while we watch TV. And many of us sit for many hours at work.\nNew research shows that sitting less than three hours a day might extend your life by two years. Peter Katzmarzyk,a scientist at the University of Louisiana in the southern United States,says that sitting is ubiquitous in our lives,meaning it is something we do all the time,everywhere.\nHowever,Mr. Katzmarzyk says that does not mean you can sit for the rest of your waking hours. He also says you may exercise often,\"We can't throw away physical activity. It's extremely important. We have 60 years of research showing us that. \"\nMr. Katzmarzyk and his coi leagues are part of a new generation of researchers studying how sitting all day affects length of life. \"Studies that have assessed the relationship between sitting and mortality or television viewing and mortality are very rare. There's only been a few of them,actually five or six now,in the last four or five years. \"They found that cutting television time to less than two hours a day could add one-point four years to life.\nLuckily,change is already coming to some offices,especially in the design of desks. A \"standing desk\"lets people stand while they work. Another new design is called the \"treadmill desk. \" A treadmill is an exercise machine that lets you walk in one place. Even some U. S. schools are beginning to experiment with desks that are part bicycle to keep children moving. That's one of the strategies that many companies are using now.\nMr. Katzmarzyk also says studying this problem has inspired his team to make a few changes in their own lives.",
