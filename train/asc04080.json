  "article": "Reading is the key to success. Apparently every successful person develops a passion for reading. This is because reading is a key element to obtain the information required to understand something. For instance, lawyers have to study and learn every established law on their specific branches. Sometimes the law changes according to people's needs. A good lawyer has to be informed about the latest news in the court. A doctor has to be informed of the latest advances in medicine.\nReading is very important for all mankind. Everything is relative in this world, especially reading. Reading can open any doors and it can lead you into a path of success. Studies have confirmed that reading to your unborn child is very good. This way your child will develop a passion for reading.\nHow do you develop a passion for reading? There is only one way you can boost your passion for reading. Let me explain this to you. If you want to learn how to ride a bike, you have to get on the bike as many times as possible until you have learned. It works the same way with reading. If you want to boost your reading, take a book and read it all the way through. When you finish reading your first book, take another book and do the same. Try to read as much as you can. If you are going out, grab a magazine, a book, an article or something to read.\nThere is a very important factor behind the reading--reading comprehension. It's what makes you understand the meaning behind the text. Let's assume that you read a document and you are supposed to explain the meaning of the document. How would you explain the document if you couldn't capture the message of the author?",
