  "article": "Charles Darwin (1809 - 1882) was a great naturalist, famous for his theory of evolution  .\nOne day two boys decided to play a trick on the great man. They took the body of a centipede  , the head of a beetle  , the leg of a grasshopper  , and the wings of a butterfly, and glued them together. Putting the strange creature into a box carefully, they took it to Darwin.\n\"Please, sir,\" said one of the two boys, \"can you tell us what sort of a bug   this is?\"\nThe naturalist looked at the bug and then at the boys. \"Did it hum  ?\" he asked.\n\"Oh, yes. It did!\"\n\"In that case,\" declared Darwin, \"I would say it's a humbug  !\"",
