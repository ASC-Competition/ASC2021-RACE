  "article": "Little Mike's grandma died weeks ago. He missed her very much. One afternoon Mike went to the city park where his grandma used to go. There he saw an old lady. She looked very kind. She was sitting there, watching pigeons . Little Mike went up and sat next to her. He took out his food and drinks and gave some to her. She smiled at him. Her smile was so sweet that Mike wanted to see it again. She seemed to understand him, so once again she smiled. Mike was very glad.\nThey sat there all the afternoon, eating and talking. As it got dark, Mike got up to leave. Before he left, he hugged the old lady and she gave him her sweetest smile.\nWhen Mike got home, his mother was surprised by the look of joy on his face. \"I met a granny in the park. Her smile was like the kind of smile I had seen on Grandma's face.\"\nThe old lady also returned to her home happily. She told her son that she had food and drinks with a little boy. \"He was as lovely as Brittany,\" she said. Her son was surprised, because he had never seen her so happy since Brittany, her grandson, died weeks ago.\n.",
