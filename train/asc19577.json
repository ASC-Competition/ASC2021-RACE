  "article": "The moon looks bigger than the stars at night. But in fact, it is smaller than any other stars. The moon looks big to us, because it is closer to us than any stars. The moon goes around the earth. It makes one trip about four weeks. The moon is a round ball and looks beautiful.\nNow people know quite a lot about the moon. There is no air or water on the moon, so there are not any trees or animals, or people on it. The moon gets its light  from the sun, but some places on the moon are quite dark. It's very hot on the moon during the day, but it's very cold at night.",
