  "article": "More than 27,000 people from around the UK set off at dawn from London to begin the cycle route through Surrey to the Sussex coast.\nThe annual 54-mile ride raises money for the British Heart Foundation(BHF)  and is Europe's largest charity cycling event. Cyclists began the exhausting journey at Clapham Common at 6 a. m. , hoping to reach Brighton seafront within an average of six hours.\nMoney from today's event will help the charity to continue its vital work through heart research and the development of its care and support services. Among those taking part was BBC Breakfast's resident Dr Rosemary Leonard and several colleagues.\nBHF spokeswoman Gemma Cloke said, \"It was quite cold this morning, but everyone set off without any problems.\" Those taking part range in age from 14 to those in their 70s. Last year cyclists raisedPS4. 1 million for the charity, and have raised more thanPS50 million since the BHF became involved in the event in 1980. The first ride was held in 1976. It is hoped this year's fund raising total could reachPS4. 5 million. She added : \"We have a lot of people taking part, from the more experienced cyclists to those cycling with friends and family in memory of someone and to raise money through sponsorship.\"\n\"People are always pleased knowing the money is going to a good cause. There is so much support along the route, with local residents watching the ride. \"\n\"One of the highlights for participants is coming along the seafront while people are clapping, which can really help when they've been in the saddle   for a long time. \"",
