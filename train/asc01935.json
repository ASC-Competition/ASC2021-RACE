  "article": "How much do you hate waiting for another beer in a crowded bar? Josh Goodman invented a pretty obvious solution --self-service beer taps. Goodman, 36, recalled the exact moment in late 2008 when his frustration _ \"I was hanging out with my friends at a Baltimore sports bar before an Orioles  game,\" he said. \"We just couldn't get another beer served to us quickly.\"\nEven more than annoyed, Goodman was struck by how much money the bar must be losing. Almost immediately, he got to work on a self-service beer concept. Within a few months, Goodman had launched Pour My Beer in Chicago (where he'd relocated to be with his wife).\nHe invested  $20,000 of his own funds and partnered with a U.S. manufacturer to make beer tables with two to four self-service taps. In February 2009, Goodman landed his first client : A Baltimore tavern. He spent the next two years growing the business and adding more bars and restaurants. In 2011, Pour My Beer introduced self-service \"beer walls,\" which let people pour their own beer from taps on a wall.\nPour My Beer has expanded to over 200 restaurants and bars in 28 states and Canada. The concept will roll out in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport this week and in Italy and Brazil later this year. The tables start at $4,000 and the beer walls cost as much as $16,000. It generated more than $400,000 in sales in 2013 and doubled that in 2014. Goodman expects to take in close to $2 million in revenue this year(2015) --which would make it the company's first profitable year. \"Our business customers tell us that they've cut down on waste and they're selling twice as much beer on average,\" said Goodman.",
