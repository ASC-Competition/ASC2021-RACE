  "article": "In a touching story, a family was shocked to find that a stranger had secretly paid for more than half of their Christmas gifts.\nWhen Ayers went to make a payment toward the $283 balance for her family's Christmas gifts at Walmart, her money was refused. According to a Walmart employee, a woman had paid a part of Ayers' bill after seeing her shopping in the store. The unknown woman also left Ayers a touching note, which left the mother of two in tears.\nAyers, whose sons are 11 and 3, says the stranger's great generosity came at the perfect time for her family. Before the anonymous payment was made, Ayers had worried she would not be able to get her kids' toys in time for Christmas.\nAyers is still looking for the woman who helped pay for their Christmas gifts for her kids. She took a picture of her receipt with the headline: This stranger paid 4 gifts for us. I wish I could thank her for helping give our kids a Merry Christmas!\nFor thousands of families like Ayers', feeling this financial pressure around Christmastime is nothing new. These families who still have a roof over their heads and food on their tables often slip through the cracks -- they can afford all the necessities, but the \"extras\" are harder to come by. Considering that Americans are estimated to spend $882 on Christmas gifts this year, it makes sense that a family with a few financial problems would have a hard time filling the stockings for their kids.\nRealizing how common this Christmas problem really is makes Ayers' story even more special. These random acts of kindness around the holidays, often from nameless strangers, can determine what a family's Christmas looks like. Christmas may not be all about the material stuff, but for families, and especially for kids, it's the little things that can make the biggest difference.",
