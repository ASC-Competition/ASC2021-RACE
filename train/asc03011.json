  "article": "He met her at a party. She was outstanding while he was so normal. After the party, he invited her for coffee. She was surprised but being polite, she agreed.\nAs they sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything and she felt uncomfortable. Suddenly, he asked the waiter, \"Could you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee. \" Everyone stared at him. He turned red, but when the salt came, he put it in his coffee and drank. Curious, she asked, \"Why salt with coffee? \" He explained, \" When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing on the sea. I could feel the taste of sea, just like this salty coffee. \"\nThat was a really nice talk, also a good beginning of their story. They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who met all her demands. Then the story was just like every beautiful love story: they got married and lived a happy life.\nAfter 40 years, he passed away and left her a letter which said: My dearest, please forgive my life-long lie. Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous that I asked for salt instead of sugar. It was hard for me to ask for a change, so I just went ahead. I never thought that could be the start of our conversation. I tried to tell you the truth, but I was afraid that it would ruin everything. I don't like the salty coffee. But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life just because I love you!\nHer tears made the letter totally wet. Someday, someone asked her, \"What's the taste of salty coffee?\" She replied, \"It's sweet.\"",
