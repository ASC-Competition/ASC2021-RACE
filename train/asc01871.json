  "article": "Last night, on my way home I stopped because of being attracted by some hamburgers at a fast food restaurant. On my way in, a homeless man approached me and asked, \"Do you have any bottles lying around?\" I knew he would recycle them for a few cents, but I didn't have any, so I said no. And again he asked, \"Can you spare some change ?\" I smiled, and said no again. He was very respectful; he smiled back and said, \"OK, thank you.\" Even though he didn't have anything, he was still in good spirits. From the way he spoke I could tell he was smart.\nThen I bought one hamburger and enjoyed my meal, but in the back of my mind I wondered whether the homeless man was hungry. After I finished my meal I decided to order another one for him. At this point I didn't know if he was still around, but I tried anyway.\nAt the counter I ordered a hamburger and also a hot chocolate, because it was cold outside, and I thought it would help warm him up. They delivered me the hot chocolate first and as I waited for my hamburger, I noticed the homeless man was standing right beside me. I looked at him and smiled, \"This hot chocolate is for you.\" He replied like a gentleman, \"Thank you so much. That's very kind of you.\"\nI always believe no matter how _ I am, there are always those who are worse off than I. When you help someone, it's not always about money, it's about love. The love you give today, someone might forget tomorrow. It doesn't matter. Love anyway, because the greatest thing you can give is love.",
