  "article": "The word dream is probably heard most frequently from people in show business, where everyone dreams of standing under the spotlight and being somebody. But the truth is that most end up being nobodies. Hong Kong director Derek Yee's latest film\" I Am Somebody\" shows respect for these unknown extras in the film industry.\nIn the film, Wan Guopeng, son of a woodcutter, comes a long way from the Northeast with only 1,000 yuan to the dream factory of the East to become an actor. In real life, when the young man was chosen by the director to play the leading role, he had only 20 yuan left but still hadn't considered giving up.\nFamous Hong Kong actor Tony Leung remembered that 30 years ago, he was a salesman but knew that it was not the kind of life he wanted to live. \"Wan is exactly like me back then...Only when I was in an acting training course did I realize that what I wanted to be was an actor, not a star winning the best actor awards.\"\nYee chose real nobodies to play themselves in the movie. Their strength was their deep understanding of the feelings of the characters they played. But the disadvantage was also obvious: They lacked acting skills. When emotional performances were needed, their expressions and moves seemed unnatural.\nThe entertainment industry might be the field with the most broken hearts and most efforts gone _ . Here luck, opportunity and physical appearance are probably much more important than hard work.\nIn the film, Qin Peijun, a survivor from a coal mine collapse , goes all out to take hold of every possibility to appear in the lens of the camera, even if only as an extra. However, it is obviously much harder for him to realize the dream of becoming a professional actor than for Wang Zhao, who is a lazy bone with a pretty face.\nSome critical comments are directed at the sudden inversion  in the last part of the film. The two leading actors' happy endings seem to disagree with the film's realistic style. But anyway, this movie is not a documentary but a way to reinforce  that every brave heart deserves to have their dreams realized.",
