  "article": "Drinking green tea is known to be good for you. Some people suggest drinking 2-3 cups of it a day, and I would say at least one is highly advisable. \n     As many people have already known, tea is filled with powerful antioxidants   that will help stop free radicals  . Free radicals are harmful to our systems in that they can lead to cell   and DNA change, even cell death, and can lead to cancer. \n     Green tea has been drunk throughout Thailand, China, India and Japan for centuries. It is known in these places that green tea can help improve digestion   and mental clearness and lower one's blood sugar. It can also help control bleeding, so that injuries can be cured more quickly.\n     Some studies even suggest that drinking green tea on a regular basis can help a person lose weight. Green tea can help a person feel fuller throughout the day with its pleasant smell and taste, and just taking the time to smell it can help ease   one's hunger.\n     In short, both studies of green tea and its history show that it is a great thing to drink for your health.",
