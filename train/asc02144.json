  "article": "About 45 percent of Americans don't get enough sleep, according to a recent survey. However, the benefits of getting enough sleep far outweigh the thrill of watching TV for one more hour or surfing the web. Getting a better night's sleep will help you lose or keep your weight more effectively. Try these simple steps to improve your quality of sleep.\nTake time to relax\nSo many of us go-go-go until it's time for bed, but it's important to take time to slow down and relax before sleeping. Do relaxing things, such as listening to soothing   music or deep breathing. Avoid stimulating   activities such as writing e-mails, talking on the phone and watching TV. Some guidelines  : no e-mail after 8 p.m. and no TV or phone calls after 9 p.m..\nDarker is better\nYour body regulates your sleep cycle in response to the presence and absence of light, so dim the lights as evening approaches. Try getting ready for bed by candlelight. When you're ready to sleep, make sure your room is as dark as possible.\nPut your thoughts to bed\nWe all need time to process our day, but bed is not the place to do it if you want to sleep well. Take 10 to 15 minutes to record your thoughts in a journal. This effective technique will capture what's in your mind so you don't lie awake. Tell yourself you're putting your thoughts to bed so that you can go to bed.\nNo sugar or alcohol before bed\nThese may wake you up. If you need a snack before bed, make it protein.\nTry to get more sleep\nGet an extra hour or two of sleep every night for a week and see how you feel. You'll notice the difference!",
