  "article": "What is colour? Why do some of the things around us look red, some green, others blue?\nColours are really made by reflected light. We see colour because most of the things reflect light. Something is red, for it reflects most of the red light. In the same way, if something is green, it reflects most of the green light. If something reflects all light, it is white. If it doesn't reflect any light, it is black.\nSome of the light is reflected and some is taken in and turned into heat .The darker the colour is, the less light is reflected, the more light is taken in. So dark-coloured clothes are warmer in the sun than light-coloured clothes.",
