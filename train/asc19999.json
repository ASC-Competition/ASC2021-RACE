  "article": "Have you heard about \"Survival Holidays\"?\"Survival Holidays\" is for children to go into the lonely place for exciting activities. Now about 1,100 companies are allowed to take children into the great outdoors without their parents.\nThe reason why people like \"Survival Holidays\" is that they think being close to nature is good for children. Many children in big cities spend all time watching TV and playing computer games. \"Survival Holidays\" gives them an important change.\nIs \"Survival Holidays\" a wonderful idea? Maybe it is. Children need more free time to play. They need to be left on their own, without adults disturbing them. Parents care too much about their children. They like to see the children being busy with activities that are controlled by adults, which causes many problems. They don't know what to do when they are in danger. Even something like crossing a small river seems to be a hard _ . Children are not comfortable with danger. Even slight danger like getting their feet wet or falling down seems very terrible to them.\nMany people think the survival activities are good for children. Even years later, they will still remember what they have learned. Some have learned to stay calm in different times. Some have learned how to keep safe. Others have learned how to work in a team. All these skills will help them a lot in their lives.",
