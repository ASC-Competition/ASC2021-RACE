  "article": "Besides providing an ideal environment for sea plants and animals to live in, seawater has other values, one of which is that it constantly moves, and its movements produce energy.\nThe most obvious movements are waves and the tides. Winds causes the waves, and the gravitational pull of the moon and the son causes tides. In places like the Bay of Fundy in Canada, the difference between the high and low tide level can be as much as 40 feet.\nFrance and Britain are now trying to use energy in the tides to produce electricity. Waves can produce electricity and some experiments are taking place to learn more about this. One of the most encouraging areas of research uses the difference between the temperature of seawater at the surface and deep down to produce electricity.",
