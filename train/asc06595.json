  "article": "Just 25 years ago, the top three career hopes for young people in Britain were teacher, banker and doctor.Now, they want to be sports star, pop star and actor, according to survey by the Guardian newspaper.\nRachel, a character in the popular TV show Glee, may be said to speak for British teenagers.\"Nowadays being nobody is worse than being poor.\" He said.\nEmma Brockes, a reporter with the Guardian, believes it is \"the bad influence of celebrity  culture\"  that is to blame.\"When children wanted to be doctor, it wasn't because they were really more interested in the functions of human organs than they are now; you go where the respect is.\" She wrote.\nIt could explain why there has been such an increase in levels of anxiety and depression.Dr Carlo Stranger, of Tel Aviv University, studied the sense of self for his new book The Fear of Insignificance: Searching for Meaning in the 21st Century.He told the Daily Mail that young people now are \"affected by the close connection to the global entertainment network, which has turned ranking and rating people according to wealth and celebrity into an obsession .\"\n\"As humans, we naturally measure ourselves to those around us, but now we live in a global village.We are comparing ourselves with the most 'important' people in the world and finding ourselves wanting,\" he said.Today, even high achievers constantly fear that they are insignificant when they compare themselves to success stories in the media.\nThe way out? Simply stop measuring your achievement through a fantasy of wealth and celebrity.Dr Strenger said that it is a process called \"active self-acceptance through a constant search for self-knowledge through life.\"\n\"The fear of insignificance can only be overcome through strong individual and cultural identity over and above measurable achievement,\" he said.",
