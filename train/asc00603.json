  "article": "My name's Geoffrey Chaucer. It was 16thApril 1386, and I was in London at an inn in Southwark. Tomorrow I would go to Canterbury, to the shrine   of Saint Thomas Becket, together with twenty-nine other people. Before I say more, I want to tell you about some of the people with me.\nFirst there was a knight, a good man who fought well and knew many different countries. He was a true friend to everyone, and always helped people when they needed it. His clothes were old, dark, and dirty from many years of fighting.\nThen there was a businessman with an expensive hat on his head. The man, who looked wealthier than he truly was, always said, \"I'm doing very well.\" A very quick thinker, he talked about ships and the sea a lot, and showed much interest in changing money from different countries.\nAfter the businessman came a franklin   with a white beard. He asked people from near and far to visit him at home as he liked eating and drinking and having a good time with others. He was an important man, he knew right from wrong, and people listened to him.\nThere was a woman from Bath. Her face was open, and nice-looking, but she couldn't hear very well. In her red dress, she was a big woman with a big smile and big teeth, laughing a lot and talking easily. She knew all about love.\nSo there we were, all thirty of us, at the inn. The landlord, a tall fat man, brought us the best dinner in London. He would also join our journey tomorrow. After we finished eating, the landlord smiled, suggesting \"We're going to Canterbury tomorrow, and that's four days from here. One by one, let's all tell a story on the road to make the time go quicker. And to the teller of the best story we can give a free dinner here at my inn when we get back. What do you say?\" We all said \"yes\" happily to him. Then the question for us was: _ ?",
