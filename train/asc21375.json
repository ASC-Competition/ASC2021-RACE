  "article": "We always use body language in our daily life. When we have a talk with someone, we may use more body language than words. However, the same body language may mean different things in different countries. That's why people sometimes do not understand each other correctly. Pointing to one part of the body can mean differently in different cultures. For example, in the USA people point to their heads when they think someone is clever. However, in Europe it means \"He or she is stupid or something is wrong with his or her head\" .In China, nodding heads means \"Yes\" and shaking heads means \"No\". However, in parts of Greece and Turkey, they mean just the opposite. In England or the USA, when you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb  and the second finger, it means \"Everything is OK.\" However, if you do this in France or Belgium, it means \"You're worth zero.\" In Greece or Turkey, you should not make this gesture, or you are thought to be very rude.\nThe meaning of gestures can also change over time. In the 1960s, the V sign meant \"peace\". However, during World War II, it meant \"victory\". In Greece, it is a very insulting  sign.\nThough the meaning of body language is different, there are some expressions having the same meaning throughout the world.",
