You happened to be in the village. You hid while they looked for you. Will you tell us how you felt when they were looking for you?\" Napoleon looked very angry. He called in two of his soldiers. Then he pointed to the door. The soldiers took the innkeeper and his wife out into the yard.\nAt the end of the yard was a wall. The innkeeper and his wife were led to the wall. The soldiers tied the hands of the innkeeper and his wife. Napoleon watched, saying nothing. \"Please, sir.\" begged the innkeeper, \"Don't kill us! we meant nothing!\" The soldiers moved back. The innkeeper saw them raising their guns. Then Napoleon called: \"Ready! Aim!\" The wife screamed. \"Stop!\" said Napoleon.
