  "article": "Saber Miresmailli was on vacation in London when, caught in a bit of traffic on London Bridge, he decided to take a photo of Tower Bridge.\n\"I noticed the couple,\" he said. \"At that moment, I did not see anyone from the wedding party or a photographer with the couple, so I took several pictures. Usually, my pictures are not very good given the fact that I don't use flash and I don't stop to compose  --so when we get back after two weeks, I was very surprised to find this one turned out so well.\"\nMiresmailli said, \"I thought to myself, if it was me getting married, I would have wanted the picture.\"\nSo he posted the photo on Facebook and attached a few friends with the hope of finding the couple and passing them the picture. What happened next, he said, \"was crazy.\"\n\"I received more than 2,000 requests from perfect strangers and lots of positive and negative emails.\" Until this afternoon, almost 230,000 people had shared his Facebook post on the photo.\nThere's also been an uncertain identification of the couple. It's likely that their names are Laura and James. \"If it's the right couple,\" Miresmailli said, \"they are on their honeymoon in Bali and have no idea about the photo. I believe they will be shocked to find out about their fame\".\nMiresmailli said he's been drowned by the interest in the photo.\n\"I just want to give them their picture and go back to work and tend my tomatoes,\" he said.",
