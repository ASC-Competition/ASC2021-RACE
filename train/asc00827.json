  "article": "Summer is slipping away from me.Some days, it makes me want to cry.Other days, I feel a sense of expectation within me just thinking about fall that makes me want to burst.Tonight, all five of us were in the family room doing our own things.\nAt this moment, my littlest kid is my number one trouble and my number one joy.He has a tooth on the way and although it's such a tiny thing, it's causing so much grief.I'm holding him a lot and I'm not going to lie.I live for his afternoon nap  so I'm able to actually get dressed and use the restroom.\nThe big E is starting school soon.The other day, I found myself a bit depressed about the end of summer and the beginning of another school year.I looked out of our front window with eyes that were heavy and a bit teary.Then, I suddenly realized just how silly this end of summer depression of mine is.I can't change time.But, I can change my emotions and my thoughts.I decided not to spend my final days of summer vacation walking around with a sad face.I decided to hug the last few days of summer and remind myself that before I know it, we will be back in our school routine and all will go well.\nThis week we plan on meeting teachers.I'm taking my girl to have her nails done before her first day of kindergarten.We want to bake a few dozen cookies.We'll take our evening walks as usual and stay up late.And last but not least, I'll get school clothes ready, I'll pack lunches and write lunch notes, we'll read \"The Kissing Hand,\" like we normally do, and I'll tuck  my third grader and kindergartener in their little beds before the big first day.\nThank you summer, you've been warm and wonderful, you've been sweet and sticky, you've been refreshing and exactly what we need.And your sunsets have been amazing, so thank you.",
