  "article": "TAIBEI - Increasing numbers of Taiwanese students are joining the island's \"China rush\", seeking education on the Chinese mainland.\nAccording to official Chinese figures, the number of Taiwanese students admitted into college and postgraduate programs on the mainland totaled 461 in 1996, 928 in 1997 and 839 in 1998.Although no latest official numbers were available,\" Netbig.com Said this number had risen between 30 to 50 percent annually in the past two years with well over 1000 entering mainland campuses last year.\nThe Internet site, based in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, provides education service and information on Chinese mainland colleges and universities. \"Many Taiwanese believe a Chinese education giving more knowledge about the people and culture in the mainland will increase their chances in the Chinese job market, Net.com vice-president Ingrid Huang said.\"I believe _ will give me hands-on experience in the business field in the Chinese mainland and a better understanding of the Chinese mainland people,\" said Lydia Chang, a 19-year-old majoring in journalism at Shih Shin University. Chang plans to go on to get a master's degree in business administration in Shanghai, which she says offers the best environment for such studies.\nA journalism graduate student, surnamed Lin, at the National Taiwan University said he would like to study law on the Chinese mainland since \"there will be better career prospects now that more Taiwanese companies are going there\". \"They hope the children could build up connections which could later become useful in their business operations,\" said Yang Ching-yao, professor of the Chinese mainland studies. A Netbig.com survey showed the campuses favored by Taiwan students included Beijing, Qinghua and Renmin universities in Beijing, and Jinan and Zhongshan universities in Guangzhou. The most popular studies were law, business and Chinese medicine.\nAt present, Chinese Taibei doesn't recognize diplomas earned in the Chinese mainland nor help with any inquiries about studying there. But recognizing the trend, education authorities are giving a final form to a policy accepting certificates from selected universities.",
