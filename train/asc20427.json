Write down special tasks, activities and important dates on a calendar. This helps you remember things you need to do. You can also make a chart. Then, use colorful pens to circle or draw a line under your homework, reading tasks or other activities. By using a chart, you learn how to plan for your studies.\n* Buy folders   in different colors. Put your notebooks in different folders according to the subject. This helps you keep papers and notes organized.\n* Books are great friends. Visit the bookstore or library every few weeks to find a new book to read. The more you get excited about reading, the more confident you will become.\n* Join all kinds of clubs or sports. It's important to communicate with teenagers outside of school.
