But what kind of volunteering should you do?\nFirstly, think about what you enjoy. What are you interested in? What do you want to be when you grow up? For example, if you love animals, you can volunteer to care for abandoned  pets or injured wildlife. If you want to grow up to be a doctor or a nurse, you can look for a youth volunteer program at a local hospital.\nSecondly, think about what you're good at. What skills do you have? What kinds of jobs do you do best? Try to find a volunteer position that will let you make the most of your strengths and talents. For example, if you're a great speaker, then you could try educating others about a problem you care about. If you're a cook, you might find a way to help feed hungry people in your area.\nThirdly, look for what your own community needs. What should be improved in your town, city, or school? What types of volunteer projects would do the most good? For example, if there are a lot of homeless people in your area, you could raise money to help them. If your town has empty areas filled with dirt or rubbish, you could organize or join a group to plant trees and flowers to make these areas more attractive.\nThe problems of the world, or even just of your community, might seem gigantic. Some people might even feel like there's no point trying to do anything, since what they can contribute seems so small. But every person is important, and can do some good and make a difference. Like you!",
