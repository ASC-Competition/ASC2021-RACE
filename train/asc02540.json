  "article": "The Children's Book-Show Competition is a chance for young readers to be writers.\nReading, it seems, is coming back in fashion, if a survey by the famous National Literacy Trust (the NLT) is true. It shows that the percentage of children who admit enjoying reading has grown for the first time in the past 8 years.\nSo it's a good time to launch a competition that includes a shed-load of new books for schools as prizes. The Children's Book-show Competition, _ by The Independent, is taking to the roads again from the start of next term, with a nation-wide tour of 15 big cities, featuring a line-up of a dozen children's writers and illustrators aiming to persuade pupils to follow their footsteps.\nThe competition, launched by the children's writer and illustrator Jessica Souhami, has two categories: the under-nine's and nine to 13-year-olds.\nChildren are asked to choose their favorite fairy or folk tale and set it in an extraordinary place.\nThen they are to retell it with the aid of drawings and writings-whether it is set at sea, on a distant planet, in the future or in the past. The closing date for the competition is 30th November.\n\"Tell your tale in pictures and in words, \"say the organizers of the competition. \"It can be in a picture book or comic-book format.\"\nThe winner of each competition will receive a signed copy of a book by each of the 12 authors involved in this year's tour, plus PS150 worth of books for their school. The runners-up will receive a signed copy of Souhami's new book.",
