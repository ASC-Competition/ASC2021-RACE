  "article": "Eating a diet high in processed  food increases the risk of depression , research suggests. What's more, people who ate plenty of vegetables, fruit and fish actually had a lower risk of depression, the University College London team found.\nData on diet among 3,500 middle-aged civil servants were compared with their emotional state five years later, a British journal reported. They split the participants into two types of diet--those who ate a diet largely based on whole food,which includes lots of fruit, vegetables and fish,and those who ate a mainly processed food diet, such as sweetened desserts, fried food, processed meat,refined  grains and high fat dairy products After accounting for factors such as gender, age, education, physical activity, smoking habits and chronic  diseases, they found a significant difference in the future depression risk with the different diets.\nThose who ate the most wholefood  had a 26% lower risk of future depression than those who ate the least wholefood. By contrast, people with a diet high in processed food had a 58% higher risk of depression than those who ate a diet low in processed foods.\nStudy author Dr. Archana Singh Manoux pointed out there was a chance that the finding could be explained by lifestyle factor they had not accounted for.  He also pointed in a paper that a Mediterranean  diet was associated  with a lower risk of depression, but the problem with that is if you live in Britain, the likelihood  of you eating a Mediterranean diet is not very high.\nDr.Andrew McCulloeh, chief executive of the Mental Health Foundation, said, this study adds to an existing body of solid research that shows the strong links between what we eat and our mental health.\nHe added people's diets were becoming increasingly unhealthy. The UK population is consuming  less nutritious, fresh produce and more saturated  fats and sugars.",
