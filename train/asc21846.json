  "article": "The moon looks bigger than stars at night. But in fact, it is smaller than any stars. The moon looks big to us, because it is closer to us than the stars. The moon goes round the earth. It makes one trip about four weeks. The moon is round and looks beautiful. Now people know quite a lot about the moon. There is no air or water on the moon, so there are not any trees or animals or people on it. The moon gets its light from the sun, but some places on the moon are quite dark. It's very cold at night.",
