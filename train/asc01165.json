  "article": "What benefits can you have from a film? A well-made film offers a whole world of things to watch. First there are the story aspects -- the plot,characters, dialogue and themes. Then there are the technical aspects -- the camera work, cuttings and special effects. And there are many other things, like the credits, musical score and the acting. _  .\nFilms are a means of communication. They can tell you things, just as newspapers do, or television,or any other means of communication. Sometimes they communicate important things to you, like ideasor lifestyles or ways of looking at the world. Sometimes people are aware of this, and sometimes not.The more you are aware of this, the better you are.\nNotice, for example, the way films sometimes affect fashion. A star dresses or wears her hair in a certain way, and suddenly everyone is imitating   her. Boys in the 1950s could sometimes be seen wearingblack leather jackets, idling   on street corners and smoking cigarettes. They were imitating Marion Brando.  His films taught them a certain way to behave.\nFilms can also teach politics. In Star Wars, the heroes were a bunch of lovable incompetents   fighting with guts   and not much else. They were, in fact, rather like the British in the early days of WW II. Their enemies, like the Nazis, had a big advantage in equipment and numbers of troops, and they were like the Nazis in discipline and heartlessness too. The whole film, in fact, was a re-run   of WW II,  and taught values like faith and love of liberty. This is all to the good, but the point is, did you notice it?",
