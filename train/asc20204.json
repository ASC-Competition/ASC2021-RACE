  "article": "Joe and his friends were on their way to the Red Cross Headquarters to take the test for the first- aid badge .They had worked and practiced very hard the whole year and were confident that they would do well for their test.\nOn their way to the test place, they saw a hit - and - run accident. A taxi driver had sped through the red light and almost hit a schoolboy, However, he could not stop in time to avoid a motorcycle that had turned round the corner. The passenger at the back was thrown off the motorcycle and landed heavily on the ground. The taxi driver was frightened and drove off.\nEveryone on the street was greatly surprised.\nJoe realized that they should take action when he saw the victim bled heavily. \"Come on,\" he said to his friends and wanted them to follow him but they didn't move.\nJoe knew what they were thinking.  They would have to wait for another year if they were to miss the test. \"Which is more important? A man's life or a badge?\" Joe asked his friends.\nThe question made his friends feel small.\nThe victim had a deep cut on his head. Joe and his friends dressed his wound to stop the bleeding while waiting for the hospital car to arrive. This was what the Red Cross Society had trained them for.",
