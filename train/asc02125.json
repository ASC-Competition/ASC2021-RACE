Two? or One?\nWith a phonecard you can make up to 200 calls without any change at all.\n1. _ \nGo to a telephone box marked \"Phonecard\". Put in your card to start, make your call and when you have finished, a screen tells you how much is left on your card.\nIt costs no extra for the cards, and the calls cost 10p per unit, the same as any other pay-phone call.\nYou can buy them in units of 10, 20, 40, 100 or 200.\n2. _ \nNear each phonecard place you will find a shop where you can buy one. They're at bus, train and city tube stations.\nAt many universities, hospitals and clubs, restaurants and gas stations on the highway and shopping centers.\nAt airports and seaports.\n3. _ \nMost broken payphones are like that because they've been damaged. There are no coins in a cardphone to excite thieves' interest in it. So you're not probably to find a broken one.\nGet a phonecard yourself and try it out. Or get a bigger wallet.",
