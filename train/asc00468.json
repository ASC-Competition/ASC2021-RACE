  "article": "Did you know that reading can keep your mind active and engaged well into old age?\nSeveral years ago when I was working as a newspaper reporter, I interviewed a woman who was a resident at a local nursing home. She was 100 years old. She read at least one book per week, mostly novels. She was bright, intelligent and fun to talk with.\n\"I love to read. It helps me keep up with what's going on in the world,\" she said. \"A friend of mine brings me a new book every week. I look forward to her visits and I look forward to the books.\"\n\"I can't get around much any more,\" said the 100-year-old woman, \"but when I read, I can go anywhere, anytime I want. And no one has to help me!\"\nReading also sets a good example for younger generations. I have observed that the best readers are those students who see their parents reading. And I'm not talking about only reading novels. Newspapers and magazines are important too. Your actions will communicate a great deal to your children and grandchildren about what you value.\nBut why is reading so important? In this day and age, with television to give us news, and movies and videos to keep us entertained, who needs to read?\nThe answer is everyone.\nDeveloping good reading skills does not only mean that you can read a novel or a magazine, it also means being able to read and understand things like a credit card contract or an insurance policy, or the instructions for how to put a new printer to use with your computer. In addition, developing good reading skills means that you can think for yourself. You can read about the advantages and disadvantages of anything from homeschooling to taking a vacation to Ireland. And then you can make up your own mind about what's best for you and your family.",
