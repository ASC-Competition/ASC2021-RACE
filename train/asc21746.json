  "article": "Earthquakes may happen anywhere on the earth. When some plates  of the earth move suddenly, an earthquake happens. Many earthquakes begin under the sea. They often happen near the mountains  , too.\nDuring an earthquake, the shakings make rocks rise suddenly and even crack  open. Houses fall, people are killed or hurt, and sometimes the whole villages or cities are destroyed .\nCan we do something to keep ourselves safe from earthquakes? Scientists have studied earthquakes and made maps that show the \"earthquake belts\". In areas in these belts, it's possible for earthquakes to happen. In these areas we should build strong houses to fight against   earthquakes.\nIn the future, scientists will be able to tell when and where an earthquake will be before they happen. They can also tell people what to do and how to do it.",
