  "article": "As we all know, getting benched in sports is usually a bad thing. But at one school in Florida, a girl has taken a bench and turned it into something entirely different - a place to find friends. It's called the Friendship Bench. And it's the brainchild of a sixth grader at Palm Bay Elementary - a girl named Acacia Woodley.\nAcacia's attitude toward life might be summed up best by a question she recently asked members of the Brevard County School Board - \"what if we spend as much time putting the spotlight on kindness as we do on cruelty?\" It's a philosophy Acacias has learned to live her own life -despite having a lot of people would consider a handicap. She was born without a right hand. And her left hand did not form properly. But Acacia says that she has not stopped her from achieving her goals. \"You need to believe in your dreams. If you don't believe in you dreams, I can definitely tell you that they are not going to come true.\" She said.\nAcacia came up with the idea for the Friendship Bench after seeing kids getting bullied at school. She says she has also experienced bullying herself - kids whispering about her or picking on her because she is different. \"Some people say they feel sorry for me. I tell them not to,\" she said. \"I don't care that I'm different. I like being different.\"\nThe Friendship Bench looks like a lot of other benches. It has arm sets and a place to lean on. But there are also words painted on it - words such as \"hope\", \"respect\", \"listen\" and \"dream\". Acacia put the benches together with the help from her mother and brother.\nAny time a kid feels he or she needs a friend, all that kid needs to do is sit on the bench. It is then up to the other kids - or grown-ups - to fill that need. \"It's a perfect idea,\" Palm Bay Elementary Principal Lori said. \"It's something we've needed so badly.\"\nThe Friendship Bench has been such a success at Palm Bay Elementary that other schools are now interested in installing one too. \"There's a saying in my teacher's classroom,\" Acacia said. \"It says, 'it you can dream it, you can achieve it.'\"",
