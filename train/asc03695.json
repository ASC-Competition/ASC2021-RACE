  "article": "Thailand's capital Bangkok is both attractive and wonderful, a city of glass towers and concrete buildings crowded with nearly 10 million people. The ground beneath is spongy  and moist. Imagine a brick resting on top of a birthday cake. That's Bangkok-and it's sinking into the Earth at an alarming rate.\nThailand's disaster specialists have been warning of this coming disaster for years. One expert has said he's worried about Bangkok resembling Atlantis. Another previously told Global post that the city will be under five feet of water by 2030. The latest estimates suggest that Bangkok is now sinking as fast as two centimeters per year in parts of the city. The predictions for 2100 are even more terrible. By then , Bangkok will be fully submerged and unlivable.\nLike global warming, which will accelerate the city's submersion by raising the sea leavel, Bangkok's sinking problems are repeatedly _ But the monsoon season, currently underway, tends to bring this crisis to mind. A nasty storm can suddenly turn Bangkok's streets into gushing streams. Sewers overflow, taxis move through dirty water and, occasionally, kids can pick up displaced fish.\nAnond Snidvongs, director of the Southeast Asia Regional Research Center, predicts the city's outskirts will be the first to go. Parts of the shoreline ebyong Bangkok are already liend with pumps that make noises and help to transform invading seawater. They don't always work. During heavy rains, salt water flows in the streets of the city.\nBangkok is swallowed up a little more each day. Experts tend to offer two solutions. The first is to pu up a massive seawall that could cost nearly $3 billion-nearly 1 percent of Thailand's current GDP. The second option is to give up entirely and move the capital to higher ground.",
