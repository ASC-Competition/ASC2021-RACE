  "article": "Who needs guard dogs when you have wolves , right? That's probably what Kazakh villagers in the Almaty region though when they decided to replace their dogs with the fierce forest dwelling beasts. According to local news reports, taming  wolves is now the latest trend and a sort of hobby among rural Kazakhs.\nNurseit Zhylkyshybay, a farmer from the south-eastern Almaty region, told reporters that he purchased a wolf cub from hunters three years ago, and the animal is now perfectly tamed.\nKurtka, Nurseit's pet wolf, lives in the family's yard and takes long walks through the village with his master. \"He's never _ ,\" Nurseit insisted. \"I rarely put him on a chain and do take him for regular walks around the village. Our family and neighbors aren't scared of him at all.\"\nBut wolf expert Almas Zhaparov said that the animals are 'far too dangerous' to keep at home. \"A wolf is like a ticking bomb, it can go off at any moment,\" he warned. \"If nothing is done, the fashion could spread to the wealthy Kazakhs, who might try to keep wolves in the grounds of their houses, with possibly deadly consequences.\" Social media users also expressed worry about the trend, accusing the government for failing to limit the practice.\nNevertheless, the wolves don't seem to be posing an immediate threat. If visuals from news reports are anything to go by, the beasts look pretty happy with their new lifestyle, and appear quite fond of their new masters, not unlike dogs.",
