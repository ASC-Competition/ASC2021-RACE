  "article": "A very young boy, Tom, lives a long way from the city. One day he goes to the city to visit his friend, Jack. Jack asks Tom to have lunch together. They go into the restaurant and sit down at a table. Tom looks around and he sees some old people put eye glasses on before reading their books, so after lunch he goes to a shop to buy some glasses, too. He walks along the road, and soon finds a shop. The man in the shop makes him try on a lot of glasses, but Tom always says, \"No, I can't read with these.\"\nThe man in the shop becomes more and more puzzled  . At last he says, \"Excuse me, but can't you read at all?\"\n\"No, I can't.\" Tom says, \"If I can read, do you think I come here to buy glasses?\"",
