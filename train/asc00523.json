  "article": "A very close friend phoned me this weekend and asked a specific question about earning a few extra dollars each month online. For the benefit of keeping her name and details secret, I will call her Annie in this article. You see Annie suffers from a severe form of inaction syndrome ; she is full of great ideas that never materialize into cash and she is having a problem finding the link that will achieve this.\nSomebody once said that knowledge is power, yet we constantly find from readers of our website that they have knowledge to burn and still do not have power. Just look at the academics in universities all around the world; they have so much knowledge that they should control the wealth of the world. In truth they work for peanuts and very few of them ever achieve the power of independence. So knowledge certainly isn't power. Therefore, we should change that \"wise\" statement to: \"Power is the ability to use knowledge to your own benefit.\"\nThat paragraph was inserted because Annie is a typical academic--strong on talk and plans but a little weaker on actions. In the period of a twenty-minute conversation, she expounded a whole list of plans and ideas to make the extra few hundred dollars each month she was seeking. Any one of her many ideas was a potential money maker, but she had taken action on none of them. At one time she said, \"I'm lost as to what to do next.\"\nThat was my cue to get involved. \"Take action,\" I advised.\nAll that is wrong is that Annie was inactive without knowing it. In five minutes we drew up a plan of action and agreed to talk again in a month to review progress. When we finished the conversation, she sounded much happier and more motivated than when we started. Annie just needs a little _ into beneficial action.",
