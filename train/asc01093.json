  "article": "Most people know the feeling when you walk into a lift  with other people. A study has found that where people stand is based on their social position on entering the lift.\nRebekah Rousi, a Ph.D. student, did a study of lift behavior in two of the tallest office buildings in Adelaide, Australia. As part of her research, she took a total of 30 lift rides in the two buildings, and discovered there was a fixed order about where people chose to stand.\nIn her research paper, she wrote that more senior men seemed to walk straight towards the back of the lift. She said , \"in front of them were younger men, and in front of them were women of all ages.\" She also noticed there was a difference in the direction where people look during the ride. \"Men watched the monitors, looked in the side mirrors (in one building) to see themselves, and in the door mirrors (in the other building) to watch others. Women would watch the monitors and avoid looking into others' eyes (unless in conversations) and the mirrors.\"\nRebekah Rousi concluded that shyer people stand toward the front, where they can't see other passengers, while fearless people stand in the back, where they have a good view of everyone else.",
