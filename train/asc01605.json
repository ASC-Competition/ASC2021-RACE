  "article": "Starting from April, 2010, you won't be hearing the word \"NBA\" on sports programs on CCTV. Instead, sport host will give the full Chinese name when they refer to the NBA - National Basketball Association. You also won't hear any other English abbreviations   on CCTV's Chinese programs, such as GDP (gross domestic product), or WTO (World Trade Organization). You will hear their Chinese translations.\nCCTV received a notice from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television telling it to avoid using English-language abbreviations in their reports to protect the \"purity\" of the Chinese language. A few other TV stations also received the notice.\nFu Zhenguo, an editor of People's Daily, is one of the people who suggested the change. \"Firstly, using English in a Chinese-speaking environment is against Chinese law,\" he said. \"Then, using English on Chinese TV programs is unfair to people who don't understand English. What's worse, it will have a bad language influence on kids and teenagers.\"\nA lot of netizens have criticized the move, saying that it will cause problems for them.\n\"I understand what CD, VCD and DVD mean when I hear them. But I won't know what the TV programs are talking about if I hear those products' full Chinese names,\" a netizen wrote in a BBS post. Following the same post, another netizen wrote jokingly: \"I'm not listening to my MP3 now. I'm listening to my Moving Picture Experts Group-1 Audio Layer 3  .\"",
