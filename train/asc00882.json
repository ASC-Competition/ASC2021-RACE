  "article": "Not being able to fall asleep or stay asleep is not a disorder in itself but a sign of some other problems, often a physical one.\nIf you have trouble sleeping, the American Sleep Disorders Association suggests that, for a week or two, you put down the time you go to bed, get up, exercise, and drink coffee, tea or wine.  The purpose is to find the habits that may affect your sleep.\nThen:\na.      Don't drink coffee in the six hours before going to bed.\nb.      Stop smoking and drinking at bedtime.\nc.      Don't sleep during the day.\nd.      Go to bed at the same time every night.  Set your alarm clock for the same time every morning and get up at that time, whether or not you sleep well.\ne.      Use the bedroom only for sleep.  Read, watch TV, eat and talk elsewhere.\nf.       Take sleeping pills according to your doctor's directions and don't take them for longer than three weeks at a time.\ng.      If you haven't fallen asleep within 15 minutes of going to bed, don't turn over worrying about it.  Get up and read or watch TV until you are sleepy, then return to bed.\nIf you continue to have trouble sleeping, ask your doctor for help or go to a sleep-disorders center.",
