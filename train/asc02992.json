  "article": "It's not easy growing up. Growing up can be a real \"pain\" for some of us. Sometimes we feel trapped, sometimes we feel sad, sometimes we are fearful, and sometimes we just don't understand why we can't stay young forever. But we should take a look back on all the hardships in life with a positive attitude and learn from them. We must overcome every obstacle one small step at a time. We should realize that all of our growing pains actually turn into growing gains!\nThroughout our lives we are going to face many challenges and pains, but we should never let these _ keep us from following our dreams. We must overcome every obstacle one small step at a time.\nAs a young girl, my parents forced me to do so many things that I didn't like. They made me learn to play the violin and then the piano. At that time I hated music and I also hated them. But looking back now, I am so glad that my parents encouraged me to take music lessons. Music hasenriched  my life in so many ways. I now realize that my parents and teachers wanted me to have a better life than they did themselves.\nWe are all going to experience growing pains, but they are just part of our life. They might seem so huge at the time, but we must be strong. Think about how we would feel if we had no challenges and lived a life like that. Life would be really boring and meaningless. The future is ours! A little hard work and sweat never hurt anyone! If we realize that these pains are just smallbumps  on our road to success, we will realize that our growing pains are actually growing gains!",
