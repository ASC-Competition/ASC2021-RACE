Or if you are interested in something you always have to master it first.\nWhen I was ten, I came over to my cousin's house, and that was pain because he lived in New York and I lived in Miami. So I came over every summer break by myself, of course I had my parents' permission to go that far.\nOne day, We decided to head to the forest. I was looking forward to this trip because I knew that my cousin was an expert on tree climbing while I was not. So, as we walked closer and closer to the forest, I became _ because I did not possess the ability to climb trees. When he started climbing a tree I was upset but I joined him hoping not to break my neck. Last Summer break he invited me to his house. I was afraid of climbing to the tree so I gave up. But this time I tried climbing the tree. While I was climbing I was so scared like I was about to die at any moment. But when I was about to climb on the other branch I lost my balance. Luckily I got hold on one of the bottom branches.  My cousin suddenly started climbing down and tried to help me. After he put me on the ground, he ran to get some help. The pain was just killing me, I lost a lot of blood and I knew that I have to be awake to survive.\nFinally, my cousin brought the help. When I waked up I was happy that I did not die. It was pretty insane what happened to me. ( 295 words )",
