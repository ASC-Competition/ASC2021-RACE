  "article": "If boy wizard Harry Potter uses his magic to capture   the hearts of millions of teenagers, high school students Gabriella and Troy have charmed American boys and girls with their stories of campus life.\nThey are the leading characters in High School Musical, a series of hugely successful films in the US. The sequel  , High School Musical 3, came out on October 24 and has topped the American box office for two straight weeks.\nThe show has everything attractive to teenagers -- dancing, catchy music, puppy love and good looks. The story starts when high school basketball star Troy and brainy Gabriella -- _ -- meet during the winter break. At a karaoke contest they discover their love for singing and an interest in each other. When school starts, Troy finds out that Gabriella is the new girl at his school.\nEager to find the magic they had during karaoke, Troy and Gabriella decide to audition   for the school's upcoming musical. This angers the school's drama queen Sharpay. However, they overcome difficulties and become the leading actors.\nBut the story doesn't end there. High School Musical 2 follows their adventures over summer vacation when Sharpay tires to break up Troy and Gabriella. In the latest sequel, high-school seniors are facing the possibilities of being separated from each other as they go off in different directions when graduating from high school.\nJoined by the rest of their friends, Troy and Gabriella stage a musical reflecting their experiences, hopes and fears about the future.\n\"The success of the High School Musical films shows Disney's long-term efforts to attract youngsters for whom Mickey Mouse seems to babyish,\" wrote New York Times reporter Dave Itzkoff. \"For the time being, the movie has made fictional high school students as recognizable as that 79-year-old mouse.\"",
