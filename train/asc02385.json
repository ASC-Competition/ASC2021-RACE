  "article": "Ever since I started my freshman year in another state, I've realized that people make many assumptions about college students, many of which are based on partying. Even my sociology professor jokingly told our class: \"If your motto isn't 'I am partying therefore I am,' you're college-ing wrong.\"\nWhenever I say partying isn't fun, I get the same response: wide-eyed stares, dropped jaws and a resounding \"Seriously?\", which makes me feel like I'm being judged.\nDon't get me wrong - I've tried to enjoy dancing in hot, crowded spaces to loud rap music. But at last, I've always escaped to an empty corner while trying to ignore rude, crazy people. I wondered if I was weird for wanting to stay in on a Friday night to read a book. I even questioned whether or not I was living the \"authentic \" college experience.\n\"Maybe you - a shy boy - just need to go out more.\" Friends have said. Suggestions like these make me think about food. Have you ever tasted something that someone else really likes and you don't? When that happens to me, I have a habit of eating more hoping that it will eventually taste good. Does that ever work? No.\nFor me, partying is a lot like that. From what I can tell, I'm just not a fan. I'm not trying to set myself apart - I just have a different definition of fun.\nAs you begin to think about your present college life, I hope this helps you realize that there isn't just one way to experience college life. Some turn up at a party to relax. I turn to a good book. Which option have you made in college? And remember: college is a place where you can keep yourself originally. It means not going with the flow and means figuring out what you want for yourself, originating your own values and thinking a way towards your future success.",
