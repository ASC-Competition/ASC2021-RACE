  "article": "An artist went to a beautiful part of the country for a holiday, and stayed with a farmer. Every day he went out with his paints and brushes and painted from morning to evening, and then when it got dark, he went back to the farm and had a good dinner before he went to bed.\nAt the end of his holiday he wanted to pay the farmer, but the farmer said, \"No, I don't want money... but give me one of your pictures. What is money? In a week it will all be finished, but your painting will still be here.\"\nThe artist was very pleased and thanked the farmer for saying such kind things about his pictures. The farmer smiled and answered, \"It's not that. I have a son in London. He wants to become an artist. When he comes home next month, I'll show him your picture, and he will not want to be an artist any more, I think. \"",
