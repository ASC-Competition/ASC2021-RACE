  "article": "Are there any foreigners in your city? How do you address  them in English when you want to talk to these foreigners? The following may be some simple rules the beginners should follow.\n1. When talking to strangers there is often no special form of address in English. In most cases, if you want to catch the attention of a stranger it is necessary to use such phrases as \"Excuse me\".\n2. In British English \"Sir\" and \"Madam\" are considered to be too formal for most situations. They are used mostly to customers in shops or restaurants .While in American English \"Sir\" and \"Madam\" are not so formal and are commonly used between strangers, especially with older people whose names you don't know.\n3. When you talk to some people you know, you can use their names directly. If you are friends, use their first names; if your relationship is more formal, use \"Mr.\", \"Mrs.\", \"Ms.\", etc, before their family names.\n4. There are many other forms of address which can be used between friends and strangers. However, many of these are limited in use. For example, \"pal\" and \"mate\" can be used between strangers, but are usually only used by men talking to other men.\nIf you meet foreigners, do remember not to address them in wrong ways.",
