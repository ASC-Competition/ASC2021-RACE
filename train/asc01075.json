  "article": "Justin Bieber may have millions of fans worldwide, but Russia's bears don't appear to admire the pop singer's music --- which proved fortunate for one lucky fisherman.\nIgor Vorozhbitsyn had his life saved by a Justin Bieber ringtone, when his mobile phone went off during a dangerous attack by a brown bear.\nThe 42-year-old was attacked as he was walking to a favourite fishing spot in northern Russia's Yakutia Republic and firmly believed that he was going to be killed.\nWildlife experts believe the ringtone must have frightened the bear into stopping its attack.\n'Sometimes a sharp shock can stop an angry bear in its attack and that ringtone would be a very unexpected sound for a bear,' explained one.\nMr Vorozhbitsyn suffered from cuts and severe wounds and was rescued when he was found by other fishermen after using the phone to call for help.\nMr Vorozhbitsyn ---now recovering from his wounds---explained: 'I had parked my car and was walking towards the spot I'd marked out when there was a tremendous impact on my back and the bear was on top of me.'\n'I couldn't believe my luck when the phone went off and it run away.'\n'I know that sort of ringtone isn't to everyone's taste but my granddaughter loaded it onto my phone for a joke,' he added.\nAdult brown bears can weigh as much as 600kg and have been known to kill wolves and even Siberian tigers.\nFinally, this is a proof that Justin Bieber is unbearable",
