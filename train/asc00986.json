  "article": "When my daughter Sally was five, I bought Grimm's Fairy Tales and read Snow White to her one night. At the end of the original Grimm tale, Snow White's stepmother is made to put on red-hot iron shoes and dance until she falls down dead.\nThis came as something of a shock. I always thought fairytales had happy endings. And I didn't want my five-year-old daughter going to sleep thinking: \"Thank goodness they tortured   that old woman to death.\" That's when I decided to write fairy tales.\nIn the years that followed, I wrote tales non-stop and read them to Sally at bedtime. The Corn Dolly was based on a child who was always complaining; The Silly King was just a silly story Sally loved; I wrote The Witch and the Rainbow Cat for Sally because of her enormous  appetite for stories about witches while Dr Bonocolus's Devil is a new version of the Faust legend.\nNifobobinus, however, was different. I wrote this book when Sally was older and took up all things girls have to do -- who's friends with who, who stuck a sticker on the back of whose boyfriend, or whatever thing she felt funny.\nNicobobinus, the boy who could do anything, came out of my desire for a more innocent world. He lived a 1ong time ago, in a city called Venice. Only his best friend, Rosie, knew he could, and nobody took any notice of anything Rosie said, because she was always having wild ideas anyway.\nNicobobinus was so different that it turned out to be an instant hit. The Times called me \"an author setting out to _ the classic fairytales\". I asked Sally what she thought of Nicobobinus. She said it was her favourite.",
