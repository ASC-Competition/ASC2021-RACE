  "article": "You may know May Day, but do you know Lei Day? Like May Day, Lei Day is also celebrated   on May 1st. People wear leis   on this day. A lei is a big circle usually made of flowers . On Lei Day, people give leis to each other. Where do you know this holiday is celebrated? Hawaii, of course! People give leis on birthdays, weddings   and as a way to say \"I love you\". In 1928, a writer, Don Blanding, wrote an article saying that this tradition should become a holiday. Another writer, Grace Tower Warren, thought of the idea of celebrating this day on May 1st and said, \"May Day is Lei Day.\"On this day in 1928, people wore leis and celebrated with music, dancing and a lei-making competition. The next year, Lei Day became a public   holiday. Today, people still celebrate Lei Day in Hawaii. We hope they all have a happy May Day and a happy Lei Day!",
