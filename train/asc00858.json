  "article": "Arabs consider it extremely bad manners to start talking business immediately. Even the busiest government official always takes extra time to be polite and offer refreshments  . No matter how busy you are, you should make time for this.\nThe conference visit is a way of doing business throughout the Arab world. Frequently, you will have to discuss your business in the presence of strangers, who may or may not have anything to do with your business. Do not be surprised if your meeting is interrupted several times by people who come into the room unannounced, whisper, or speak softly to the person with whom you are talking, and leave. Act as though you do not hear, and never show displeasure at being interrupted.\nMaking decisions quickly is not an Arab custom. There is a vagueness   in doing business in the Middle East which will puzzle a newcomer. Give yourself lots of time and ask lots of questions.\nWhen an Arab says \"yes\", he may mean \"maybe\". When he says \"maybe\", he probably means \"no\". You will seldom get a direct \"no\" from an Arab because it is considered not polite. Instead of \"no\", he will say \"inshallah\", which means \"if God is willing\". On the other hand, \"yes\" does not necessarily mean \"yes\". A smile and a slow nod might be like an agreement but in fact your host is being polite. An Arab considers it rude to disagree with a guest.",
