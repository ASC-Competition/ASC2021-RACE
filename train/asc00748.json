  "article": "Everybody knows the saying \"Two steps forward and three steps back\". That described my life pretty well as a single mom. I was raising two teenagers on a teacher's aide's salary. It wasn't nearly enough to cover the bills, so I moonlighted as a waitress. Every time I thought that I had found a solution to my money worries, something would fall through and I would end up feeling worse off than before.\nThe next evening at the restaurant I tried on my apron, wishing I could be home with my kids. I walked up to my first table. Around it was a cheerful older couple. The woman gave me a smile that warmed me. I couldn't help but notice her unusual glass ring. \"What a beautiful ring,\" I said. We chatted for a minute then I took their order and left. When I came back with their drinks, the woman held out her ring. \"I would like to give this to you,\" she said.\n\"Oh, no, I couldn't,\" I said, embarrassed.\nShe gently placed the ring in my hand and closed my fingers around it. \"It's yours,\" she said. \"Please accept it and your things are going to be okay.\" Right there at their table in the middle of the restaurant I broke down in tears. \"Thank you for giving me hope,\" I said.\nLong after that night, that sense of peace stayed with me. I knew the right job would come in time. Nine months later it did. I got a better position at another school and I started waitressing at a restaurant where I was allowed to spend more time with my kids.\nNow in these tough times, I have money worries again, but they don't get me down. I know things will turn out okay. And when I wear that unusual glass ring, I'm reminded I'm not alone.",
