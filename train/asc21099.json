  "article": "Li Lei, Beijing\nI found the summer vacation was not so interesting as I imagined . It was very hot, so I had to spend most of the time staying at home, watching TV, listening to the radio and playing with my dog. Sometimes, I went to visit my relatives .\nGina, New York\nI went to the countryside with my family and stayed there for about two weeks. The air there was nice and clean. Every day, we fed the chickens, milked the cows, played with the dogs and went fishing. We enjoyed ourselves very much. We wished to go there again.\nAlice, London\nMy summer vacation was great. I went to Switzerland  with my friends and stayed there for a week. It wasn't very hot there. We went to a climb the Alps . We felt very tired but excited. We also saw some beautiful lakes, went boating and took many photos.",
