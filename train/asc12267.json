  "article": "Public schools in Washington, D.C. provide students with musical instruments for free. When something goes wrong with an instrument, Charles West and Larry Jernigan do the repairs. Both men approach their work with a passion . For them, it's important that students have a joyful experience with music.\nThe two have worked together for almost 20 years. This year alone, they've fixed about 450 instruments. Both men are musicians and music lovers, so learning to do repairs came naturally.\n\"I have been a musician all my life.\" says West. \"I played in an orchestra here in the city. I majored in music in college. I played in an army band.\"\nJernigan's musical interests are varied. \"I was formerly trained in the piano and guitar. The alto sax, and the flute, I picked up while working here.\"\nIn addition to fixing instruments, the two also go to schools to instruct teachers and students on how to make minor repairs on their own.\nWest believes if children start early and stay concerned with music, it enriches other areas of their lives. \"I see that in other kids. I see it in myself. I have seen it hundreds of times and it works,\" he says. \"They learn teamwork. They learn patience and respect.\"\nBut West has concerns about the future of music in the electronic age.\n\"This instant age has taken away from the sit-down, the patience. And to learn to play an instrument, it takes patience, it takes diligence, it takes time.\"\nBeing able to enjoy music on the job is one of the benefits of the job. Both men agree their best rewards are the students' performances.",
