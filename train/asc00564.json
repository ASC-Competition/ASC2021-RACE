  "article": "Millions of years ago dinosaurs   lived on the earth. In the days of dinosaurs the whole earth was warm and wet. There were green forests and they could find enough to eat. Later, parts of the earth became cold and dry. and the forests there died. Then dinosaurs could not find enough to cat. This must be one reason why dinosaurs died out.\nWe can guess another reason. New kinds of animals came on the earth. Some had big brains and were fast and strong. They could kill dinosaurs. There may be other reasons that we don't know about yet. Scientists are trying to make more discoveries about dinosaurs.\nDinosaurs were of many sizes and shapes  .  Some were as small as chickens, while some were about 90 feet long.\nThere were also terrible fights between dinosaurs. They might have happened more than 100 million years ago. Though there was no man to see any of the fights, we can be told by the animal's footprints   that fight did take place.",
