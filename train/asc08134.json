Years ago he found work in a big city and moved there with his family.\nOn the first Saturday in their new home, Mr. Smith took his new car out of the garage   and washed it. A man came at the moment. When he saw Mr. Smith's new car, he stopped and looked at it for a few minutes. Then Mr. Smith turned and saw him.\nThe man said, \"That's a nice car. Is it yours?\"\n\"Sometimes,\" Smith answered with a smile.\n\"Sometimes?\" The man said. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"Well,\" answered Smith slowly, \"When there's a party in town, it is my daughter's, Mary. When there's a football game, it's my son's, John. After I wash it, and it looks really nice and clean, it's my wife's. And when it needs gas, it's mine.\"",
