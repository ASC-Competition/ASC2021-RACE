  "article": "My friend Karen and I were always together. Karen was only a few months older than I. I always thought she was so beautiful, with long hair and blue eyes. I loved Karen so much because she liked me for being the way I was. I could be myself and share my secrets with her and I never felt like I was being judged.\nWe had so much fun and were really quite silly. One time I asked my mom to make us the same dresses so we could pretend we were twins.\nWe continued as best friends throughout grade school. One day, Karen was going to another friend's place and asked me to come along, but I couldn't go because I had a babysitting job that afternoon. We walked together to the Becker's home where I was to babysit and then she continued on her way without me. We had agreed that I would meet her at the corner when she returned and I finished my job.\nAt four o'clock I rushed to the corner so I wouldn't be late for meeting Karen. Just as I arrived at the corner, I saw Karen crossing the street. In a second it happened. I saw Karen's body fly up in the sky. A car had hit her!\nKaren was on life support for a week before it was decided that they would allow her to go in peace. Karen's parents wanted to donate her organs to the hospital, but there was nothing left healthy enough to be used because she was hit so hard.\nI have never got so close to another person since Karen died. I do miss her! Do you cherish your friends? If you don't, please do, as you may lose them one day.",
