  "article": "Last summer Jenny and her friends had a bus trip to New York. She felt very relaxed on the way. They visited a museum. But it was really crowded there and the display  was not interesting at all. They went to different restaurants to have dinner. Some food was quite delicious, but Jenny thought the fast food was awful. When the weather was fine, they went to the beach to swim. The sea was beautiful, and they had a good time.",
