  "article": "For Kim LeBlanc, knowing that her son Tyler's organs, eyes and other tissues have given life or healing to others is helping her cope with the loss of her child, who was struck by a truck in Guelph on May 31.\nTyler was believed to have been texting a friend when he stepped onto a high-traffic road against the green light and was struck by the truck. Then he was sent to a Hamilton hospital. Surgery was performed to ease the pressure in his brain, but .the family was told he would not recover.\n\"With all of his injuries, I just prayed all night for a miracle. And I was granted a miracle, but not in the way I'd expected,\" says LeBlanc, her voice choked by emotion.\nThe family decided to donate Tyler's organs, a choice she believes her kind and considerate son would have made on his own. It's also a choice that transplant programs wish would be made more often, because the need for donor organs is far more than the supply worldwide. More than 1,500 people in Ontario are on the waiting list for life-saving organs, and one dies every day because an organ has not become available in time. Across Canada, the gap between donations and the need for organs continues to widen. At the end of 2010, more than 4,400 Canadians were on the waiting list for donor organs, including 3,362 needing a kidney. That year, 229 died before the organs they needed became available.\nLeBlanc recalls the morning when her son was taken off life support and his organs were removed. Despite living what she calls a parent's absolute worst nightmare, LeBlanc says she has got the strength to bear such an unbearable loss. \"He's still there. He's still living. And he's still breathing. And he's brought so much joy to families,\" she says. \"He's my hero. He really is my hero.\"",
