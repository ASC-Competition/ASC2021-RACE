When school was over, winds became stronger and it began to rain.\nThe mother of the little girl felt worried that her daughter would be afraid when she walked home from school and that lightning  might make her child scared. Following the bright light of lightning, the mother quickly got into her car and drove to her child's school.\nAs the mother drove along the road, she saw her little girl walking alone in the rain. To her great surprise, she found that when a lightning came, her daughter stopped, looked up and smiled. Another lightning came and then another followed. With each lightning, the little girl stopped, looked up and smiled.\nInside the car, the motherasked her daughter, \"What were you doing? Why did you look up and smile when the lightning came ?\" The little girl answered with a smile, \"Mum, you know, God was looking at me. Each time I felt a little afraid walking in the rain.God would take a picture of me. I knew he was playing a game with me''.",
