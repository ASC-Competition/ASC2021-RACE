  "article": "I can't think of a better way of appreciating a new culture than by taking part in one of its festivals. You'll find that some festivals are celebrated by an entire country, while others may be known only to a single city or region, but either way festivals play an important role in a certain culture. Just enjoy them!\n Tomatina -- Bunol, Spain\nEvery last Wednesday in August, the town of Bunol is filled with tons of tomatoes in the world's biggest food flight. Many people wear goggles   during this hour of great fun, as the town becomes a red river.\n Boryeong Mud Festival -- Boryeong, South Korea\nFor two weeks in July, millions gather in Boryeong to experience the grey pools and slides. What began as a way to help sell the region's mineral-rich mud has turned into a festive party with music and fireworks. The mud is usually only available in cosmetic products  , but here you can cake yourself in grey as you want.\n Holi -- India\nHoli, the Festival of Colors, is a Hindu celebration full of joy and one of India's most important holidays. During the day of the last full moon of the lunar month, usually late February or early March, the air is full of brightly colored powder  . The festival is celebrated differently throughout the country, with bonfires and music, but the cheerful spirit is common among Hindu people around the world.\n International Pillow Fight Day -- Worldwide\nTens of thousands of people took part in the 4th annual International Pillow Fight Day on April 2, 2013. From London to Vancouver to many other cities, the festival is held in more than 100 countries. So just bring a soft pillow in early April, and watch feathers fly.",
