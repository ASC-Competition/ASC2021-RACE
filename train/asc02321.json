  "article": "Have you ever imagined what human beings will look like in the future? Well, now you don't have to.\nAccording to AsapScience, a Canada-based video channel that touches on many different science topics, humans will be very different creatures 1,000 years from now.\nArtificial intelligence, genetic engineering and climate change will work together to change our bodies greatly, according to a video recently published by the channel.\nWe could, for instance, develop red eyes as our DNA changes, and have darker skin because of global warming.\nThe video painted a picture of a future world in which our bodies are part human, part machine. Nanobots, or tiny robots, will be put into our bodies, improving our abilities.\n\"No longer will we be limited by our own physiology. We will truly become a mixture of biology and machine on the inside,\" says the video.\nMeanwhile, designer babies will cause future generations to grow into intelligent, attractive people. As global warming takes hold, humans will also be skinnier and taller, as this body shape deals with heat better.\nIn fact, Cadell Last, a researcher at the Global Brain Institute located in Belgium, believes change may happen even faster than this.\nAs he said in a paper recently published in Current Aging Science, mankind is already going through a major evolutionary change. In less than four decades, Last claims, we will live longer, have children in old age and need artificial intelligence to finish daily tasks.\n\"Your 80 or 100 is going to be so radically different than your grandparents,\" Last said. Instead of living fast and dying young, he believes humans will live slow and die old.\n\"The biological clock isn't going to be around forever,\" he added, and said that people could pause it for some time using future technology.\nJust a few hundred years ago, most humans were working in the fields, while nowadays more and more are getting an education. These are just predictions, and no one can be sure how human beings will evolve in the future. But with such large changes in our environments, it seems likely that we will all look very different one day.",
