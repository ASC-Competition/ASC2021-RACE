  "article": "It was the end of my first day as a waitress in a busy New York restaurant. My cap had gone away, and my feet hurt. The loaded plates I carried seemed to be heavier and heavier. Tired and discouraged, I didn't seem able to do anything right. As I made out a check for a family with several children who had changed their ice-cream order a dozen times, I was ready to stop. Then the father smiled at me as he handed me my tip. \"Well done,\" he said, \"you've looked after us really well.\" Suddenly my tiredness disappeared. I smiled back, and later, when the manager asked me how I'd liked my first day, I said, \"Fine!\" Those few words of praise had changed everything. Praise is like sunlight to human spirit; we cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, most of us are only too ready to apply to others the cold criticism , but are unwilling to give our fellows the warm sunshine of praise. Perhaps that is why one word of praise can bring such pleasure.\nIt's strange how _ we are about praising. Perhaps it's because few of us know how to accept it. It's especially rewarding to give praise in areas in which effort generally goes unnoticed.An artist gets admired for a glorious picture,a cook for a perfect meal.But do you ever tell your laundry  manager how pleased you are when the shirts are done just right? In fact,to give praise costs the giver nothing but a moment's thought and a moment's effort.",
