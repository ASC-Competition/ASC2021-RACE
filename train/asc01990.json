  "article": "The worst earthquake in 40 years shook South Asia on Sunday, starting with horrible waves that swept entire villages into the sea. At least 20,000 people in six countries were killed in the disaster, and millions were left homeless.\nThe quake shook deep beneath the Indonesian island of Sumatra. It was felt more than 3000 miles away in East Africa, where heavy tides kept fishermen at home and resorts closed.\nIt was as if the sea had struck the land. Residents of Sri Lanka, a small island country off the coast of India, ran to the hills to find safety from the tsunami. Many took their radios, televisions, and other valuables with them. The disaster hit Sri Lanka hardest. Of its 20million people, 1 million lost their homes, and 10000 died.\n\"The water simply raised itself up and huge waves came ashore,\" wrote eye-witness Peter Thomas from India. \"It was moving very fast. The force broke the glass walls of a restaurant on the beach here and damaged hundreds of boats.\"\nIn some places, the _ struck with no warning. \"The weather was fine with no clouds,\" wrote an eye-witness in Indonesia. \"Suddenly the seawater just hit the city. In some parts the water was up to chest level.\"\nA massive effort to help the affected countries is already underway. Leaders from around the world have promised to help, and teams of aid workers and doctors are rushing to the sea. \"The United States stands ready to offer all the help to those nations most affected.\" Said White House spokesman Trent Duffy. Organizations from the Red Cross to the International Monetary Fund have started fund-raising drives to make up the costs of rebuilding.",
