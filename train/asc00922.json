  "article": "Although Thomas Edison created the technologies behind three major 21st century industries  electrical power,recorded music and movies--his greatest invention may have been the modern method of inventing.He basically came up with the modern system of research and development.Edison was not the only scientist doing research in his garage but someone who gathered around him a team of creative scientific minds.Edison's 1aboratories were the forerunners of Apple,Google and Microsoft.\nYet for a11 his scientific gifts,he was no Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.He once said,\"Anything that won' t sell,I don' t want to invent.\" But Edison,unlike Jobs or Gates,had no real sense of what the public wanted or how to change his discoveries into products that might sell.It took him years to understand that the phonograph was not a business tool but an entertainment invention.He helped create movies but resisted the idea that people might want to go into a theater to watch one.\nWe chose Edison this year because we need his example now more than ever.Though we live in a time of great reformation,the U.S.is in danger of losing its advantage in science and technology.American investment in research and development has not increased as a percentage of GDP since the mid1980s,while the government' s share has been dropping.And this is at a time when China is rapidly increasing its money on research and development.The U.S.was once among the 1eading nations.Now it ranks near the bottom of the 23 nations that collect such data.We hope that Edison' s story might not only encourage reformation but also inspire more\nyoung Americans to study science and engineering.",
