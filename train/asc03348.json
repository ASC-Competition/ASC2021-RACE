  "article": "If you are planning on traveling, there are few simple rules about how to make life easier both before and after your journey.\nFirst of all, always check and double-check departure   time. It is surprising how few people really do this carefully. Once I arrived at he airport a few minutes after ten. My secretary had got the ticket for me and I thought she had said that the plane left at 10:50. When I arrived at the airport, the person at the departure desk told me that my flight was closed. Therefore, I had to wait three hours for the next one and missed an important meeting.\nThe second rule is to remember that even in this age of credit cards  , it is still important to have some local money in cash  . Once I arrived at a place at midnight and the bank at the airport was closed. The only way to get to my hotel was by taxi but because I had no dollars, I offered to pay in pounds instead. \"Listen! I only take real money!\" the driver said angrily. You can imagine how terrible I felt at that moment.\nThe third and the last rule is to find out as much as you can about the weather at your destination  before you leave. I feel sorry for some of my workmates who travel in heavy suits and raincoats in May, when it is still fairly cool in London or Manchester, to places like Athens, Rome of Madrid, where it is already beginning to get quite warm during the day.",
