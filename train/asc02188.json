  "article": "Dear God,\nThis is Charles. I'm twelve. I'm typing this letter. Sometimes it's hard for me to write. It's a disease called dysgraphia. I also have learning disabilities, but my IQ was tested at 140.\nI could never hold a pencil in the right way. My brain doesn't sense what my hand is doing. I can feel the pencil, but the message doesn't get through right. I have to hold the pencil tighter so that my brain knows I have it in my hand.\nIt's much easier for me to explain things by talking than writing. There are so many things I can picture in my mind, but my hands just can't draw it the way I see it.\nIt's OK. I'm not complaining. I'm really doing fine. You see, you gave me a wonderful mind and a great sense of humor. I'm great at figuring things out, and I love to debate. We have some great discussions in class, and that's where I really shine.\nI want to be a lawyer when I grow up. I know I'd be good at it. You have told me that you made me special. You make me believe that you will see me through, and that you have plans for me to give me a future and hope. My parents want to help me, so they buy me a laptop. My teacher is the best this year! I am allowed to do a lot of my work on the computer.\nLife's hard sometimes, but I accept the challenge. Thanks for loving me. Thanks for everything.\nCharles",
