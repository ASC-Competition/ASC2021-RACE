  "article": "I have been in Limoges for a month now. since living here, I have tried to integrate  into the local community and one way I have found to do this is by following the local rugby team.\nI decided to look for information on the local rugby team after the tourism office could not help me. I searched for the club office online and decided to look into _ . The following day I went back to the club after speaking with them and decided to get a season ticket for the rest of my stay here. I will now be going to each home game as well as travelling to the away games with the team and the fans. I am sure that it is going to be a great experience during my time abroad here. I will also be travelling through various regions of France so I will be visiting new places throughout the season. There is another team in a town called Brive not so far away who play in the top league in France, but I decided to stay local. I may go and see them with other assistants if possible during our stay.\nI witnessed a friendly match on Saturday when they played Stade Dijon in the division below them. The match finished 70-12. After the match, both teams went to the club house to see the Rugby World Cup semi-final between New Zealand and Australia. Both teams respected each others which is something you don't always see in other sports. I spoke to the president of the club after the game and he told me, \"This is a family club.\" Hopefully this year will be a good year for Limoges.",
