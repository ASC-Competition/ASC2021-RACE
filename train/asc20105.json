  "article": "\"Everything happens for the best,\" my mother said whenever things weren't going my way. \"Don't worry, one day your luck will change.\" Mother was right, as I discovered after I had finished my college education. I had decided to try for a job in radio. One day, I wanted to host  a sports program. I went to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station. But I got turned down every time.\nIn one station, a kind lady said my problem was that I hadn't got enough experience. \" Get some work with a small station and work your way up,\" she said.\nI went back home. I couldn't get a job there, either. Then my dad told me a businessman had opened a store and needed someone to help him. But again, I didn't get the job.\nI felt really down. \" Your luck will change,\" Mom said to me. Dad lent me the car to help me to look for my job. I tried another radio station in Iowa. But the owner, a nice man, told me he had already had someone.\nAs I left his office, I asked, \"How can someone be a sports announcer  if he can't get a job in a radio station?\"\nI was waiting for the lift when I heard the man call. \" What did you mean? Do you know anything about football?\" He put me in front of a microphone and asked me to try to imagine that I was giving my opinion on a football game, I succeeded.\nOn my way home, Mom's words came back to me, \"One day your luck will change, Son. And when it happens, it'll feel doubly  good because of all the hard work you've had.\" At that moment I knew what just what she meant.",
