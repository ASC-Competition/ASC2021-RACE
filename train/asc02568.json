  "article": "My wife and I have always been friendly with the clerks at the local convenience store. I don't think many people appreciate what a difficult job these folks have. They work for a little over minimum wage and I often wonder how they make ends meet.\nOne of the clerks, Charlie, was always wearing his glasses but he didn't one day. I asked him about it and he said they'd been out of order and that he couldn't afford a new pair. His family needed money. It was obvious that he was having a difficult time.\nWe wanted to help him, so we turned to our own eye doctor for assistance with a plan. We had his secretary contact him, asking him to come in for an eye exam for free. We told the doctor to let him order whatever glasses he wanted and that we would pay for them. Although Charlie questioned what was going on, the doctor just told him that someone had offered the money for his new glasses. When we went in to pay the bill, the doctor told us he was so touched by our idea that he _ the exam fee and only charged us for half the price of the glasses!\nIt was so wonderful to see Charlie in her new glasses and he enjoyed telling all the regular customers how the gift came about. I'm sure that upon hearing her story, ideas of kindness may have emerged in the minds of many.",
