  "article": "It was a Saturday in May. When Mrs. Black opened the door and looked out, she smiled and said,\"It's going to be a beautiful day.\" She woke her little son up at eight thirty and said to him,\"Get up, Todd. We're going to the zoo today. Wash your hands and face, brush your teeth and have breakfast quickly. We are going to New York by train.\nTodd was six years old. He was very happy because he liked going to the zoo very much, and he also liked going by train. He said,\"I dreamed about the zoo last night, Mum.\"\nHis mother was in a hurry, but she stopped and smiled at her little son,\"What did you do in the zoo in your dream?\" Todd laughed and answered,\"You know. You were there in my dream, too.\"",
