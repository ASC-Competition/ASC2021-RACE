  "article": "They may be small, and unable to have an adult conversation, but babies are proving their collective cleverness.\nWhile your baby still might not be able to speak, he or she knows about you're feeling down. Babies as young as 5 months of age can distinguish an exciting tune from a sad one, according to a study published in 2014 in the journalNeuron.\nSpeaking of music, it seems that babies can't resist it. Not only are their ears sensitive to the beats, babies can actually dance in time to them, according to a study published in 2010. To test their dancing ability, the researchers played recordings of classical music and speech to them, and videotaped the results. The babies moved their arms, hands, legs, feet, and heads much more in response to the music than to speech. The findings suggest this dancing ability is innate  in humans.\nBabies can apparently learn even while asleep. As newborn babies spend most of their time sleeping, this newfound ability might be crucial  for them to adapt rapidly to the world around them, and help ensure survival, the researchers say. The study was published in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nDeciding whether another person is helpful or harmful is crucial in choosing friends -- and that ability starts being visible early. Kiley Hamlin of Yale University showed both 6- and 10-month-olds some anthropomorphized  shapes, in which one shape helped another climb a hill, while a third shaped pushed the climber down. The little ones then got to choose which shape they preferred. For both age groups, most babies chose the helper shapes. This character-judging ability could be the first step in the formation of morals, Hamlin says.",
