  "article": "Damini Bansal (14 years old)\nFreedom is something different in everybody's way of thinking--a student would probably like to raise a revolt  against all the obnoxious  rules of his or her school and as a grown up one might want to have less responsibilities .\nFreedom according to me is the power in me to make some of my life's decisions on my own. And this Independence Day   will be a lot more different than our first one in 1947 when people actually came to know what it was like to be free, for them it was the dawn of a new day, it was a day when they could do what they felt was right.\nWe have come far from all of this. We now no longer see the Independence Day as a day of very great importance for the students of my class (and most of the children of my age), and the most important value is that it is a holiday.\nArihant Jain (12 years old)\nWe can do anything we want like not going to school.\nEverything should be free. We should not pay money to buy anything.\nCan go anywhere I want...to the playground when exams are on.\nChatting on phone as long as I want.\nTo eat dinner outside everyday.\nIn school being able to play sports and not study.\nFlying Kites.",
