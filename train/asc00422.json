  "article": "Erica and Steve Lineberry have been rock climbing since 2005. They were first introduced to it while visiting a family in Montana. Now they are at climbing centers, like Inner Peaks in Charlotte, three times a week, and on weekends they climb outdoors.\nSteve said they first started climbing as part of their exercise. Years later, he lost 60 pounds. But as the couple's interest in the sport grew, they consulted some _ and started climbing outdoors.\nThen Erica got pregnant. \"Most people think that rock climbing and pregnancy don't go very well together,\" Erica said. But with lots of places to go, Erica kept climbing through her pregnancy. Then her son, Canaan, was born. She says the baby immediately started participating in the family sport. \"He went to the gym the first time with us at four weeks old, and then we took our first outdoor trip, just a day trip, at six weeks old with him.\"\nNow Canaan is three-year-old, and Erica is once again pregnant: 7 months along. During her first pregnancy, she blogged about climbing while pregnant. Now her Cragmama.com website is a top resource for families who rock climb. Erica said, \"I think a lot of people will say, they'll wait a few years until they get into an easier age or an easier life phase with their kids. And I think if they wait for that they're going to wait forever.\" Her message to women is to quickly climb back into the things you love; and that your life is not over once you are a mother.\nCragmama.com website is quickly becoming the face of mommy rock climbing. She contributes to a handful of climbing magazines. Outdoor equipment companies ask her to wear and use their gear . And her website is a popular resource for families who are not only interested in climbing with their children, but also interested in taking on other adventures too.",
