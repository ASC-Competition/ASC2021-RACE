  "article": "This is new for me and  I don't know what to say really, so I just want to have a try.I was always a runner and in pretty good shape for most of my life.Then unluckily, I couldn't get myself  out to run.\nI put on weight  and it made me feel worse about myself.I found it was much harder to begin to run again after a few years than it used to be and I tried my best through even the shortest, slowest jog.\nI was out in a run the other day and I had almost decided to give up before I heard someone say ,\"You can do it ! It's hard ,but you can do it !\"there was a lady walking the other way and had the biggest smile on her face.\nThose words encouraged me at a time when I was ready to give up.I finished my run and now every time I feel like giving up ,I can \"hear\"her encouragement.\nI've never seen her again ,so I've never been able to thank her and let her know that something so simple as a few words of encouragement from a stranger influenced (and still influence)me so much.",
