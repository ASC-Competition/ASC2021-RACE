  "article": "\"Can you take me golfing sometimes?\" my 13-year-old son asked.\nI had a bathroom to remodel . I wanted to say no. \"Sure,\" I said.\"What did you have in mind ?\"\n\"Well, maybe you could, like, pick up Jared and me after school on Friday and take us out to Oakway.\"\n\"Sounds good.\"\nFriday came. In front of the school, Ryan and Jared piled in. Ryan looked confused.\n\"What's with the golf hat, Dad ?\" he asked\nIt was, I thought, a silly question, like asking a diver: \"What's with the swim fins  ?\"\n\"Well, I thought we were going to play some golf.\"\nThere was a strange pause. \"Uh, you're going, too ?\" He asked. Suddenly, it struck me that I hadn't been invited. Thirteen years of parenting flashed before my eyes.\nAll these memories sped by in about two seconds, leaving me about three seconds to reply.\nI had to say something. I wanted to say this: \"How could you do this to me? We have always been a team.\" But I said: \"Me? Play? No. You know I'm up to my ears in the remodel project.\"\nWe drove on in silence for a few moments. \"So, how are you planning to play for this?\" I asked, my wounnded ego  reaching for the dagger \n\"Uh, could you loan me $7?\"\nOh, I get it. He doesn't want me, but he'll gladly take my money.\n\"No problem, \" I said.\nI dropped him and Jared off, wished them luck, and headed for home. Life would never be the same.\nI walked in the door. \"What are you doing home?\" my wife asked.\n\"I wasn't invited.\" I replied.\nAnother one of those strange pauses came. Then my wife laughed. Out loud. At first, I was hurt. Then I, too, laughed.\nI went back to the bathroom remodel and realized that this is what life is all about: change.\nA few hours later, I heard Ryan walk in the front door.\n\"Dad,\" he said, \"My game stinks . Can you take me golfing sometime ? I need some help.\"\nI wanted to hug him and shout: \"I'm still needed!\"\nInstead, I got one of those serious-dad looks on my face and said: \"Sure, Ry, anytime.\"",
