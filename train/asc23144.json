  "article": "Animals have the ability to make people understand them, especially  when they are in serious danger and hope to get help from man. And they often go together to help one another.\nOne day, I visited my friend Jack on a sheep farm in North America. Suddenly one sheep came to cry in front of us. She made the most painful  cries. Jack said ,\"Something must be wrong. Come on, Mike. Let's follow her.\"\nTogether we followed the sheep back to where she was feeding on the farm. She rushed forward and kept on looking back to see if we were coming. She finally took us to an old well   , and we heard the sad voice of her young baby that had fallen into the well. As the well had no water and was only six feet deep, we took a ladder  and climbed down. After a few minutes, the baby sheep was saved. The mother sheep looked happy with the successful   result of the _ . She came to tell us her trouble and got help. How amazing!",
