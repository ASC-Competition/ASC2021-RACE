  "article": "Le Val de Cantobre, Aveyron (France)\nIt's in the grounds of a medieval house. There's a swimming pool, a river and a pizza restaurant. The scenery   around the park is beautiful and great for walking. A week's stay will cost you about EUR280.\nFor more information please go to www.eurocamp.co.uk.\nFour Seasons Tented Camp, Golden Triangle (Thailand)\nThis must be one of the best campsites ( ) in the world. Instead of tents, there are \"canvas cabins  \". And there's a gourmet restaurant, a spa and a pool. There are only 15 of cabins to rent so you'll have to book early. The campsite can only be reached by river boat, but once there you can learn to ride an elephant. Unfortunately, it isn't cheap, and two nights at the Four Seasons will cost you about EUR1,500!\nFor more information please go to www.Fourseasons.com/goldentriangle.\nThree Cliffs Bay, Gower (Wales)\nThe Three Cliffs Bay is in a beautiful part of the country, and it won't cost you much either: a family tent (2 adults, 2 children) is about EUR28 a day. There's a camp shop where you can buy food and drinks, and there are pubs and restaurants nearby so you won't even have to cook. You can water-ski from the beach, or go walking along the Gower Way.\nFor more information please go to www.Threecliffsbay.com.\nLongitude 131, Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park (Australia)\nSituated in the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, near the massive   red rock formerly known as Ayer's Rock, this is more like a hotel than a campsite. There's a restaurant, a pool and even a library. The only problem is that it's a bit expensive -- around EUR1,500 a night.\nFor more information please go to www.Longitude131.com.au.",
