  "article": "Grace and I are good friends. We get on very well with each other, though sometimes we fight. I remember last year we didn't talk with each other for a long time before Mid-Autumn Day. But when we met each other that day, we became good friends again.\nWe both study well. We like talking about the problems in our studies.We also like making up  stories.We made one up in English last month. It was called \"Magic Sunflower Club\".  I think this is a wonderful name.\nGrace is tall and active. She does better in  P.E. than me.  She is good at music. She plays the piano so well that sometimes birds come to listen to her.\nI'm shorter and quieter than Grace. I know a lot about science. I often have some new ideas. I'm good at math and art. Our teacher says my drawing is getting better and better. If we don't know something very well, we help each other. So we never have any problems.",
