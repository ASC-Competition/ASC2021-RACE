  "article": "Everyone experiences stress at work, but how we cope with it varies. Feeling that you've been unfairly treated can be particularly stressful. Researchers believe that failure to express feelings about unfair treatment at work could have serious consequences on your health, especially men, who bottle up their anger at being unfairly treated at work, are up to 5 times more likely to suffer a heart attack, or even die from one, than those who let their frustration   show, a Swedish study has found.\nThe study by the Stress Research Institute of Stockholm University followed 2,755 employed men who had not suffered any heart attacks. At the end of the study, 47 participants had either suffered an attack, or died from heart disease, and many of those had been found to be covertly coping with unfair treatment at work.\n\"After adjustment for age, socioeconomic factors, risk behaviors, job strain and biological risk factors at baseline, there was a close-response relationship between covert coping and the risk of incident death,\" the study's authors wrote.\nCovert coping was listed as \"letting thing pass without saying anything\" and \"going away\" despite feelings of being hard done by colleagues or bosses. Men who often used these coping techniques had a two to five times higher risk of developing heart disease than those who were more confrontational   at work, the study showed.\nThe researchers said they could not answer the question of what might be a particularly healthy coping strategy at work, but listed open coping behavior when experiencing unfair treatment or facing a conflict as \"protesting directly,\" \"talking to the person right away,\" \"yelling at the person right away\" or \"speaking to the person later when things have calmed down.\" The study was published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.",
