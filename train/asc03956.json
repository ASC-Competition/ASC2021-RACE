  "article": "A Chinese actor's divorce from his wife has social media buzzing, with posts about the subject gaining over five billion views. WangBaoqiang announced online on Sunday that he was divorcing his wife, Ma Rong. He alleged that his marriage broke down after his wife had an affair with his agent, and that she had also transferred the couple's joint assets. The topic has sparked a debate about relationships and divorce, and it seems Wang's predicament  has struck a chord with  many -- which could explain the number of views, which are high even by Chinese standards.\nWhat exactly are they saying?\nChinese netizens seem to have rallied around Wang, with topics like #WangDon'tCry# #WangWeSupportYou#, quickly trending after news of the divorce spread. Statistics by Weibo showed that 87% of netizens' posts condemned Ma for her affair, saying it had shattered her family. Some have even published her home address online. \"Wang is a hardworking man from a rural area. She cheated an honest man. I hate these kinds of people,\"said one commenter on weibo.\nBut why are they so interested?\nNo other celebrity divorce or marriage has ever caused such a big stir on Chinese social media. On the surface, this might seem like just another Chinese celebrity split. But what is it about this one that's got all of China ruffled up? Some people feel that this divorce seems to fit a certain trope -- of a beautiful but ordinary girl marrying a rich but less good-looking man. It is not uncommon to hear the belief that a couple has to \"match\" at every level -- be it in status, or physical appearance -- for a relationship to work out. \"The concept of being evenly matched is still one that is widely believed in China,\" Dr Mu Zheng, Assistant Professor, Department of Sociology at the National University of Singapore told the BBC's Yvette Tan.\nIt's also making people talk about divorce.\nA lot of social media discussion has also centred around divorce, and in particular how people can protect themselves. Wang has alleged that his wife transferred and hid some of the couple's assets. They're a wealthy couple -- their assets, according to Chinese media, include nine flats, a BMW car and various luxury goods. As a result, people are debating the importance of protecting individual assets, even after marriage. Attitudes towards divorce are fast changing in China, and divorce rates are on the rise. State newspaperGlobal Timessays a total of 3.84 million couples in China divorced in 2015, an increase of 5.6% from 2014.\"People are getting much more open to the idea of divorce now, especially as Chinese people become more educated and open-minded towards both marriage and divorce,\" says Dr Mu.",
