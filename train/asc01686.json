  "article": "parents usually go to malls to find new school supplies for their children. One of the most important things to get during this time is the  backpack. Most students choose to bring a backpack because it allows them to have both hands free. This makes the bag less likely to hinder  other activities that the person carrying it may be doing at the same time. Here are the ways parents can choose the perfect backpack for school.\nHow many books will children be carrying to school? How many notebooks should be inside the bag? Parents should know these details before buying a bag for their children. Each situation requires a different bag so it pays to ask children about the expected load.\nDo children need special storage for the bag? If they will be carrying a laptop computer inside the new backpack,make sure that parents get a model that's designed specifically for laptop use. This will protect the computer from bumps and falls that might damage the device if it had less protection.\nAre children going to use the bag for a long time? If they want to use a bag for a long time,parents will be better off investing in a good brand that is known for quality. Parents may have to pay extra cash to get the top of the line and the best backpack in the market.[:##     Count the pockets. Backpacks usually come with a lot of pockets,and generally,the more pockets,the better. This allows children to organize their things,like pens and pencils inside small pockets.\nPicking the perfect school backpack is all about getting  the sweet compromise  between form,function and price. Remember to choose the best fit for children's needs.[:]",
