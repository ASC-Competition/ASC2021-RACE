  "article": "Jess really felt very happy.When he arrived at his seat in the classroom that morning,he found an invitation on his desk.It was from several of his classmates asking him to join them on a camping trip.This was the first time he was asked to join in an out-of-school activity.Why were they asking him now? Nobody seemed to like him.In fact,he had been so lonely that he drowned his feeling with food.As a result,he had put on a lot of weight,and this gave the kids something more to make fun of him.\nCindy,who was standing near Jess when he read the invitation,went out quickly to tell the others that the trick had worked.Everyone was pleased that Jess thought that was true.But there was no camping trip.The whole thing was made up.\nAt first,Cindy thought it was fun.But later,when Jess told her that he was going to buy a sleeping bag with his savings ,Cindy had a second idea.She knew that Jess's family had little money,and she hated to see him spend his savings on something he would never use.Cindy also hated to tell Jess the truth.Her close friends would be angry with her.What could she do now?",
