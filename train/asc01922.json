  "article": "With more and more cars on the road, traffic jams  are really a problem. Traffic jams can lead to increased accidents as there are more cars, with more people trying to get to their destination, all the while getting worse. Although it's impossible to avoid traffic jams altogether, there are some tips you can follow to reduce the amount of time on the road.\nCheck for traffic jams before you leave. You can listen to the radio for traffic news, or check on the Internet to get up-to-minute information on traffic. If the way you want to take is heavy with traffic, you can choose another.\nLook for a different road all the time. Most traffic jams happen on busy roads. Using country roads could see you avoiding a lot of traffic. Although the distance you may have to travel is further, it can work out quicker.\nSet your car radio to receive traffic news. Many new car stereo systems   are equipped with a radio system by which you can hear the traffic channel. This way you can get the latest traffic information and change your journey if necessary.\nTry traveling at different time. Most traffic jams usually happen during rush hour, so try to avoid this time period if possible. Some jobs offer flexible  working hours so that you can travel to work outside of rush hour. Some jobs even allow you to work at home so as to avoid moving altogether. Ask your manager to see what you can do if traffic is a problem for you.\nUse public transportation where available. The easiest way to avoid traffic jams is to take buses or the underground instead of driving your own car. Not only will you avoid traffic jams but you will most likely be saving money as the cost rises.",
