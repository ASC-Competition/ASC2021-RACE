  "article": "A study made by University of Sussex found that men and women who frequently used several types of technology at the same time had less grey matter in a key part of the brain . The researchers said : \" Simultaneously , using mobile phones , laptops and other media devices could change the structure of our brains . \" Worryingly , the part of the brain that shrinks is involved in processing emotion . The finding has linked multi-tasking with a shortened attention span , depression , anxiety and lower grades at school .\nThe researchers began by asking 75 healthy men and women how often they divided their attention between different types of technology . This could mean sending a text message while listening to music and checking email , or speaking on the phone while watching TV and surfing the web . The volunteers were then given brain scans which showed they had less grey matter in a region called the anterior cingulated cortex ( ACC ) . The findings held even when differences in personality were taken into account . The study , published in the journal PLOS ONE , is the first to make a link between multi-tasking and the structure of the brain .\nResearcher KepKeeLoh said : \" Media multi-tasking is become more popular in our lives today and there is growing concern about its impacts on our cognition and social-emotional well-being . \" He added that more researches are needed to prove that multi-tasking shrinks the brain . This is because it is also possible that people with less grey matter in the ACC are more likely to use lots of devices simultaneously .\nScientists have previously described brain structure can be altered on prolonged exposure to new environments and experience . Other studies have shown that training - such as learning magic or taxi drivers learning the map of London - can increase grey matter densities in certain parts .",
