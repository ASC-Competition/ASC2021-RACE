  "article": "Even at school there had been an unhealthy competition between George and Richard.\n\"I'll be the first millionaire in Coleford!\" Richard used to boast.\n\"And you'll be sorry that you knew me,\" George would reply \"because I'll surely be the best lawyer in our town!\"\nAfter graduation, George never became a lawyer and Richard was anybody but a millionaire .... Instead, it happened that both men opened bookshops on opposite sides of Coleford High Street, while it was hard to make much money from books then, which made the competition between them worse. Eventually, Richard closed down his, dreaming of making a fortune elsewhere.\nNow, with only one bookshop in the town, business was better for George.

The company, owned by multi-millionaire Richard Pike, is now the largest bookseller in this country.\"",
