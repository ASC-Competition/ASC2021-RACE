  "article": "Disneyland calls itself the happiest place in the world. In order to keep visitors happy in its locations across the globe, every theme park in the world is changed slightly to satisfy local cultures and tastes.\nOpened in 1983 and larger than the original California Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland is the third most visited of any theme park in the world after the two Disney parks in the US. Like Walt Disney World in Florida, Cinderella's Castle is located at the centre of the park.\nBut like karaoke, which originated in Japan and is a country-wide obsession  , Disneyland gives the often-reserved   Japanese people a place to show their noisy side. In Tokyo Disneyland, even adult visitors will sing, clap and dance along to the internationally themed live shows, which is a rare sight in the US.\nAfter excitedly entering Disneyland Paris, which opened in 1992, visitors can see an arcade  that features a small copy of the Statue of Liberty - a gift from France to American in 1886, making it a perfect introduction to this Europe's only Disneyland theme park.\nUnfortunately, the French stereotype of a smoking wine drinker is supported in Disneyland Paris. Many visitors complain   that although the theme park is equipped with special smoking areas, most smokers seem to puff away   in all the open areas, including in queues for rides. _",
