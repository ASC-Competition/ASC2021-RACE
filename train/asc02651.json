  "article": "You may have experienced the frustration of being slapped with a parking fine or finding your car held firmly in the place after leaving it parked precariously  for a couple of minutes. But now a high-tech car sticker that's designed to be stuck to a car's windscreen, could help motorists avoid such a situation by allowing a traffic warden to get in touch with them.\nThe TowStop sticker sends a text message to a driver when it is touched by a traffic warden, to allow motorists to send a reply and give them time to move their car immediately. It's designed to save drivers time and money by giving them a chance to move their car instead of having it towed  away but relies on the good will of traffic wardens. Frankfurt-based IT consultant , Daniel Kalliontzis, came up with the idea and is raising funds on Indiegogo to put his EUR54 (PS43) sticker into production.\nCar owners can buy the sticker and place it inside their car's windscreen, having set it up with important information, such as their phone number. The message will ask them to move their car immediately .The driver could then type a reply for the warden using their smartphone, which will appear on the sticker's screen. They may choose to write something along the lines of back in two minutes in a bid to avoid a fine.\nThe smart sticker system will rely on the good will of traffic wardens and critically, a German law. The law states: An officer has to choose the most efficient and inexpensive way for the car owner to remove the vehicle. It could be cheaper for the authorities to contact the driver than to tow his car.",
