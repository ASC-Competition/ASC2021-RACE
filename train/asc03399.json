  "article": "It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind.\nThe game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over.\nAfter suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much.\nInjuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life.\nCurrently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well.",
