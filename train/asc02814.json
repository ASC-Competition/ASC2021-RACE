  "article": "Winnie-the-Pooh\nBy A. A. Milne\nWinnie-the-Pooh has been introduced and reintroduced to generation after generation as a model of a child's best friend. However, not everyone has found Pooh is lovely. This classic has been banned in a variety of countries at one point. So why would anyone ever want to keep children from the joy of Milne's classic? In the case of Russia, Winnie-the-Pooh was banned in 2009 because of alleged Nazi   ties.\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\nBy Frank Baum\nOriginally published in the year 1900, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is one of the foundations of the fairytale genre. Who, then, would seek to ban a book that has become so important to the American experience?\nAmerica is that who. The Detroit Library banned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1957 for having no value for children.\nCharlotte's Web\nBy E. B. White\nWhite's tale of the relationship between two unexpected creatures, a spider and a pig, has been drawing children in for over half a century. Published in 1952, this classic has been readily available on most library shelves for children to read. However, some people would like to make this book never see the light of day.\nIn one extreme case, a school in England banned Charlotte's Web for fear that the pig Wilbur might be offensive   to Muslim students. Fortunately, the Muslim Council of Britain saw the foolishness of this ban, so the book was quickly restored to its right place on the shelves.\nWhere the Wild Things Are\nBy Maurice Sendak\nThough its first copy was published fifty years ago, this book hasn't always been readily available in libraries and in stores. After its release, Where the Wild Things Are was banned in libraries all across the U.S. for its dark tone and unruly leading characters. Nowadays, you'll find far fewer libraries that still hold this ban.",
