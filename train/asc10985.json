She said no new ones would be permitted until experts had reviewed safety standards.\n     Germany will put off \"the recently decided extension of the running time of Cerman nuclear  plants,\" Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. \"This moratorium   will run for three months and it will allow for a thorough exanunation of the safety standards of the country's 17 nuclear power plants.\n     The European Union called for a meeting on Tuesday of nuclear safety authorities to assess Europe's preparedness.\n     Germany's foreign minister, Cuido Westerwelle, called for a new risk analysis of the counitry' snuclear plants, particularly regarding their cooling systems. He is the leader of the Free Democratic Party, which strongly supports nuclear power.\n     A previous government,led by the Social Democrats, passed a law in 2001 to close all the country's nuclear plants by 2021. But Mrs. Merkel' s government changed that decision last year to extend the lives of the plants by an average of 12 years.\n In Switzerland, Doris Leuthard said she had already asked to analyze the exact cause of the  problems in Japan and draw up new or tougher safety standards \"particularly in terms of seismic( )safety and cooling.\"\nIn Russia, the Prime Minister said his govemment would \"draw conclusions from what's going\non in Japan.\"",
