After breakfast, I take the subway to get to school.\nThis term, I have a new subject . It's physics. I like it best. I think it is very easy and interesting. I have physics classes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. They are all my favorite days.\nMr.White is my physics teacher. He is now forty years old . Now he is in front of the blackboard. What's he doing now ? \"Where is my physics book ? I am looking for it .\" My deskmate , Mike , stands up and says , \"Sir , it's in your hand .\" We all laugh . Mr. White is very forgetful .\n,.",
