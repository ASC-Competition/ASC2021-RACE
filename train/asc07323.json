  "article": "My husband had just bought a new washing machine for me. I decided to use it the other day and I washed a lot of things.\nEverything worked well, but I found one of my husband's socks missing. I looked everywhere for it, but I couldn't find it anywhere. The next morning, I got ready for school as usual. When the bell rang, the students came in, I greeted them and told them what we were going to do that day.\nWhen I turned around to write on the blackboard, the class burst out laughing.\nThey laughed and laughed. They laughed so much, in fact, that I was afraid the headmaster would be in and see all this. I asked the class to stop, but the more I talked, the more they laughed. I decided to pay no attention to them and continued to write on the blackboard. When I did this, they laughed even more. Finally, the teacher who was in the next room came in to see what all the laughter was about. When he came in, he started laughing, too!\n\"Good heavens,\" I said. \"Will someone please tell me what is so funny?\"\n\"Oh, God,\" said the teacher. \"You have a brown sock stuck to the back of your skirt!\"\nSo that's how I found my husband's missing sock. \"Oh, well,\" I said to the class,\" Let's just say you have had an unforgettable lesson on static electricity .\"",
