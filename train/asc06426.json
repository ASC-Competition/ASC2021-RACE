  "article": "Mark Twain, the famous American writer, was once traveling in France .He went by train to Dijon. He was very tired and wanted to sleep. He therefore asked the conductor to wake him up when the train came to Dijon\nBut first he explained he was a very heavy sleeper,\"I may bossibly protest loudly when you try to wake me up,\"he said to the conductor. \"But don't take any notice of what I say. Just put me off the train anyway.\"\nThen Mark Twain went to sleep. Later, when he woke up it was night time and the train had reached Paris already. He realized at once that the conductor had forgotten to wake him up at Dijon. He was so angry that he ran to the conductor and began to shout at him.\n\"I have never been so angry in my life,\"Mark Twain said.\nThe conductor looked at him calmly .\"You are not half so angry as the American whom I put off the train at Dijon,\"he said.",
