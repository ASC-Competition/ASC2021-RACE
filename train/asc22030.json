  "article": "The day was like any other day in his life, Tom walked past the shop on the street corner. He stopped to look at the front row of shoes, and he felt happy to see that the pair of shoes he wanted very much was still there. Looking down, he felt sorry for himself. He really wanted to have them for his birthday.\nHe sadly walked away and thought how to tell his mother about it. He knew she would give him anything he liked if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home at once, as he looked worried and his mother would notice  it. So he went to the park and sat on the grass. Then he saw a boy in a wheel chair   . He noticed that the boy moved the wheel with his hands. Tom looked at him carefully and was surprised to see the boy have no feet. He looked at his own feet. \"It's much better to be without shoes than without feet, \"he thought. There was no reason   for him to feel so sorry and sad. He went away and smiled, thinking he was happier",
