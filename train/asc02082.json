  "article": "Nick Santonastasso has one arm equipped with one finger. He has no legs. He also has no limitations .\n\" I know anything's possible ,\" the 12-year-old told TODAY 's Ann Curry.\nHe can play baseball and football, play the keyboard and drums, and play video games with his brothers.\nWhen Nick was born, he suffered a disease only found in 11 other people. The Santonastassos had three other children, and they decided to treat Nick the same as others, with love but without excuse\n\" We're supposed to be heroes to our children, but Nick is a hero to us,\" his father Michael said. But heroes have heroes, too, and Nick's is Tiki Barber, the former football superstar who retired last year and became a reporter for TODAY. Curry told Nick that for his birthday, the show wanted to give him a new skateboard. The person who presented it to him was Barber.\n\" You're an inspiration,\" Barber said. \" There are a lot of kids who might be at a disadvantage.\nYou give them strength.\"\nCurry observed that most parents try to protect their kids from failure, but the Santonastassos didn't do that with Nick.\n\"Absolutely not, \"Nick's mother Stacey said. \" If you do have a small failure, it just makes you stronger to succeed at the next stop.\"\n\" It builds self-confidence in yourself to try it again,\" Nick added.\nRecently, Nick entered a drawing in a statewide contest in New Jersey. His drawing was a tree with a spreading canopy   and deep toots. Above the tree were the words, \"The roots of a family are...\" Below the ground, the roots spelled out the final word for the message: \" Love.\"\nIt won the contest. The judges didn't know Nick' physical condition. He won on merit  , the same way he does everything else in life.",
