  "article": "What Should I Do?\nOne of the most popular items in the school newspaper advice column . No one know who writes it. The students think their teacher does, but it might be a student using a false name. The students enjoy thinking up problems for the advice column. Here are some of them and their answers.\nASK THE WISE OWL\nQ: I'm always late for school. I try not to be, but I can't help it. Please advise me what to do.   Tommy.\nA: You are probably late for school because you don't really like school. My advice to you is try and enjoy school more, then you won't be late so often.\nQ: I find it difficult to make friends. What do you think I should do?  Sara.\nA: I can't advise you until I know about you. Your problem may be that you are shy. On the other hand, it may be the opposite. You may be too bold . Write and tell me more about yourself.\nQ: I'm always at the bottom of the class. What do you advise me to do? Molly.\nA: I advise you to concentrate  on improving your grades in one subject to start with. If you can do this, you should move a little way up from the bottom. Next, try to improve your grades in another subject, and so on. If you concentrate on one subject at a time, by the end of the year you should be quite a long way up from the bottom in all your classes. The Wise Owl.",
