  "article": "When many of us take a vacation, more than anything, we seek to relax. We spend long, lazy days on a beach chair or in a hammock  . But too often, we return home, very very tired.\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Come home _ after an active trip! And you won't be too tired!\nActive vacations are often the most relaxing ones of all. We don't expect you to take up jogging or backpacking. Rather, we ask the sedentary   vacationers to spend two to four hours a day doing things, such as walking in city streets, going to a zoo or biking beside the ocean.\nThese kinds of activities aren't just good for your physical health. They improve your mental health and even your spiritual health. And they make vacations memorable and worthwhile.\nHere are some fresh ideas to make your vacations as pleasurable as they are active and healthy.\n*A walk at dawn or dusk can make you feel or look young again. Try to make this a daily thing that is done regularly.\n*Don't allow yourself to spend all your time sitting in front of the water.\n*Many of us spend a large part of our vacations on the road, either getting to and from our destinations, or using the car for sightseeing. But no matter how beautiful the scenery is, great memorable vacations don't happen in a car seat.",
