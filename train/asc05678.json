  "article": "Britain is a popular tourist place. But tours of the country have pros and cons.\nGood news\nFree museums. No charge for outstanding collections of art and antiquities. \nPop music. Britain is the only country to match the US on this score.\nBlack cabs. London taxi drivers know where they are going even if there are never enough of them at weekends or night.\nChoice of food. Visitors can find everything from Ethiopian to Swedish restaurants.\nBad news\nPoor service. \"It's part of the image of the place. People can dine out on the rudeness they have experienced,\" says Professor Tony Seaton, of London University's International Tourism Research Center.\nPoor public transport: Trains and buses are promised to defeat the keenest \ntourists, although the over-crowded London tube is inexplicably  popular\nLack of languages. Speaking slowly and clearly may not get many foreign visitors very far, even in the tourist traps .\nRain. Still in the number one complaint .\nNo air-conditioning. So that even splendidly hot summers become as unbearable as the downpours.\nOverpriced hotels. The only European country with a higher rate of tax on hotel rooms is Denmark.",
