  "article": "Mark Twain was a great writer. He was from the USA. He was born in 1835. He was also a famous speaker. He was famous for his sense of humour. Many people liked to listen to him talk because he liked to tell some interesting stories to make people laugh all the time.\nOne day Mark Twain was going to a small town because of his writing. Before he was going to leave, one of his friends said to him that there were always a lot of mosquitoes  in the town and told him that he'd better not go there. Mark Twain waved   his hand and said, \"It doesn't matter. The mosquitoes are no relatives of mine. I don't think they will come to visit me.\"\nAfter he arrived at the town, Mark Twain stayed in a small hotel near the station. He went into his room, but when he was just about to have a rest, quite a few mosquitoes flew about him. The waiters felt very sorry about that. \"I'm very sorry, Mr. Mark Twain. There are too many mosquitoes in our town.\" One of them said to him.\nMark Twain, however, made a joke, saying to the waiter, \"The mosquitoes are very clever. They know my room number. They didn't come into the wrong room.\" What he said made all the people present laugh heartily.\nBut that night Mark Twain slept well. Do you know why? That was because all the waiters in the hotel were driving the mosquitoes away for him during the whole night.",
