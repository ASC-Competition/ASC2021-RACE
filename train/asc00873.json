  "article": "You are a new manager at the American branch of your German firm in Chicago.With a few minutes to spare between meetings,you go to get a quick cup of coffee.\n\"Hey,David,how are you?\"one of the senior partners at the firm asks you.\n\"Good,thank you,Dr.Greer,\"you reply.You've really been wanting to make a connection with the senior leadership at the firm,and this seems like a great opportunity.But as you start to think of something to say,your American colleague breaks in to steal your spotlight.\n\"So Arnold\",your colleague says to your boss,in such a casual manner that it makes your German soul cringe ,\"So what's your Super bowl prediction? I mean,you're a Niners fan,right?\"\nThe conversation moves on,and you walk silently back to your desk with your coffee.You know how important small talk is in the U.S.,and you feel jealous of people you're your colleague who can do it well.\nThere's nothing small about the role that small talk plays in American professional culture.People from other countries are often surprised at how important small talk is in the U.S.and how naturally and comfortably people seem to do it--with peers,men,women,and even with superiors.You can be the most technically skilled worker in the world,but your ability to progress in your job in the United States is highly dependent on your ability to build and maintain positive relationships with people at work.And guess what skill is critical for building and maintaining these relationships? Small talk.\nWhat can you do if you are from another culture and want to learn to use small talk in the U.S.to build relationships and establish trust? Work hard to hone your own version of American-style small talk.Watch how others do it.You don't have to mimic what they do;in fact,that would likely _ because people would see you as inauthentic.But if you can develop your own personal version,that can go a long way toward making you feel comfortable and competence.",
