On green leaves, it stays green. On a brown branch ,it turns brown. Some tree frogs can change from green to gold  or blue.\nTree frogs have legs and wide feet. They have sticky pads  at the end of their toes. These sticky toe pads keep the tree frogs from falling off the trees. Tree frogs have different colors and markings  on their skins.
