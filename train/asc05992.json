  "article": "One night last February, a seventeen-year-old Duffy drove home along a winding road, he saw a strange light thrown against the tree. \"I knew it wasn't the moon\", he said. \"I drive this road all the time and I notice little things out of place.\"\nDuffy stopped his car and got out to examine. Below him far down in the deep valley lay a broken car with its headlights on. Thirty minutes earlier, a man had driven off the edge of the road, which has no guardrail. His car fell and rolled end over end, landing on its top more than two hundred feet below.\nDuffy rushed to call for help, then returned and got down to reach the injured driver. Snow covered the valley and the temperature was below freezing. After struggling back up the cliff, Duffy took off his jacket and shirt and wrapped the injured man in time, along with the blankets from his car.\nLife-saving deeds are starting to become usual action for Duffy, the oldest of seven children. When he was 12, he saved his ten-year-old brother from drowning. Two years ago, his three-year-old sister ate rat poison, and Duffy cleaned out her mouth, make her drink milk to protect her stomach and called doctors.\n\"We have tried to teach the children good values, and it looks like we have got some reward for it.\" His father says.",
