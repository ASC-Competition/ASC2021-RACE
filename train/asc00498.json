  "article": "Last Friday my brother and I were driving home together after doing some shopping and gave our attention to an interesting conversation. Because of this distraction  my brother took a wrong turn.\nUnfortunately, the wrong turn took us towards a bridge and we had no way to turn back. Unwillingly, my brother paid the bridge fee and drove on. He was clearly frustrated by the mistake and the needless waste of $4.\nWe eventually reached an exit and, as we took it, my brother noticed a young fellow pulled over to the side of the road. He came out of his car and tried to phone someone. I was busy trying to figure out which way we would go next but my brother pulled over and asked the guy if he needed any help. And he did. He had a flat tire and needed a tool to get it off.\nMy brother gave him a wrench, and then began to help him change the flat. The young man said that this had been a bad week for him: earlier he had gotten into a minor car accident, and now this flat on his way home from work. But he called us \"a breath of fresh air\" and kept thanking us because he really would have been stuck if we hadn't come along.\nAfter we finished the job he thanked us again and pulled out $20 from his pocket and tried to give it to us. \"No,\" I said. \"We were never supposed to even get on that bridge,we took a wrong turn. But now we know why we did. It was to help you. Thank you for turning our mistake into an opportunity to serve.\"\nWhat I loved most was that my brother was able to see a chance to help. His reaction in the situation is a lesson for everyone and we felt so good the rest of the day.",
