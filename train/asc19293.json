  "article": "When I was 14, I decided to make some pocket money by mowing lawns   in summer. I worked hard because that was my first part-time job. After working for one week, Mr Miller said that he had no money for me. Oh, dear! He wouldn't pay for my work! That surprised me greatly. I argued with him, and then I went back home.\nMy parents told me not to complain about Mr Miller. He was in difficulties. Then my mother call up Mr Miller and they talked about something on the phone. A few days later, my mother asked me to return to Mr Miller's garden, because he was too weak to look after it.\nWhen I came back, Mr Miller said, \"Sorry, I have no money, but I can do something for you.\" He played CD for me. Hearing the beautiful music, I was so interested in it that I forgot the money and did the work with pleasure. At last, Mr Miller gave me a ticket to a concert.\nAfter that, I became very interested in music. And now, I have been a popular musician. I should thank Mr Miller greatly.",
