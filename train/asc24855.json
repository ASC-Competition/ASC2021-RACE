  "article": "The car was invented   just a century ago. You may know all kinds of cars' names, but many people don't know who was the inventor of the first car. The first car was invented not by a German, but by an American. His name was Henry Ford. Henry was born in a poor family. He was the eldest of six children. When he was a boy, he became interested in mending watches and machines. When he was twelve years old, his mother died. Soon he had to work in a machine shop for two dollars and fifty cents a week. In the evenings he repaired watches for another dollar a week. The hard life made him strong and able.\nAt that time there was another interest in the life of the young ford. He dreamed  to make a machine. It could run without a horse, so named \"horseless carriage.\" He over-came  a lot of difficulties and in April 1893, the \"horseless carriage\" was finally finished. It was the first car.\nLater Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company . He was really the first inventor of the car in the world.",
