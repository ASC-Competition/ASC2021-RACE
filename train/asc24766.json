  "article": "Can plants eat people? Probably not,but there are many plants that eat meat.Some of them are big.And they can eat small animals.One famous meat-eating plant is the Venus flytrap .\nThe Venus flytrap is a very strange plant.It grows in dry parts of the United States.Its leaves are like the pages of a book.They can open and close very quickly.Inside the leaves,there are three small hairs.If a fly touches one of the hairs,the leaf closes quickly.The fly cannot get out.In about half an hour,the leaf _ the fly until it is dead.Then,the plant covers the fly.Slowly,the plant eats the fly.\nWhy do plants do it? Most plants get what they need from the sun,the air,and the ground.In some places,the ground is very poor.It doesn't have all these important things,\nespecially nitrogen .Animal meat has a lot of nitrogen, so some plants eat meat to get what they need.Let's hope that some of the bigger plants don't get the same idea !",
