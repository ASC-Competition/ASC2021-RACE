  "article": "Babies love chocolate and sometimes they also eat the paper around it. My cat enjoys a meal of goods, thick paper and letters, for example. She doesn't like newspapers very much.\nOf course, the best paper comes from wood. Wood comes from trees, and trees are plants. Vegetables and fruit are plants too, and we eat a lot of them. So can we also eat wood and paper? \nScientists say, \"All food comes in some way from plants.\" Well, is that true? Animals eat grass and grow fat. Then we eat their meat. Little fish eat little sea plants; then bigger fish swim along and eat them. Chickens eat bits of grass and give us meat. Think for a minute. What food does not come from plants in some way?\nScientists can do wonderful things with plants. They can make food just like meat and cheese. And they can make it without the help of animals. Now they have begun to say, \"We make our paper from wood. We can also make food from wood. The next thing is not very difficult.\" What is the next thing? Perhaps it is food from paper. Scientists say, \"We can turn paper into food. It will be good, cheap food too; cheaper than meat or fish or eggs.\"\nSo please keep your old books and letters. Don't feed them to your cat. One day, soon they will be on your plate.  _ .",
