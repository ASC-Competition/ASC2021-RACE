  "article": "Hello, everyone! I am Zhang Xin. Do you know what I see in America? Well, it is really an interesting trip. Now, 1et me tell you what I find in this trip.\nIn China, I have five English classes every week. When I study English,my teacher teaches me to say \"I am fine\" when people ask me \"How are you?\" But in the US., I find people say \"I am good,\" or \"I' m not so good.\"\nOne day, someone says to me with \"What's up?\" But I don't know what to say.\nAll the girls want to be nice. US girls like to get at a _ in the sun. But in China, girls only want to get white.\nIn China, study comes first, so we study hard and that's it. But in the US, a \"good\" student also does much for others , and they play sports or music after school.\nAfter I come back from the US, I think for a long time. I can't forget this trip!",
