  "article": "Americans think much about time. From childhood they learn to value time. They are taught to be on time to go to school, to work and to do everything. When they are having a good time, they say that time goes easily. When a person is dying, they say he is living on a borrowed time.\nTime is money. Time is knowledge. Time is everything in America. A working American has to work hard for eight hours a day or forty hours a week. This is the working time. In his free time, he also works hard for more money. Even on Saturday and Sunday he also works hard as usual. In the street you can hardly see a man walking slowly. They walk very fast. In fact, they are running.\nThey love time because time can bring them money and lots of things. But sometimes they also hate time , because they feel they have become servants of the clock .",
