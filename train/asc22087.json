Her husband looked at her and said, \"Is this what I come home to see after a hard day's work?\"\nMr Jones' neighbour, Mrs Smith, was there. When she heard Mr Jones' words, she quickly said goodbye and ran back to her house. Then she washed and combed   her hair carefully, put on her best dress and her most beautiful stockings, painted her face, and waited for her husband to come home.\nWhen he arrived, he was tired. He walked slowly into the house, saw his wife and stopped. Then he shouted angrily, \" And where are you going this evening ?\"",
