More and more people have realized we should do something to help them.\nOne of the biggest problems is that the children are all hungry for the love from their parents. Many of them can just get a call or a letter from their parents half a year, a year or even several years, which makes _ When they meet their own troubles, they have no one to talk with. Nobody gives them enough care.\nBecause of being too far away from their parents, the left-behind children's study is the second biggest problem.
