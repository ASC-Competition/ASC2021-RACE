  "article": "To switch or not to switch, that is the question.Google's announcement of its Nexus One smartphone  happened over a week ago and I'm still receiving lots of e-mails from readers asking the same question: Should they give up their iPhone for the Nexus One?\nSome people with iPhones, disappointed by American Telephone&Telegraph's inadequate service and the high monthly cost, are wondering if they have really got something to replace it.Does the Nexus One offer the functions that Apple has led them to expect?\nI'm on the fence myself, even though I never thought I'd be interested in anything but the iPhone.From my experience using the Nexus One, and from talking to people who have made the change, it's not necessarily about the differences between the iPhone and the Nexus One.The phones are extremely similar in design and general feel.Instead, the decision can be made based on the software  services you use on your desktop.\nMy friend Chad Dickerson received a pre-launch Nexus One from Google three weeks ago.He said Google's phone feels connected to certain services on the Web in a way the iPhone doesn't.\"Compared to the iPhone, the Google phone feels like it's part of the Internet to me,\" he said.\"If you live in a Google world, you have that world in your pocket in a way that's cleaner and more connected than the iPhone.\"\nPersonally, the phones work perfectly with their own software, but both of them don't make an effort to play well with other services.",
