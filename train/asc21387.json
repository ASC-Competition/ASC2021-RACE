At about two in the afternoon,Edison suddenly thought out a good way to solve the problem on the automatic telegraph after the wedding. So he said to the bride ,\"I'll have to go to the factory because I have something important to do. Then I'll come back to have dinner with you.\"The bride had no way but to agree.\nOn the night of the festival, other families were full of joy while the bride stayed in the house alone,just looking out of the window. How lonely she was!\nA worker went into the lab and said as soon as he saw Edison, \"My goodness! I have never seen a bride-groom like you. It's already twelve now!\"Edison was greatly surprised. \"Twelve? Too bad! I said I would have dinner with Mary.\"  he said as he ran downstairs.\nThat's how hard Edison worked.He gave all his life to the invention of lights, films and over two thousand other things. A new invention came into being every fifteen days.",
