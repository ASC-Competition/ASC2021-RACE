  "article": "A father sat at his desk and looked at his bills when his young son rushed in and announced: \"Dad, because today is your birthday and you're 40 years old, I'm going to give you 40 kisses, one for each year!\" When the boy started making good on his word ( ) , the father shouted:  \"Andrew, don't do it now. I'm too busy! \"\nThe boy soon fell silent as tears fell from his big blue eyes. Feeling sorry, the father said: \"You can finish later.  The boy said nothing but quietly walked away.\" That evening the father said:  \"Come and finish the kisses now, Andrew!\" But the boy didn't.\nUnfortunately, a few days later after the father's birthday, the boy had an accident and died.  His sad father wrote: \"If only(...,)I could tell him how sorry I am for my thoughtless words,  and how much my heart is hurting.\"\nLove is a two-way street.  We must warmly accept any loving act,  or others will take it as a \"NO\" and it can leave a scar . If we don't receive love, our life will lose its true meaning.  Nothing is more important than accepting love from those who are near and dear to us .\n,.",
