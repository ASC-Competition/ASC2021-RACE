  "article": "Today's Britain is full of TV shows like Fame Academy, which claim to offer young hopefuls an instant passport to fame and riches. But a very different kind of academy may provide a new generation of Brits with a slower, steadier path to wealth.\nA 'pig academy' in the east of England is aiming to train up new pig farmers to help promote local agriculture and meet the UK's growing demand for pork. Last year consumption of pork products increased by 6,000 tonnes. But British farmers have not benefited from this rise in demand. A combination of increasing feed prices, competition from cheaper imports and an outbreak of foot and mouth disease have all eaten into their profits. Pig numbers in the UK have actually almost halved in the last decade.\nNow, Fresh Start Pig Academy in Lincolnshire is launching a course which intends to redress   the balance. They say pig husbandry   is a growth industry and newcomers are welcome. For those of you who fancy _ , the course will teach you everything you need to know, from keeping pigs healthy to raising the capital needed to start up.\nPig farmer Anne Longthorp followed her father into the industry and believes that farming pigs is very rewarding work: \"They're great, curious animals to work with. Just watching their behaviour - it's really interesting work. There is a lot more to pig farming than people give us credit for. It's very scientific.\"\nSo, while most of Britain's young people may continue to dream of overnight stardom, others will hope a more traditional career will help them bring home the bacon.",
