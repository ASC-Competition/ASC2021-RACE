  "article": "Kendall Ciesemier is the founder of charity Kids Caring 4 Kids, an organization she created after seeing a show on the difficult situation of AIDS orphans   in Africa. Ciesemier was inspired to try to change the lives of those affected by AIDS and to encourage other children to do the same. She tells us of the power her personal story has in showing others they too can make a difference.\nYou saw Oprah's show on AIDS orphans when you were 11 -- do you remember how you felt?\nWhen I saw the show I was shocked. I had never heard of AIDS before and was concerned that kids were growing up without parents and no one had troubled to ask for my help.\nI wanted to create a place for kids to get involved and a place where their small contributions would be valued and celebrated. I also felt that I needed to take immediate action myself. I found an orphan sponsorship   program online and an eight-year-old girl from Mauritania who needed my help. I started there and Kids Caring 4 Kids grew from that experience.\nHow has your own illness inspired you to help others?\nGrowing up with a rare liver   disease made me feel different, which I think attracted me to others who were different and those struggling with something. I knew how I felt and I wanted to help reduce that feeling in someone else. I always wanted to support people. Growing up with an illness gave me empathy   for others.\nHow does your own story inspire others?\nMy own personal story is evidence that people can give from anywhere. I started Kids Caring 4 Kids from a hospital room. I started by helping one person and it snowballed from there. When I share my story, I think that's what affects people the most -- the fact that I started all of this during a time of personal struggle and weakness. If I could do that, then they can do something too.",
