  "article": "Social media is one of the fastest-growing industries in today's world. A study conducted by the US think tank   Pew Research Center showed that 92 percent of teenagers go online daily.\nThe wide spread of social media has changed nearly all parts of teenagers' lives.\nChanging relationships\nHigh school student Elly Cooper from Illinois said social media often reduces face-to-face communication.\n\"It makes in-person relationships harder because people give attention to their phones instead of their boyfriends or girlfriends,\" Cooper said.\nThere's also a greater possibility of things getting lost in translation over social media.\n\"If half of your relationship is over social media, you don't really know how the other person is reacting,\" Sienna Schulte, a junior student from Illinois, said.\nYet, some people believe social media has made it easier to start relationships with anyone from anywhere. Beth Kaplan from Illinois met her long-distance friend through social media. He currently lives in Scotland, but they're still able to frequently communicate with one another.\n\"I can feel close to someone that I'm talking to via   FaceTime,\" Kaplan said.\nWanting to be \"liked\"\nThe rise of social media has changed the way teenagers see themselves.\nThe 19-year-old Essena O'Neill announced on the social networking service Instagram that she was quitting social media because it made her obsessed   with appearing perfect online.\nNegative comments also can do great damage to a teenager's self-esteem  .\nIn particular, anonymous   social media apps such as Yik Yak may provide opportunities for cyber bullying  .\nThe app allows users within 5 miles (8 km) to create and add comments to everything. Teenagers who get negative comments on these sites can't help but feel hurt.\nOpening new doors\nHowever, Armin Korsos, a student from Illinois, takes advantage of the comments he receives over social media to improve his videos on the social networking site Youtube.\n\"Social media can help people show themselves and their talents to the world in a way that was never possible before,\" Korsos said.\nBut Korsos recognizes that social media has become a distraction  .\n\"Social media, though it helps people connect with their friends and stay updated, is not all necessary.\"",
