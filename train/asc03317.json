  "article": "If you haven't played games with an 80-year-old couple, you're missing out. Each week, my best friend and I hang out with senior citizens. Volunteering at a retirement village provides us with a great opportunity to meet new people and enrich the lives of the people we meet. We have learned so much from talking with senior citizens, and we are blessed to have this opportunity to reach out to those in our community. Nothing is more rewarding than seeing the faces of the elderly light up when we walk into the room.\nThough my school only requires 10 community service hours, I have continued to volunteer throughout high school. While our 10-hour requirement is a good start, schools should require more volunteer hours. Volunteering offers students an irreplaceable way to help their communities and expand their knowledge of the world.\nSome believe that forcing students to volunteer is defeating the purpose of volunteering, because it's not volunteering if you are required to do it. However, sometimes students need an extra push to reach out to their communities. It's because some students don't know the benefits of volunteering. After they start volunteering, they'll realize that volunteering can benefit them a lot and they will want to volunteer more.\nThrough volunteering, I've learned many valuable life skills. Besides teaching valuable life skills, volunteering may lead to a part-time job opportunity as well. If students prove their reliability and hard work ethic while volunteering, employers may take that into consideration and offer them a job. My best friend got her summer job after volunteering several summers at the Boy Scout camp.\nThere are various other benefits of volunteering. Besides making a difference in people's lives, students develop communication skills and acceptance of others. What's more, reaching out to others who are less fortunate teaches us to be grateful for what we have.\nAll in all, volunteering is an extremely rewarding activity which should be required.",
