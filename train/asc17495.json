  "article": "There are only 24 hours in a day,but people can use the time wisely. In other words,effective   time management is important if you want to succeed.\nKnowing the importance of daily matters is the first step towards good time management. Write down the things that you want to do and organize them according to their level of importance. The important thing should be done first. If there are too many things that have to be done in one day, then you have to give up doing something that is less important on your list.\nBesides this,you need to spend a specific   amount of time doing all the activities you have written down and make sure you finish them on time. People often slow down in their work even though they know that time will never wait for them. Make sure you keep to your plan and finish the tasks one by one. Do not try to do too many things at once.\nAlso,you can group similar activities together and do them one by one. For example, you can group all the tasks you need to do in the office together and do them while you're in office. Do all the tasks that have to be done in one place first, and then move to the next place to do the other tasks.\n\"The bad news is that time flies. The good news is that you're the pilot, \"said Michael Althsuler. Your future is in your hands,so remember to invest   your time wisely from today on.",
