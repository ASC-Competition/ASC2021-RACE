  "article": "It's hard to be the bearer of bad news,but most of IKEA's print and digital fascinating shots of picturesque rooms and products are fake.Those beautiful,\"natural-looking\" photos of gorgeous rooms and kitchens are mostly the work of computer magic,adjusted and corrected until they're picture-perfect.\nMartin Enthed,IT manager for IKEA's in-house communications agency,revealed,\"In 2012,12 per cent of its product and concept images was CGI-rendered,increasing to 25 per cent in 2013.Since then,that percentage of rendered images appearing in the company's catalogue and online has tripled.75 per cent of the furniture company's product images today are created by computers.\"\nIt's a move that first caught the attention of photographers and graphic designers a few years back when the furniture giant announced it would cancel photoshoots in favor of computer-generated imagery(CGI).\nEnthed said IKEA began shifting equipment in 2009 when company officials called in his team and said they weren't pleased with some previous photos and CG images.\n\"So we looked at all the images they said weren't good and the two of three they said were great,and the ones they didn't like were photography and the good ones were all CG,\"Enthed said.\"Now we only talk about a good or bad image - not what technique created it.\"\nIt's a not-so-secret strategy used by top companies specializing in home and furniture design,though many consumers remain oblivious.\nThe company claims the shift is another way to reduce its environmental footprint,saying constructing digital files produces less waste.It also helps the home furnishing empire's pocketbooks.",
