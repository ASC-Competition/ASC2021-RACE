  "article": "Hong Kong businesses hit by nearly two months of illegal street occupations breathed a collective sigh of relief on Wednesday. Police finally cleared illegal protesters camped at the main intersection in the Mong Kok district, arresting two student leaders.\nMore than 7,000 officers backed bailiffs (,)clearing occupied sections of Argyle Street and Nathan Road. The two-day operation saw 148 people arrested for various offenses, including contempt   of court, resisting arrest, possession of offensive weapons, unlawful gathering and attacking police.\nThe Chief Leader Stephen Hui said 22 officers were injured during the clearances.\nPolice used pepper spray and batons  to keep protesters from reclaiming cleared roads and from spreading the illegal occupation to neighboring streets.\nSix-lane Nathan Road, which goes through the heart of Kowloon, was cleared after nearly five hours. However, comments on the Internet said protesters were looking to reoccupy roads later in the evening.\nThis week's actions mark the first time the authorities have successfully cleared one of the three main protest sites, which sprang up after demonstrators seized key intersections in late September to press for unconstitutional reforms.\nContractor Kwan Sui-sum, 55, said he wished the Nathan Road clearance had come earlier, as he has had to pay HK$20,000 ($2,580) after the protesters delayed building reconstruction work. The owner of the Chung Hing Duty Free drug store was cautiously optimistic and eager for his store at the corner of the cleared intersection to get back to business. Sales dropped by 40 percent during the occupation, he said.\n\"I'm not worried about the guess that the protesters will return. I trust in Hong Kong's rule of law and in the police,\" the man said, who wished to remain unknown as he fears attack from protesters.\nBut five stores at a cleared site owned by jewelry chain Chow Tai Fook were still closed hours later. A company spokesman said the outlets will remain shut while it continues to monitor the situation.",
