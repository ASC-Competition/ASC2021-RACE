  "article": "Henry Ford was born on a farm on July 30th, 1863. The farm was near the city of Detroit.\nHenry was always interested in machines. He enjoyed fixing clocks.And he helped repair farm equipment. When Henry was sixteen years old, he left the family farm and went to Detroit to learn more about machines. Henry used what he learned from work to develop engines. In 1903, he was ready to start building cars for the public. On July 15th,  1903, a man named Doctor Pfenning bought the first car from the Ford Motor Company.\nThe sale to Doctor Pfenning was the beginning of a huge number of requests for Ford cars.By the end of March, 1904, almost 600 Ford cars had been sold. At the start of 1905, the Ford Motor Company was producing 25 cars each day.\nHenry Ford was sure the future of the automobile industry was in a low-priced car for the general public. He said then, and many times after,\"I want to make a car that anybody can buy.\"\nIn 1907, Henry Ford said: \"I will build a motor car for the great mass of people. 1t will be large enough for the family, but small enough for one person to operate and care for. It will be built of the best materials. It will be built by the best men to be employed. And it will be built with the simplest plans that modern engineering can produce. _",
