  "article": "In Britain, children go to school from Monday to Friday. School usually starts nine o'clock in the morning and finishes at about three o'clock in the afternoon. Most schools ask their students to wear a school uniform.\nSchool always starts with registration. What is registration? Every child going to school each morning and afternoon is recorded  in a special book. The teacher reads out each child's name in turn. On hearing his/her name, the child makes a reply  and the teacher writes in the book. From the book, you can see whether  the child is in school or not.\nAt 9:10, children go to the meeting place. There they sing songs, listen to a story and pray .\nThe first lesson begins at 9:20. They have break time from 10:20 to 10:35. During break time, the children have a snack and play games outdoors. After that, they go back in for another lesson until lunch at 12:00. Afternoon lessons begin at 1:10 and end at 3:15, and children go home. They don't have a break in the afternoon.",
