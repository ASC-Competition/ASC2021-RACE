  "article": "Sometimes ideas do not appear when you are concentrating your attention and mysteriously appear when you are not. Modern science recognizes this as a result of incubating  the problem in your subconscious , yet can't account for why it occurs.\nWhen you quit thinking about a subject and decide to forget it, your subconscious mind doesn't quit working. Your thoughts keep making associations(,). This is why you've experienced suddenly remembering names, getting solutions to problems you've forgotten about, and ideas out of the blue when you are relaxing and not thinking about any particular thing.\nYou may try solving a problem with your subconscious mind by writing a letter to it. Now let go of the problem. Don't work on it. Forget it. Do something else. This is the incubation stage when much of what goes on occurs outside your focused awareness, in your unconsciousness. Open the letter in two days. The answer might magically pop into your mind.\nAn advertising agency was under pressure to come up with a marketing campaign. Bert, the creative director, wrote the following letter which he addressed to his subconscious mind.\nSecret Expert,\nI need to come up with a new marketing program to introduce a new season of television shows. I'm interested in some kind of campaign that will capture the audience's attention more than one time. Is there something people need that we can advertise on? What kind of products, foods and services should we investigate? I need your idea about a fresh approach to advertising.\nThanks, Bert\nBert mailed the letter to himself and when he read what he had written, he got his brainstorm, which was to advertise on \"eggs\". Somehow an association between \"foods\", \"need\" and \"fresh approach\" inspired the thought of using \"fresh eggs to advertise.\" He arranged to put the ad for the television shows on eggs -- some thirty million.\nThe consumers look at a single egg at least a few times, when they buy the eggs at the store, when they transfer(,,) them to the refrigerator, and when they crack them open. It's unlike any other ad medium in the world, because you're looking at it while you are using it.",
