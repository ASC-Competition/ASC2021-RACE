  "article": "John liked to wear his hair very long. Some of his friends thought it looked like a girl's hair, but they never made jokes about it, because John was a big strong man and he didn't think jokes about his hair funny.\nJohn always went to the barber's twice a month to have his hair cut and washed, and one day the barber said to him. \"Now why don't you let me cut most of this hair off and make your head tidy? Nobody will recognize you if I do that. I'm sure.\"\nJohn said nothing for a few seconds and then he said, \"perhaps you are right, but I am sure that nobody will recognize you, either, if you do that to my hair.\"",
