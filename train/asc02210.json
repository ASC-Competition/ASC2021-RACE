  "article": "In October 2013, Davion Only made an appeal on the Internet. He had learned that his biological mothr had died not long before. \"My name is Davion and I've been in foster care   since I was born,\" he said, \"but I'm not giving up hope. \"\nThe heartbreaking appeal spread quickly, and Only's foster agency received calls from more than 10,000 people. Only ended up travelling to Ohio to live with a family. But after Only got into a physical fight with one of his elder would-be brothers, the family changed their minds.\nBack in Florida, Only passed through four different temporary homes over the following year, until he called Connie Going, his adoption case worker, to make a special request. Only had known Going for nearly ten years, and had asked every year if she would adopt him, but she always hesitated. \"I always believed there was a better family than us out there,\" Going said in an interview. But last July, when Only called and asked again if she might adopt him, Going said something felt different. \"When he asked me, my heart felt this ache and I just\nknew he was my son,\" she said.\nSo Going, 52, invited Only to start spending time with the rest of her family-her two daughters, Sydney, 21, and Carly 17, and a son Taylor, 14, who she also adopted out of foster care.  Eventually, after seeing how well the arrangement was working, Going, who had rented a bigger home, started adopting Only. Only moved in with her family last December.He officially joined Going's family on April 22, 2015 when the adoption papers went through.\n\"Today, I feel blessed and honored to have been chosen to be the parent of all my children,\" Going said.",
