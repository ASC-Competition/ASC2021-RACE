  "article": "Since the beginning of time never has there been another with my mind, my heart, my eyes, my ears, my hands, my mouth. None that came before, none that live today, and none that come tomorrow can walk and talk and move and think exactly like me. I'm a unique creature.\nVain attempts to imitate others no longer will I make. Instead will I place my uniqueness on display in the market place. I will begin now to highlight my differences; hide my similarities.\nI am rare, and therefore I am valuable. I am the end product of thousands of years of evolution; therefore, I am better equipped in both mind and body than all the emperors and wise men before me.\nBut my skills, my mind, my heart, and my body will weaken, rot, and die for fear that I put them to good use. I have unlimited potential. Only a tiny part of my brain do I employ; only a small amount of my muscle do I apply.\nSo never again will I be satisfied with yesterday's accomplishments nor will I lose myself, anymore, in self-praise for deeds which in reality are too small to even acknowledge. I can accomplish far more than I have, and I will. I am not on this earth by chance. I am here for a purpose and that purpose is to grow into a mountain, not to shrink to a grain of sand. Henceforth  will I apply all my efforts to become the highest mountain of all and I will strain my potential until it cries for mercy.\nI will increase my knowledge of mankind, myself, and the goods I sell. I will practice, and improve, and polish the words I speak to multiply my sales, for this is the foundation on which I will build my career. Also will I seek constantly to improve my manners and graces, for they are the sugar to which all are attracteD.\nI have been given eyes to see and a mind to think and now I know a great secret of life that all my problems, discouragements, and heartaches are, in truth, great opportunities in disguise. I am nature's greatest miracle. And nature knows not defeat. Eventually, she achieves victory and so will I, and with each victory the next struggle becomes less difficult.",
