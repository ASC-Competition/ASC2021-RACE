  "article": "Twenty years ago almost all nurses were women, and almost all pilots were men. Today women fly planes, and men care for patients. The jobs are the same, but not both men and women are working as nurses and pilots.\nThere are many other examples of changing job roles for men and women. Forty years ago there were no women news reporters on television.\nNow women report the news, the weather, and even men's sports. Women are reporting games and interviewing athletes. Fifty years ago there were almost no women lawyers or doctors, but today over half of all medical students are women.\nToday men teach very young children. Men work as librarians and secretaries. Some men stay at home to take care of the house and children. They are called \"househusbands\" or \"stay-at-home dads\". However, many women still work as homemakers.\nJobs are changing. Today men and women are working in every field.",
