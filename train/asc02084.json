  "article": "Crossroads International\nHow does Crossroads work?\nCrossroads is a resource network. We take goods Hong Kong doesn't want and give them to people who badly need them. We collect those goods and give them out in the welfare arena  in Hong Kong, Mainland China, elsewhere in Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. So Crossroads is just that: a Crossroads between need and resource.\nWho do we help?\nThe welfare agencies we help do not run on large budgets . They are grass-root groups who have seen a need and tried to meet it. They can't get the job done without back-up, though, so our task is to help them do their task. Our warehouse is full of goods, from computers to high chairs, clothing to books, stationery  to medical provision, cupboards to dinning sets. They send us a list of their needs and we try to match it with the resource we have in stock.\nHow do we operate?\nCrossroads itself also operates on a low budget. We do not buy the goods we send. They are donated. Similarly, rather than raising funds for freight ,we ask transport companies to donate their services. Nobody in our organization receives a salary. Even our full-time staff works on a voluntary basis.\nThose that donate goods and services:\n*Factories*Manufacturers *Hospitals *Hotels *Householders\n*Offices *Other Charities *Transport Companies *Educational Institutions\nOne resource that we are always in need of is people. While we receive large quantities of goods and there is never a short supply of requests for them, we are always in need of hands to help sort and prepare them for shipping.\nWhat can I do?\nWe are always in need of people. We have a lot of tasks. If you are volunteering regularly, we can offer work in some of the following categories, some of the time. You are welcome to number your top three choices and we will do our best to accommodate them.\n*Clothing categorization *Sewing *Toy categorization *Furniture handling\n*Driving *Book categorization *Household goods categorization *Office work\n*Electrical goods categorization *Book keeping *Fund- raising\n*Stationery categorization *Medical categorization\nWhere to find us?\nAll volunteer work is done at out warehouse:\nLocated in Basement Zone M of the Kai Tak Government Building\nOur warehouse hours: Tues.-Sat. 10:00am-5:30pm\nPostal address: 16 Man Tong, Silvermine Bay, Lantau Island, HK\nOffice details: Ph: 2984 9309, 2740 9657",
