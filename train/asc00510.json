  "article": "Warner Brothers has announced more Harry Potter movies are on the way. The studio is working with Potter author J. K. Rowling to create a new franchise   of movies based on \"Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them\", which is a fictitious textbook in the Harry Potter world. The story will also follow the adventures of the book's author, Newt Scamander. Rowling, for the first time, will pen the screenplay.\nIt comes as no surprise that Warner Brothers is trying to keep the Harry Potter franchise going. The films alone have earned $7.7 billion at the box office. The franchise has probably almost doubled those earnings on home video and TV sales. Then there's the many Harry Potter products that fans still _ .\nBut at some point, Harry Potter could seem old hat and that's not something Warner Brothers wants to see happen. So executives had three choices: restart the franchise, come up with continuations or spin off part of the Potter world into a new movie.\nWithout books to support the new stories, the upcoming movies could be a tougher sell for Warner Brothers. Harry and friends won't appear at all in the new movies which will be set in New York 70 years before Harry Potter heads to Hogwarts.\nThe new stories will also net video games, products and enhance Rowling's website.\nHere's Rowling on the upcoming franchise:\nIt all started when Warner Brothers came to me with the suggestion of turning \"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\" into a film. I thought it was a fun idea, but the idea of seeing Newt Scamander, the supposed author of \"Fantastic Beasts\", realized by another writer was difficult. Having lived for so long in my fictional universe, I feel very protective of it and I already knew a lot about Newt. As Harry Potter fans will know, I liked him so much that I even married his grandson, Rolf, to one of my favourite characters from the Harry Potter series, Luna Lovegood.\nAs I considered Warners' proposal, an idea took shape that I couldn't get rid of. That is how I could express my own idea for a film to Warner Brothers.\nAlthough it will be set in the worldwide community of wizards   where I was so happy for seventeen years, it is neither a previous work nor a continuation to the Harry Potter series, but an extension of the wizarding world. The laws and customs of the hidden magical society will be familiar to anyone who has read the Harry Potter books or seen the films, but Newt's story will start in New York, seventy years before Harry gets underway.",
