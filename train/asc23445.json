  "article": "Mr. Green once worked in a big company.He was quite busy so that he couldn't do any reading.So he gave up   his job and opened a bookshop in the center of the town.It wasn't big but all the books were nice and most people liked to buy some there.When the shop was closed,he could read at home.He knew a lot and many learned people were glad to make friends with him.\nIt was Sunday and it was cold outside.Mr. Green was very busy.At nine in the evening all the buyers left,but a woman was still there.She was dressed up and seemed to be waiting for somebody there. Standing by the shelves,she looked over the books one after another,and made them in a terrible mess .Mr. Green came up to her and asked,\" Excuse me,madam.What can I do for you?\"\n\"Your books are not interesting at all,\"said the woman,\"I want a delicious one.\"\n\"That's easy,\" Mr. Green smiled.He brought out a cookbook  and said,\"Here you are,madam.\"",
