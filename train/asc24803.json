  "article": "In Britain, some people say they will do anything if a famous person they love asks them to. One in three people in Britain have a new kind of disease --they love a famous person too much.\nSome people love famous stars like Britney Spears, David Beckham or even Tony Blair. It is not just the young, grown-ups have the same problem. One in four people are so interested in their heroes that it affects their life.\nThere are two ways of worshipping  famous people. One way is just to follow them or talk about them with friends for fun. The other is a more serious way. People have very strong feelings for them and think they are their friends. People who do so for fun are found to be happier. But those who have strong feelings for a famous person are perhaps to feel more lonely and worried.\n\"Worshipping famous people is not certainly a bad thing,\" Dr.John, an expert said, \"But like many things, overdoing it may not always be good for you.\"\n,,.",
