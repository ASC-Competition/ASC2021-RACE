I think I would.\nI read about an app   that helps people create a video to be published on a social-networking site only after death. Of course you don't need an app since it's easy to make your own video with smartphones, laptops and computers. But how many people do you know who would actually go ahead and leave \"If I die\" footage  ?\nMy father died unexpectedly on Christmas Eve three years ago and I've since longed for one more time to talk to him and hear his voice. Imagine if he had left such a video. I would see him again, hear his laughter and benefit from his parting words and advice.\nI don't think people, unless they have a terminal illness, go through life thinking they'd better leave a video in case of an _ death. But it is an opportunity to say all the things you want to say before it's too late.\nStill, some say that such a video robs loved ones of their own memories of you. Any special images they have would be superimposed   by the video image you've created. Others think it's scaring and might be tempting fate.\nI expect my video would consist of reminders to my children: Be safe; be[:++Z+X+X+K]mindful of your surroundings; exercise good judgment; speak up; it never hurts to ask; don't waste time and \"call when you get there\". And in addition, I would repeat what I always tell them: I need to know where you are, every-step-of-the-way. That would make them laugh.\nReaders, would you find comfort in knowing you've said your farewells and left something concrete for your loved ones? What messages would you leave for family and friends?",
