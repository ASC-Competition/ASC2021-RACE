  "article": "Mr. Green is quiet and doesn't like talking with people. He likes reading newspapers and playing computer games. He never exercises. Sometimes he watches soccer or basketball games on TV. He likes milk very much and drinks it three times a day.\nMrs. Green is a bank clerk .It's a busy but boring job. She works with people and money every day. So she is always tired after work. She likes to take a good rest and goes to bed early after dinner. Usually she goes to bed at 8:30 in the evening and gets up at 6:30 in the morning. Mr. Green is very happy with that. But Mrs. Green isn't, because Mr. Green always talks in her sleep.\nOne morning, Mr. Green sat at table and had breakfast. Mrs. Green asked him,\"Why do you always talk in your sleep?\"Mr. Green said,\"Because I have few chances to talk in the daytime \"\nThe next morning after their children all went to school, Mrs. Green asked Mr. Green angrily,\"Why did you scold me in your sleep last night?\"\"Because I'm afraid to do it when I'm awake .\"",
