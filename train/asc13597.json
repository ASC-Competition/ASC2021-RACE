  "article": "The Americans have been voted the world's \"funniest nationality\" ---the one \"best at making people laugh\" ---in a global poll  , which also names the Germans the \"least funny\" nationality and the British \"not as funny as they think\".\n30,000 people across 15 countries were asked to name both the \"funniest\" and \"least funny\" nationality in a poll conducted by Badoo.com, the world's largest social network for meeting new people, with 119 million users worldwide.\nThe Americans were voted the funniest nationality, ahead of the Spanish --- the funniest Europeans --- in second, Italians in third and British in seventh.\nThe voting for the \"least funny\" nationality confirmed the view of America's Mark Twain that \"a German joke is no laughing matter\". The Germans won, ahead of the Russians and Turks. The stereotype of German humourlessness is believed to _ from their reputation for efficiency, punctuality and rationality . Examples of German jokes include: \"Yesterday, I met my friend Horst at the hospital. He'd swallowed a sponge. He says it doesn't hurt but he's always thirsty.\"\n\"When we meet someone new, one of the first things we notice is whether they make us laugh\", says Lloyd Price, Badoo's Marketing Director. \"America is a worthy poll winner\", says Price. \"It's the world's only comedy superpower.\"\nThe British pride themselves on their humour but learn from the poll that they're not as funny as they think. They placed just seventh of 15 --- behind the Brazilians, French and Mexicans.",
