  "article": "Should we say goodbye to chivalry   in the age of sex equality?\nChivalry began as a response to the violence of the Middle Ages. PierMassimo Forni, the founder of the Civility Institute, says chivalry \"as a form of treatment inspired by the sense that there was something special about women and that they deserve added respect.\"\nToday \"chivalry\" is often used as a term for \"gentlemanly\" behavior, related to \"fair sex\", honor, courage and loyalty.\nBut we can hardly see chivalry nowadays with many women demanding to be treated equally in the workplace.\nAccording to a 2013 survey carried out by the British Daily Mail, only one in seven men will offer their seat to a woman on a bus or train; over three-quarters of men don't offer to help carry a heavy bag or suitcase for women.\nIn many cases, it's not because these men are being insensitive, but on the contrary, they say they are unwilling to help women because they are worried about making them embarrassed.\nThese men may worry too much. According to the same survey, only seven percent of women view acts like holding open doors as unpleasant.\n\"Men seem confused by the modern 'sex equality' message\", psychologist and relationship expert Donna Dawson told the Daily Mail.\n\"This message was meant for the workplace and was never meant to replace good manners. Men will always be the stronger sex physically, so it is natural for them to show consideration for women.\"\nSo, should the acts of chivalry be brought back? US writer Emily Smith says chivalry is what we should all long for. Many people are predicting the death of chivalry, but chivalry is not dead yet. Slowly but surely, chivalry is making a come-back.",
