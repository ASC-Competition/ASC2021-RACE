  "article": "It's easy to see how to help others, but what about those whose needs aren't so obvious? This story may have happened a while back, but it was a lesson which has stayed with me and helped me ever since.\nIt was Thanksgiving and I was volunteering with my parents at a shelter for the poor. We stood behind the counter dishing out hot food to whoever came in. most of our dinners looked like they had been having hard times, their clothes old, worn and dry. In short, they looked poor!\nThen, a man came in, who looked anything but poor. He was well dressed, wearing an expensive suit. I wondered what he was doing there and my jaw dropped in amazement when he joined the line for food. The closer he came to my service station, the more I muttered. What was this man doing? I wanted to know. Surely he wasn't gong to take food.\nThen my mother quietly took me to one side. She said, \"You have assumed that the needs of the people who come here must be purely physical: hunger, inadequate shelter and needs are emotional? What if he needs comfort, friends, or just to be among other human beings?\" her words hit me like a ton of bricks! I felt like I should apologize to the man, but I didn't.\nAbout a week later the shelter received a large donation from an anonymous source. I can't help but wonder if it came from that man.\nNow, whether I meet others, I remember my mother's words and try to send kindness and blessings to them, regardless of how they look.\nNeeds aren't always visible. But kindness always makes a difference.",
