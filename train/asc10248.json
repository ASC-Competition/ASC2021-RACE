  "article": "Be positive about school! Don`t say things are difficult or boring. Be interested in school life and your school subjects. Join lots of activities. Be quick to put your hand up. Go round the school with a big smile.\nExpect to work. School is not a holiday camp. If you are not working, you are not learning, and you are wasting your time at school. Teachers cannot make everything enjoyable.\nKeep fit. If you do not eat a good breakfast, you will be thinking about food in class. If you go to bed late and do not have enough sleep, you will be sleepy in class. Play some sports to keep your body strong.\nDon`t be too disappointed if things sometimes go badly. Everyone _ some tests, lose some matches and has bad days. Friends are not always perfect, and they sometimes say and do unpleasant things. Don`t let small problems seem very big and important.\nTalk about problems. Sometimes they are only the result of misunderstanding. Don`t be too embarrassed to ask for help. You are young. No one thinks you can do everything.",
