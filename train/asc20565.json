Please do not leave rubbish bags out before Tuesday as birds and animals can break into them and they smell.\nWashing\nThere is a washing line for every flat in the garden next to the car park. Please only dry your washing on these lines so it does not disturb people in the ground floor flats.\nCleaning\nThe main stairs are cleaned twice a week by the Association, so please try to keep them tidy and clean and do not leave furniture or bags on the stairs or in the hallways.\nLights\nThe main lights are on a timer and they stay on for five minutes whey you press them. Please tell the Association if any lights are not working.\nNoise\nResidents are asked to keep noise to a minimum. Loud music, etc. can disturb other people and the Association will get in touch with you if you make too much noise.\nSafety\nMake sure the main outside door is always locked and do not let anyone in to the main building unless you know who they are. Sometimes people try to get in to the main stairs and then break into flats, so do not let people in unless they are coming to see you.\nParking\nEach flat has one car parking space. These are numbered and are at the back of the building. Do not use another resident's space. If you have more than one car you will have to park it on the road. Do not park where you are blocking entrances.\nProblems\nIf you have any problems or questions, please call the Association at 0800 096 9000.\nParkrise Housing Association",
