  "article": "They are the little sweeties who look pretty cute in a photo, or when sleeping--but a lot less appealing at 30, 000 ft, crying loudly in the seat right next to you.\nAccording to a new survey, almost seven in ten Britons dislike flying with babies so much that they would like to see child-free areas introduced on planes. As for long-distance flights where people want to sleep, almost one in four British travelers believes that no-kid-zones should be fixed as required sections.\nThe survey was conducted by bookings website LateDeals.co.uk, with 1,108 UK consumers questioned as to what they hate most about air travel.\nAnd our dislike of noisy children and babies on planes runs deep, it seems.\nMore than a third of us--35 percent--would pay extra to travel on a childless service.\nLong-distance passengers would be prepared to pay an additional PS63 to the cost of a return ticket if it meant adults only on board. And on short-distance flights, an extra PS28 on the price of a return fare would be considered good value if it guaranteed an absence of angry babies in the middle of the economy-class aisle .\nHowever, screaming babies are not the only source of annoyance for British travelers. In fact, according to the research on the most annoying types of airline passengers, a crying baby ranks as only the fourth. Over half of those surveyed--58 percent--selected \"drunk travelers\" as their _ . People with \"bad personal hygiene \" and travelers who kick the back of the seat in front were also near the top of the list, causing anger to 48 and 47 percent of us respectively .\nCrying babies came in at fourth on the list, a pet peeve for 43 percent of those surveyed.",
