  "article": "A supermarket checkout operator was praised for striking a blow for modern manners and a return to the age of politeness after refusing to serve a shopper who was talking on her mobile phone.\nThe supermarket manager was forced to apologize to the customer who complained she was told her goods would not be scanned unless she hung up her phone. Jo Clark, 46, said, \"I don't know what she was playing at. I couldn't believe how rude she was. When did she have the right to give me a lecture on checkout manners? I won't be shopping there again!\"\nBut users of social media sites and Internet forums  were very angry that store gave in and the public appeared to be supporting the angry checkout worker. \"Perhaps this is a turning point for mobile phone users everywhere. When chatting, keep your eyes on people around you. That includes people trying to serve you, other road users and especially people behind you in the stairs,\" said a typical post.\n\"It's time checkout staff fought back against these people constantly chatting on their phones. They can drive anyone crazy. It's rude and annoying. I often want to grab someone's phone and throw it as far as I can, even though I am not a checkout girl, just a passer-by,\" said another.\nSiobhan Freegard, founder of parenting site www. Netmums.com said, \"While this checkout operator doesn't have the authority to order customers to switch off their phones, you can see clearly how frustrated and angry she felt. No matter how busy you are, life is nicer when you and those around you have good manners.\"",
