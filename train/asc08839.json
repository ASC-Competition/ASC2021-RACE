He became involved with the local rugby scene, and for the past three years is back in his chosen field as a relief firefighter with the Fredericton Fire Department.\n       \"I've met so many great people since I've been in Fredericton, and this is a very special day for me and my family. I'm happy to be a Canadian, but I'm also glad that I still hold dual   citizenship in Western Samoa as well.\"\n       The citizenship ceremony was overseen by a number of dignitaries , including Lt.-Gov. Hermenegilde, Chiasson, MP Andy Scott, Mayor Brad Woodside and John Barrett, director of operations for Citizenship and Immigration Canada.\n       Chiasson joked by welcoming the new Canadians \"to the country that invented ice skates, maple syrup and the case of beer with the built-in handle.\"\n       The day was also special for Jean-Jacques Tshimenga, his wife Sarah, and their three children, formerly of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n       \"Canada Day is the day to celebrate the independence and freedom that we have in this country,\" he said.",
