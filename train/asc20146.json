  "article": "Can you write down a Chinese word being read to you? Sometimes it can be difficult when you find the word is not included in most dictionaries.\nLu Jialei, 14, from Hangzhou Foreign Language School, won the CCTV Chinese Character   Spelling Contest on Oct 18th, 2013. About 160 people competed. The host read a word to the contestant, explained its meaning and gave sample sentences. The contestant was required to write down the word.\nWinning the contest was a \"surprise\" to Lu. \"I was not the smartest one,\" she said. \"But I paid attention to details.\" To prepare for the contest, she and her teammates studied the Modern Chinese Dictionary for 10 days. There are more than 56,000 entries   including characters, words and phrases in it. She also had a secret weapon. She studied how Chinese characters were formed.\n\"When others paid attention to the plot of a story, she looked at how authors use words and sentences to express themselves,\" said Su Yunsheng, Lu's Chinese teacher. Su is happy to see students like Lu find the beauty of Chinese language.\n\"Besides using something Chinese and having Chinese traditional festivals, learning to write Chinese characters is also an important part of inheriting   Chinese culture,\" said Su.",
