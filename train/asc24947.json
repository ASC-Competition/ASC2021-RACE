  "article": "A rich American went into a shop in London. He wanted very much to buy a nice looking watch, but the owner of the shop asked five hundred dollars for it. Suddenly a young man came into the shop, took the watch out of the owner's hands and ran out with it. It all happened in a few seconds. When the owner ran out into the street, the young man was already lost among the people.\nThe American went on. At the next corner, he saw the young man with the watch in his hand. \"Do you want to buy a fine watch, sir?\" he asked in a low voice. \"It's only a hundred dollars.\" \"The young man doesn't know I saw him stealing the watch,\" he thought. The American paid at once and went back to his room with the watch. He told his friend about the fine watch.\nHis friend took a look at the watch and started laughing. He said, \"You are a fool. This watch isn't worth even ten dollars. I'm sure the shop owner and the young man planned this together.\"",
