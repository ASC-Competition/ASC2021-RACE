  "article": "The food on the moon has come a long way from the freeze - dried bread to half - dried food. They have changed a lot in the past few years. And now US scientists want to grow vegetables in mini - greenhouses on the moon.\nScientists say they are looking forward to a time when people on the moon or even Mars will be able to eat green and fresh vegetables. Paragon Space Development Corporation has shown people what it called the first step toward growing flowers - and finally food - on the moon.\nParagon, which is a partner of NASA in experiments at the International Space Station, calls it a \"Lunar Oasis  \"\nThis is a closed greenhouse placed in a metal box. It is designed to safely land a laboratory plant on the moon surface, and protect it while it grows.\nThe small greenhouse is to be sent up into space by Odyssey Moon Ltd, which takes part in the Google Lunar X Prize. This competition offers $ 20 million to any company which can send up, land and operate a lunar rover   on the moon surface.\nLeaders of Paragon say future testing of the \"Lunar Oasis\" will be driven by Odyssey's flight schedule, which will not happen until 2012 at the earliest.\nWhen it is sent up, the greenhouse will have the seeds   of cabbage inside it. Because they go from seed to flower in just 14 days, they can complete their life cycle in a lunar night.\n\"Growing plants on the Moon or Mars seems so far away, but it is important that we do this research now,\" Paragon president Jane Poynter said. \"It takes a long time to do a lot of research.\"",
