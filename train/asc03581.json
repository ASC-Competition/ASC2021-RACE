  "article": "I had worked long and hard on this project. Knowing it was finally completed gave me great satisfaction. \"Perfect!\"I said \"Now, all I have to do is to keep the dogs off it.\"I went about setting . Up barriers using old fence, deck chairs, planters, and anything I could find so as to avoid footprints both on the oil paint and our carpet . It worked perfectly .\nJust before returning to the house and to a much needed shower, I took one last look at this fine work of art. \"What is that?\"I said. \"Where did that come from ?\"\nClearly marked and evenly spaced across the entire area, the tiny marks ran in straight lines. .I carefully stepped to our flower garden. It was there I found several of the small markings. Now, almost frozen in place by this shocking discovery, I remained in position so as to prevent further damage to my work.. Just then, off to my left, it appeared. A chipmunk  . He was as surprised as I was . We stood there face to face looking at each other, wondering who would make the first move .\nThe warm , humid air was now getting the best of me . Sweat now ran freely over my head, and in poor timing into my eyes . I reached up to rub them and when I opened my eyes he was gone .\nMy only satisfaction was in thinking that when he returned home he tracked oily footprints into his own home . And , hoping he was married , his wife would not let him live it down for the rest of his life . I stood up, shook my head, laughing about it and walking into my house.\nYes, I tracked oil on the carpet. I am married. My wife will not let me live it down for the rest of my life .",
