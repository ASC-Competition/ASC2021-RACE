  "article": "Mitsuaki recently arrived in the United States to enter university.He wants to do well in his studies and fit the new culture.But Mitsuaki has a problem.It's not his teachers.It's not even his English ability.His problem is that he doesn't have a car.Mitsuaki has already discovered a basic fact of American culture: Driving is a way of life.\nThere are different transportations in America.Many cities have taxis, buses and subways. But most people find it the easiest to drive, even if they do have to deal with heavy traffic. Nowadays busy families often have more than one vehicle.Many people think their car as a status symbol.But no matter what their social status are, people without wheels feel stressed.\nWhen Mitsuaki first arrived, he was amazed at how young many American drivers there were.Young people in America often get their driver's license around age 16 by passing a written test and a driving test.Before they can get their license, they have to take a driver education course, For teenagers, being able to drive is important. It's hard to find an American teenager without one.\nMitsuaki finally decides that he needs a car. His host family helps him find a good used car to buy. But before he gets his license and starts driving, he has to understand the American style of driving, He also needs to learn some of the basic rules of the road that good drivers follow.\nDriving to Americans is what flying to birds.It's almost part of their nature.For many Americans, being behind the wheel is like their natural home.But if they don't drive carefully, they can become an endangered animal.",
