  "article": "It was a cold night. The taxi driver didn't take even one passenger all day. When he went by the railwaystation, he saw a young man coming out with two bags in his hands. So he drove to him and asked, \" whereare you going ,sir?\n\"To the Red Hotel,\" the young man answered. When the taxi driver heard this, he didn't feel happy anymore. The young man would give him only three dollars because the hotel was near the railway station. Butsuddenly, he had an idea. He took the young man through many streets of the big city.\nAfter a long time, they arrived at the hotel. \"Here we are! You should pay me fifteen dollars, please.\"the taxi driver said to the young man. \"What? Fifteen dollars! Do you think I'm a fool? Only last week, Itook a taxi from the railway station to this hotel and I only gave the driver thirteen dollars. I know how muchI have to pay for the trip.\"",
