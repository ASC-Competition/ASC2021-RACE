  "article": "An interesting experiment is taking place at the Children's Hospital in London. Dogs, cats, and even horses help sick children to get better. Dr. Marcus Finch of the Children's Hospital says,\"Children have many problems as they are growing up. When they have problems, it's not easy for them to open up. But when they are with a pet animal, they feel relaxed and always smile. Animals don't speak, so they don't criticize .They listen and don't stop children. Children can talk with animals because they can believe them. Animals know how to keep secret! Also, children feel they are needed  because they help to feed  the animals and look after them.\"At the Children's Hospital, you can find children playing with cats, dogs, and goats,and riding horses. The doctors just watch them and are surprised at the power of the animals.",
