  "article": "Henry was from the United States and he had come to London for a holiday.\nOne day he was not feeling well.  So he was to the clerk at the desk of his hotel and said, \"I want to see a doctor. Can you give me the name of a good one?\"\nThe clerk looked in a book, and said, \"Dr. Grey.\"\n\"Is he expensive?\"\n\"Well,\" the clerk answered, \"he always asks for his patients two pounds for their first visit to him, and 1.5 pounds for later visit.\"\nHenry decided    to save 50 pence. When he went to see the doctor he said, \"I've come again, doctor.\"\nFor a few seconds the doctor looked at his face carefully without saying anything. Then he nodded and said, \"Oh, yes.\" He examined   him and then said, \"Everything's going as it should do. Just continue  with the medicine   I gave you last time.\"",
