  "article": "When Iain Douglas-Hamilton first started studying elephants in Africa,he had to invent ways of tracking the big animals. Over the course of 40 years in the field, the zoologist learned how to fly airplanes and use some high-tech means to follow their movements. He also learned how to get out of the way fast. \"I learned how to climb trees very quickly,\" says Dr. Douglas-Hamilton, winner of the 2010 Indianapolis Prize.\nAs co-founder of Save the Elephants, he has also learned to be an activist, author, and politician. When Douglas-Hamilton left Tanzania, in East Africa, in 1970 to study at Oxford University in Britain, he left behind \"an elephants' paradise  .\"But when he returned in 1972, the country's national parks looked more like a war zone. Douglas-Hamilton often found more dead elephants than living ones.\nDr. Douglas-Hamilton now lives in Kenya with his wife, Oria, who co-founded Save the Elephants. Together they have written two books, \"Battle for the Elephants\" and \" Among the Elephants\".\nDuring the height of the ivory poaching  ,Douglas-Hamilton flew in small planes, helping bring back elephants in Uganda from the edge of extinction. He's been repeatedly shot at and has survived plane crashes, floods and diseases. He fought for years for a worldwide ban on ivory sales, which finally took effect in 1989.\nDouglas-Hamilton pioneered the scientific study of elephant social behavior. Among his discoveries: Elephants have a society controlled by female elephants and travel in families. In 2009, he worked to save a rare group of desert elephants in Mali from the worst dry weather in Mali's history. There have been other successes, particularly in East and Southern Africa. Douglas--Hamilton has proposed   the idea of a mobile national park, where the protected land would follow elephants as they travel. No country has yet accepted it.\nEven after decades of research, Douglas-Hamilton still enjoys the company of elephants. \"I love to sit with them and be with them, \"he says. \"I have the greatest joy just to be with elephants at peace.\"",
