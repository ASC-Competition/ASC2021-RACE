  "article": "All hotels redecorate regularly. However, very few do it as frequently as Sweden's Icehotel. As the name indicates,the hotel that is located in the remote village of Jukkasjarvi, is built entirely from ice and,therefore,has to be rebuilt annually! The 26th version of Icehotel, which welcomed its first visitors on December 11th,features 69 rooms. To make them affordable for everyone, they range from expensive luxury suites to basic accommodations.\nAmong this year's unique suite offerings is the\"Elephant in the Room\",which features a massive 3-m tall sculpted African elephant overlooking an ice--framed bed. The\"Counting Sheep\"suite features frozen sheep that may help those who don't sleep well get a good night's rest. Though the atmosphere between the luxury suites and the budget rooms may differ,they are all subject to the bone-chilling-5degCtemperatures. To get a good night's rest guests have to lie inside sleeping bags and keep their gloves and hats on. Though that seems a little uncomfortable,visitors say it is an experience like none other.\nThe hotel also features a beautifully crafted ice church where over 100 couples will get married this year and an Ice Bar that will serve drinks in ice glasses. Though dining options are limited to the hotel's only restaurant,guests will have little to complain about with Michelin--trained chef Alexander Meier. To keep customers entertained,the hotel offers a variety of fun activities like snowshoeing,moose or snowmobile safaris,dog sledding,and even overnight wilderness camping.\nThe 26-year-*old tradition began accidentally in 1989 when locals organized an art exhibition to draw winter visitors to the remote village that lies 200 km north of the Arctic Circle. Among the many tourists was an adventurous group and they announced their intention of spending the night in the place where the exhibition was being held. That's when the idea of building the icy accommodations dawned on the locals.",
