  "article": "The US will have a new president this fall. Voters will decide between the Democratic candidate  , Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump of the Republicans.\nBut the voting is not a must for each person in the US. So quite a lot of people choose not to vote, especially the young generation. According to Fox News, one-in-five young voters between the ages of 18 and 35 said clearly that they wouldn't vote for either of the two candidates. Just 12 percent of voters aged 35-54, and only nine percent of voters aged 55 and older said the same thing.\nThis is not only because young people don't like Clinton or Trump, according to theFortunemagazine. The truth is that they are traditionally less likely to vote than their parents.\n\"Young people are not at an age in their life when they think politics or government has anything to do with them,\" said Rodd Freitag, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, US. \"But for the older age groups, they have a home, they pay taxes  , they care about schools and the community.\"\nMany believe that the civic   education of an American youth is another reason why they don't vote.\nStudents usually just do community services like cleaning the neighborhoods. This means they haven't learned how to link real life problems to politics through voting, according to Christopher Beem, a politics professor at the Pennsylvania State University.\nHe said the country needs to help young people learn how to take part in politics and get them to see that they can make a difference.",
