  "article": "Liu Jiaoyang, 16, carefully winds a bobbin  with thread, places it on her sewing machine   and then presses her foot down to begin sewing.While she' s doing this, she pretends to guide fabric  through the machine.Liu looks forward to the class when she can work on a piece of real cloth, and make a beautiful dress.\nEach Tuesday afternoon, after the bell rings for the fourth period, Liu becomes a fashion designer.At the same time, the rest of the students at the High School Attached to Yunnan Normal University in Kunming are also having classes a little bit different from the usual ones.Some students dance, others create robots, and still others review films.These are just a few of the other 27 elective   courses besides Liu's sewing class that the school began to offer last month.\n\"The fashion design class has become the bright point of my week.I learn how to choose colors and fabrics   as well as sewing and sketching   skills.It's all helping me to realize the dream of becoming a fashion designer I' ve had since I was a little girl, \" Liu said.\nDesign is Liu' s favorite, but for other students the electives are interesting lessons which relieve   the pressures of schoolwork.Some students, for example, are learning how to play bridge.Chen Xi,15, is one of them.She said, \"Many people think that playing a card game like this in class is a waste of time.But in fact, bridge is a very challenging game that helps develop memory and math skills.\"",
