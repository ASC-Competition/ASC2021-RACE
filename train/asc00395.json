  "article": "Would you like to be an actor, but aren't the right age or physical type for the part? Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting.\n _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud.\nVoice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours.\nLike other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part.\nRickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\" says Rickey. Later, the recorded words, music, and sound effects are combined with the cartoon art to create the cartoon we enjoy on TV. Sound interesting? Maybe you can have a \"voice\" in acting after all!",
