  "article": "It is not clear who first fried potatoes in hot oil. However, it is widely agreed that French fries  were prepared as early as the 1700s in Europe. Most people believe that it was the Belgians  , instead of the French, who invented \"French\"fries. They think that French fries got this name from the cooking word \"to french\" --- to cut green beans into long thin strips  .\nWhen Thomas Jefferson traveled to France, he enjoyed the deep-fried potatoes very much and brought them home with him. Ever since he served French fries to his guests at a Whitehouse dinner in 1802, the dish has become very popular in America.\nIn the summer of 1853, an American Indian called George Crum worked as a cook at Moon Lake Lodge, a hotel in Saratoga Springs, New York. He was good at making French fries. One evening, a dinner guest found Crum's French fries too thick and sent them back to the kitchen. Crum then cut and fried some thinner French fries, but _ . This time, the cook got angry. So he decided to play a trick on the guest. He finally made fries that were too thin to eat with a fork. To his surprise, the guest loved the browned, paper-thin chips. The browned chips, then called Saratoga Chips, became one of the most popular dishes of the hotel. Soon they were being sold, first in local restaurants, then throughout New England.",
