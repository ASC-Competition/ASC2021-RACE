  "article": "Before fridges, homes usually had ice boxes. But another way to keep food cool without electricity is to use an evaporative   cooler. It is easy to make and does not even use ice.\nA common design is a tall box with several shelves inside. The shelves are pieces of metal with many small holes through them. The sides of the box are covered with pieces of thick cloth. Containers of water are placed at the top and bottom of the cooler. The ends of each piece of cloth lie in the water so the cloth stays wet.\nPut the cooler in the open air but not in the sun. Air will pass through while the inside of the box will stay several degrees cooler than the outside. This can keep foods fresh for a short time.\nThe best way to prepare foods for storage   is at harvest time. Place the harvested items on a clean surface, but not on the ground. Fruits and vegetables must be cool from field heat before they are stored. A good idea is to harvest foods either early or late in the day, then leave them to cool naturally. Do not remove outer leaves from fruits and vegetables before storage.\nSome fruits and vegetables must be stored at zero to four degrees Celsius. Any colder, and they might be damaged. Others need four to eight degrees, and still others above eight degrees. Cover the items in plastic once they reach the right \" _ \" for storage.",
