  "article": "I usually doubt about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago.While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, 1 was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children between 9 and 17 have a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago.\nWhy are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation   brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place.\nGiven that _ , adults can still do plenty to help the next generation to cope.\nAt the top of the list,nurturing   is a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress.\nTo help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later.They will then have more time for face-to-face relationships, and they will get more sleep.\nLimit the amount of virtual   violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news.\nKeep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale.\nMake exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you deal with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable,but it doesn't have to ruin your life.",
