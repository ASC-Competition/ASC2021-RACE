  "article": "One morning last summer Joyce Andrews made some sausage sandwiches for her husband's lunch. There was one sausage left over. Mrs. Andrews didn't care for them herself, and so she gave the last one to Henry, their little dog, Henry ate it up quickly.\nDuring the morning the dog got ill. He wouldn't stop shaking his head, and couldn't stand properly. Joyce thought, \"He's eaten something that didn't agree with him. Maybe that sausage very bad...\" she suddenly remembered her husband's lunch. She ran to the telephone and called Jim at office.\n\"Jim, I hope you haven't eaten any of those sandwiches yet.\"\n\"You have Two? Well, listen--don't eat any more. I gave Henry the last sausage, and new he's ill. Go to the doctor, Jim.\"\n\"What? You feel all right? No, Jim, don't take a chance with your health. I'm sure the sausages are bad. Please go...\"\n\"Yes, Jim. Tell him about the dog. Get some medicine.\"\nJim came back at lunch time and went to bed. \"I had a very unpleasant hour at the doctor\" he told Joyce, \"and the medicine made me very sick.\"\nThe next morning Jim was fine. Henry seemed quite fit again, too. At eleven o'clock milkman came with the milk.\n\"Morning, Mrs. Andrews,\" the milkman said \"How's your dog this morning? I've been thinking about him...\"\n\"Have you? Well, he seems all right now, but...\"\n\"Yesterday morning he and I had I a little accident. He jumped up at me, and I dropped a bottle of milk on his head.\"",
