  "article": "Philip Pullman spent a great deal of his childhood traveling abroad because both his father and stepfather were pilots in the Royal Air Force . As a child, he went on several long ocean voyages, and he lived in Africa and in Australia. \"Before I was 11 I had been to eight different schools.\"\n\"In Australia, I made a great discovery. TV hadn't reached Australia yet, but everyone listened to the radio. I remember listening to gangster serials , and cowboy serials, and best of all--Superman! When I first saw a superman comic , it changed my life. I'd been reading books for a long time, but I'd never known comics before. Soon afterwards, I discovered Batman, too, whom I loved even more.\"\nPullman started writing his first novel the day after he had finished his final exams at Oxford University. \"I discovered after about an hour that it was much harder than I'd expected. It still is! I found that the amount I could write comfortably every day was about three pages, so that's what I've done ever since.\"\nBefore he became a full-time writer, Pullman had been teaching for many years. \"What I enjoyed most during that time was telling stories over and over, until I knew them as well as I knew my own life.\" He had always loved telling stories--as a schoolboy he had entertained his friends by reading stories to them, or by making up his own.\nOne day he got a letter that had arrived at his door even though the writer of the letter didn't know his address. The envelope  just said, \"Philip Pullman, The Storyteller, Oxford.\"",
