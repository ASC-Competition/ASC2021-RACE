  "article": "The key to happiness is how quickly you can get back your focus on what`s important.\n----Anonymous\nSixteen years ago I learned this lesson in the back of a New York City taxi cab. Here`s what happened. I hopped in a taxi,and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane when,all of a sudden,a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver slammed on his brakes,skidded,and missed the other car`s back end by just inches!\nThe driver of the other car,who almost caused a big accident,started yelling bad words at us. My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. And I mean,he was friendly.  So,I said,\"Why did you just do that?This guy almost ruined your car and sent us to the hospital!\"And this is when my taxi driver told me what I now call \"The Law of the Garbage Truck. \"\nMany people are like garbage (rubbish)trucks. They run around full of garbage,full of frustration, full of anger,and full of disappointment. As their garbage piles up,they need a place to dump it. And if you let them,they`ll dump it on you. When someone wants to dump on you,don`t take it personally. You just smile,wave,wish them well,and move on. You`ll be happy with what you did.\nI started thinking,how often do I led Garbage Trucks run right over me?And how often do I take their garbage and spread it to other people at work,at home,or on the streets?It was that day I said,\"I`m not going to do anymore. \"\nSuccessful people do not let Garbage Trucks take over their day. What about you?If you let more garbage trucks pass you by,you`ll be happier. Life`s too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So,Love the people who treat you right. Forget about the ones who don`t.",
