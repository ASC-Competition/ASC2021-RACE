Good prices .\" \"This sounds like a good idea,\" he thought. \"I'll spend a month at\nWillow Farm. I'll enjoy horse riding, walking and fishing. They'll make a change from sitting by\nthe seaside.\"\nFour days later he returned home.\n\"What's wrong with Willow Farm?\" his friend Jack asked him. \"Didn't you enjoy country\nlife?\"\n\"Country life was fine,\" Alan said, \"but there was another problem .\"\n\"Oh, what?\"\n\"Well, the first day I was there a sheep died, and we had roast mutton   for dinner.\"\n\"Fresh meat is the best.\"\n\"I know, but on the second day a cow died, and we had roast beef for dinner.\"\n\"Lucky you!\"\n\"You don't understand,\" Alan said. \"On the third day a pig died and we had roast pork for\ndinner.\" '\n\"A different roast every day,\" Jack said.\n\"Let me finish,\" Alan said, \"on the fourth day the farmer died and I didn't dare to stay for\ndinner!\"",
