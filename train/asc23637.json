Won't you sell it to me?\"\n\"How much would you give me for it?\" the farmer opened his eyes and asked.\n\"Twenty dollars. Would it be enough?\"\nA few minutes later,the farmer agreed.After he paid the farmer,the man said,\"My cat will feel thirsty.May I take the bowl so that the cat can have milk?\" But the farmer said, \"I'm sorry I can't give it to you.Thanks to the bowl,I can sell twenty cats.\"",
