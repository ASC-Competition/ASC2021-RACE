  "article": "He Made It!\nOne Sunday, Gavin, a teenager, went skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine. In the early afternoon, when he was planning to go home, a fierce snowstorm swept into the area. Unable to see far, he accidentally turned off the path. Before he knew it, Gavin was lost, all alone! He didn't have food, water, a phone, or other supplies. He was getting colder by the minute.\nGavin had no idea where he was. He tried not to panic. He thought about all of the survival shows he had watched on TV. It was time to put the tips he had learned to use.\nHe decided to stop skiing. There was a better chance of someone finding him if he stayed put. The first thing he did was to find shelter from the freezing wind and snow. If he didn't, his body temperature would get very low, which could quickly kill him.\nUsing his skis, Gavin built a snow cave. He gathered a huge mass of snow and dug out a hole in the middle. Then he piled branches on top of himself, like a blanket, to stay as warm as he could.\nBy that evening, Gavin was really hungry. He ate snow and drank water from a nearby stream so that his body wouldn't lose too much water. Not knowing how much longer he could last, Gavin did the only thing he could -- he huddled   in his cave and slept.\nThe next day, Gavin went out to look for help, but he couldn't find anyone. He followed his tracks and returned to the snow cave, because without shelter, he could die that night. On Tuesday, Gavin went out again to find help. He had walked for about a mile when a volunteer searcher found him. After two days stuck in the snow, Gavin was saved.\nGavin might not have survived this snowstorm had it not been for TV. He had often watched Grylls' survival show Man vs. Wild. That's where he learned the tips that saved his life. In each episode   of Man vs. Wild, Grylls is abandoned in a wild area and has to find his way out.\nWhen Grylls heard about Gavin's amazing deeds, he was super impressed that Gavin had made it since he knew better than anyone how hard Gavin had to work to stay alive.",
