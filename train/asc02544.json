  "article": "One day in my class, the children were busy preparing for the coming concert. Suddenly Patty came up to me and said, \"Every year I-g-g-g-get to be a quiet student. The other kids are always in a p-p-p-play or something. This year, I w-w-want to recite a p-p-p-poem myself!\"\nWatching her eager eyes, I had no way to refuse her request. So I had to promise her that she would have a \"reciting\" part. That promise proved to be very difficult to keep. None of my books had any proper poems for her. So I had to spend most of the night writing a poem for her. It was not excellent, but it was enough to cope with Patty's speech problem.\nFrom then on, Patty spent a lot of time practicing the reciting every day. With my help, she made great progress. However, an unexpected thing happened when the concert was about to start. The MC came to me with anger, waving his printed program. \"There has been a mistake! You have listed Patty for a recitation. That girl can't even say her own name without stuttering.\" Because there was not enough time for explanations, I said to him angrily, \"We know what we are doing.\"\nThe concert was going very well. When it was time for Patty's recitation, the MC again said that Patty would embarrass everyone. Losing patience, I shouted to him loudly, \"Patty will do her part. You do yours. Just introduce her number.\"\nThe curtain parted to show Patty, excited and confident. In perfect control, Patty uttered each syllable clearly helped by my gestures. At last, she made her bow, with tears in her eyes.\nThe curtain closed. At first silence held the audience, then the silence gave way to warm and lasting applause. Patty threw her arms around me and said to me excitedly, \"We d-d-d-did it!\"",
