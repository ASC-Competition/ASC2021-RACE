  "article": "I was loading   my truck to go to the market when I hurt my left eye. The pain was like a hot sword  being shoved through my head. I fell down on my hands and knees, and I knew it was bad.\nI was taken to the Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga, and the doctors operated on me several times but couldn't save my left eye. When they told me the news, I wanted to die.\nEven after I got my fake  eye, I couldn't shake the sadness. To make matters worse, I lost my job as a transportation officer because of my lost eye. But one morning, I woke up and the TV was on, and there was a 16-year-old girl who had been badly burned on her face and legs. Her situation was much worse than mine. She wore a big smile and seemed to look right at me and said, \"You can't ever give up.\" At that moment, I thought, \"This is just an eye. Get over it.\" And I did.\nIt's been almost 12 years since my accident, and there's nothing I can't do now that I used to do. And although I didn't get my old job back, I got my license again.\nI read a story once. In that story, a man was feeling bad because he had no shoes until he met a man who had no feet. No matter how terrible your problem is, remember there's always someone somewhere who's worse off. So cheer up and smile at life!",
