  "article": "Jose, a young musician, is a rising star in Bolivia. He has already performed in some of the countries' top venues  including the Legislative Palace. What's so great about that? Jose is just seven years old and he is blind!\nJose is musically talented. At the age of 4, he picked up the drums and showed surprising talent. Later he moved on to the piano and his musical talent became undeniable . By the age of 5, Jose had formed his own jazz trio . \nThe young boy knows every jazz song in his book and can play _ all with great confidence. And it is not the only kind of music he enjoys. He also loves listening to blues, heavy metal, etc.\nRoberto Montano is clearly a proud father when speaking of his son Jose. He said that he had nothing to do with his son's unusual talent. In fact he didn't even know much about jazz until Jose started to play. He believes the young boy is just born with a \"music chip\"   inside him.\nAlthough Jose is a rising superstar, he lives a life like other children do. Just like his classmates, he goes to school, does homework and even does chores at home.",
