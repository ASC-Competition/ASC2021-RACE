  "article": "A group of kids at McIntyre Elementary School, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, have created a special bench to make sure their fellow classmates aren't left out on the playground. Called the \"Buddy Bench\", students can use the seat as a safe and supportive place to let others know they'd like to be included in playtime, but may be too shy to ask.\nThe concept of the Buddy Bench is simple: Students who want to partake in playground games and activities, but may feel hesitant, can take a seat, which signifies  to other children on the playground that they may need something extra to encourage them to participate.\nThe idea for the bench came about last year, when Farrell, school counselor at McIntyre Elementary, was conducting a leadership group to help students overcome shyness and gain confidence. Four fourth-grade students came up with the idea for the Buddy Bench in this workshop, and worked with Farrell to draft a letter to present to the Parent Teacher Staff Organization to make the bench a reality. The PTSO approved the students' proposal, and installed  a bright metal bench with a cheerful sign that reads \"Buddy Bench\" on the school's playground.\nSince it was installed on Nov. 16, the bench has been effective. The simple concept has resonated with  the students, and already has created a better environment within the school community.\n\"Each day, I go to see the buddy bench working,\" Farrell said. \"The lessons _ are learning now will benefit them their entire lives. It is simply a beautiful example of kids wanting to be kind and continue to be kind every day.\"",
