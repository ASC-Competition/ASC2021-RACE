  "article": "China's long-awaited rules on school bus safety finally came into force on Tuesday, including a list of ways aimed at reducing the risk of accident.\nAmong the biggest changes is that buses carrying students will be given priority  in traffic, while companies and drivers will need licenses to offer school transport services.\nOfficials have spent more than four months making the rules, during which time the country has been shocked by several big crashes because of overcrowded school buses.\nThe latest accident happened on Monday in Yangchun, Guangdong province, in which three kindergarten pupils were killed and 14 others injured.\nRules and funding\nIn the new rules, a school bus is considered as a vehicle with more than seven seats that is transporting children receiving the State's nine-year compulsory education (ages 6 to 15) to or from school. This can also be for preschoolers  if a parent is unable to take them to or from kindergarten .\nSchool buses must also operate in routes marked in the map by governments to ensure safety.\nPunishment\nCompanies and bus drivers who fail to meet the rules face the punishment.\nDrivers against the rules will be fined 200 yuan ($32) and vehicles will be taken away from its owner if they have been used as an unlicensed school bus.",
