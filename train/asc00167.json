  "article": "An electric signal can trick a monkey's brain into believing the animal's finger has been touched.\nTouch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something.\nA person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.\nThe sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs.\nIn their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys  . The scientists implanted electrodes  --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't.\nThe monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched.\nThe new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built. The new study also offers \" a nice clear pathway\" for figuring out how to restore a sense of touch to an amputee  or someone with a injury of spinal cord.\nThe study shows how artificial limbs might be connected to the brain so that a person can \"feel\" with such a prosthesis  . But such a supersensory device doesn't exist yet and scientists have a lot of work to do before people will benefit from it. Researchers must first figure out whether the electrodes would work in people in the same way they do in monkeys.\n\" I think the foundation is laid for human trials,\" Bensmaia said.",
