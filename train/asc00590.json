  "article": "I realized that I was getting cold, and felt it was probably time to go back to the apartment, so I put my collar up against the wind and began to walk back up the cold street. I managed to get some food from a vendor , and walked on.\nAbout twenty-five minutes later I knew that something was wrong. It was getting very, very cold, there were no streetlights, and the hill I was hoping to see on my right was nowhere in sight.  There was almost no light except for mysterious red crosses shining from the tops of churches, and I was beginning to get worried.  To cut a long story short, I had walked the wrong way from a crossroads, and had wandered miles in the wrong direction. My head was aching from the cold, and I couldn't think straight. Turing around, I started back, and a long time later was outside the house I had set off from. It was at about that time I realized that I had a gate key but no house key.  How happy I was when I found that the front door was open--my only piece of good luck that day.  My apartment was of course locked, my head felt like it was about to explode, and my hands and feet were freezing.\nI tried turning the handle.  No luck.  I tried another key from England.  I wanted to avoid waking the family downstairs, so despite the fear of an early death from cold, I couldn't break the door down.  What would my hosts think? I pulled an ATM card from my pocket and forced it alongside the inside of the lock. I didn't think it would work, but after fifteen minutes of trying, I heard a click.  Another couple of minutes later the door was open.  Relieved, I took off my clothes in the dark and got into bed.",
