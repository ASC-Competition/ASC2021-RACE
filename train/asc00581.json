  "article": "Women are on their way to holding more than half of all American jobs. The latest government report shows that their share of non-farm jobs nearly reached fifty percent in September, 2009.\nThe job market continues to suffer the effects of last year's financial crash. On the one hand more women have entered the labor market over the years, and on the other hand the economic recession   has hit men harder than women. In October the unemployment rate for men was almost 11% compared to 8% for women.\nIndustries that traditionally use lots of men have suffered deep cuts. For example, manufacturing   and building lost more jobs last month. But health care and temporary employment services have had job growth. Both of those industries employ high percentages of women.\nThirty years ago, women earned sixty-two cents for every dollar that men earned. Now, for those who usually work full time, women earn about eighty percent of what men earn. And a recent study from the University of California, Davis, reveals that women hold fifty-one percent of well-paid management and professional jobs. Yet the study also shows that men still hold about nine out of every ten top positions at most companies. The results have remained largely unchanged for five years.\nAlso, a new research paper in the journalSex Roleslooks at the experiences of women who are the main earners in their families. Rebecca Meisenbach at the University of Missouri in Columbia interviewed fifteen women. She found that they all value their independence and many enjoy having the power of control, though not all want it. But they even feel more pressure and worry. That is partly because of cultural expectations that working women should still take care of the children. Also, men who are not the main earners may feel threatened.",
