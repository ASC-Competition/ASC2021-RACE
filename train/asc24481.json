Then he reads an English book and listens to the radio for about one hour. After that he starts to do his homework. At about 11:30, he often cooks   lunch for his family. In the afternoon, he usually plays volleyball with his friends. Sometimes he goes to the library in the afternoon. He loves his weekend very much.",
