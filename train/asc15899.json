  "article": "Here's an unusual story:a diamond ring was recently found in an egg. The magician,Liu Qian,discovered it,in front of an audience of millions at CCTV's Spring Festival Gala. Liu's magic tricks have made the centuriesold art of magic fashionable once again,and made him the hottest magician in China.\nAs a _ young magician from Taiwan,Liu is popular worldwide for his magic shows. Countries he has performed in include the United States,Japan,South Korea and the UK.\nWitnessing something impossible happen right before your eyes is the root of people's love for magic.\nLiu is known for his interaction   with his audiences. He has a unique understanding of showmanship  .\n\"It's actually thinking rather than one's manipulation   skills that is more important to achieving a successful magic show. We think carefully about how to design the shows creatively,to make them appear more interesting.\"Liu said.\nLiu Qian's success dated back to his childhood. Born in 1976 in Taiwan,he found himself attracted to a magic toy in a shop when he was seven years old. At the age of 12,he won Taiwan's Youth Magic Contest,which was judged by the great American magician,David Copperfield.\nYet,Liu never planned on becoming a professional magician. He studied Japanese literature at university and only hoped to be an amateur   magician in his spare time. However,his failure to find a proper job after graduation pushed him towards magic as a career.\nTo refine his performing skills,he has performed on streets,roads and fields for passersby,policemen and farmers.\n\"Street shows are the biggest challenge for us magicians. We have to deal with unexpected situations and tough crowds,\"Liu said.",
