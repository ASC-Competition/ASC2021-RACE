  "article": "As an American artist and writer of children's books, Tasha Tudor's art and nineteenth-century\nlifestyle have fascinated adults and children for decades. She received many awards and honors for her contributions to children's literature. When people talk about her creativity in artwork, she said, \"I do it to support my dogs and my four children.\" Her great publishing record, the number of magazine stories that have been written about her over the years, and her admirers have no effects on her at all.\nMuch of Tasha's artwork and her reading are done in the wintertime. \"I love winter. It's delightful,\" she says. \"I don't have to go anywhere because I work at home. If I'm snowed in, I can stay this way for months.\" She hopes for early, deep snow to protect her garden from the hardship of the New England winter, and when it comes she puts on snowshoes when she needs to get down the mile-long dirt path that leads to the road.\nGiven her enjoyment of winter and her fantasy way of life, it's not surprising that Tasha's Christmas is a storybook holiday. She hangs flowers over the front door. Her tree comes from the woods, and it goes up on Christmas Eve, lit by homemade candles and decorated with her great- grandmother's collection that dates from 1850. In a place of honor on the tree are large cookies cut into the shapes of her animals.\nThe grandchildren and friends get presents from Tasha's old dolls; so do the animals and they have their own Christmas tree. \"Of course, it's a known fact that all the animals talk on Christmas Eve,\" she has written. Small, handmade gifts fill a big wooden box.\nAt the end of each year, Tasha can look back and know that her life is perfect, that she has again ignored the twentieth century, and that the magic continues. And for the rest of us,here's a bit of advice, Tasha style: \"Nowadays, people are so restless. If they took some tea and spent more time rocking on the porch  in the evening listening to light music, they might enjoy life more.\"",
