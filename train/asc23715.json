  "article": "School education is very important and useful. The students both learn knowledge and get an education. Yet, no one can learn everything from school. The scientists,such as Edison,Newton,Galileo and Einstein, didn't learn everything from school. They learned a lot of knowledge outside school or in practice by themselves. A teacher, even he knows a lot, can't teach his students everything.\nThe teacher's job is to show his students how to learn, how to read and how to think. A good teacher with rich experience in teaching can teach his students the methods(=\" ways)of\" study. Through these methods the students are able to learn and get a lot of things by themselves.\nUsually it is very easy for the students to remember some knowledge, but it is very difficult to use it for problems. If a teacher really shows the students the ability of how to use knowledge, it means the teacher has learned lots of knowledge by himself (or herself). The success in learning shows he or she knows how to study.",
