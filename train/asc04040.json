  "article": "Weddings in the United States vary as much as the people do. There are church weddings with a great deal of fanfare ; there are weddings on mountain tops with guests barefooted; there have been weddings on the ocean floor with oxygen tanks for the guests. But many weddings, no matter where or how they are performed, include certain traditional customs.\nBefore a couple is married, they become engaged. And then invitations are sent to those who live nearby, their close friends and their relatives who live far away. When everything is ready, then comes the most exciting moment.\nThe wedding itself usually lasts between 30 and 40 minutes. The wedding party enters the church while the wedding march is played. The bride carrying a bouquet enters last with her father who will \"give her away\". The groom enters the church from a side door. When the wedding party is gathered by the altar, the bride and groom exchange vows . It is traditional to use the words \"to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part.\" Following the vows, the couple exchange rings. Wearing the wedding rings on the fourth finger of the left hand is an old custom.\nAfter the ceremony, there is often a party, called a \"reception\" which gives the wedding guests an opportunity to congratulate the new couple.\nThe car in which the couple leaves the church is decorated with balloons. The words \"Just Married\" are painted on the trunk or back window. And then the couple go in their honeymoon.",
