  "article": "Scientists think it will be possible to record people's dreams and then interpret them, according to a new report.\nThey claim to have developed a system which allows them to record higher level brain activity.\nDr Moran Cerf told the journal Nature: \"We would like to read people's dreams.\"\nPreviously the only way to access people's dreams is for psychologists to ask about them after the event and try to interpret them.\nDr Cerf hopes to eventually compare people's memories of their dreams with an electronic visualization  of their brain activity.\nHe told the BBC: \"There's no clear answer as to why humans dream. And one of the questions we would like to answer is when do we actually create this dream?\"\nThe scientist believes his latest research shows that certain neurons  or individual brain cells are linked with specific objects or concepts.\nHe found that a particular neuron lit up when a volunteer thought about Marilyn Monroe.\nIf a database was built up identifying various neurons with concepts, objects and people it would allow them to \"read the subject's minds\", according to Dr Cerf.\nHowever, Dr Roderick Oner, a clinical psychologist and dream expert, said that this kind of visualisation would be of limited help when it came to interpreting the \"complex dream narrative\".\nIn addition to get a detailed picture of individual neurons subjects had to have electrodes implanted  deep in the brain using surgery.\nThe Nature researchers used data from patients who had electrodes implanted to monitor and treat them for brain seizures .\nHowever, Dr Cerf said he hoped that it would be possible at a later stage to monitor people without invasive surgery. He said it would be \"wonderful\" to be able to read the minds of _ patients who are unable to communicate.",
