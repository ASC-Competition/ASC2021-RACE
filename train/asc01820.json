  "article": "These days a green building means more than just the color of the paint. Green building can also refer to environmentally friendly houses, factories, and offices.\nGreen building means \"reducing the impact   of _ on the land\"Taryn Holowka of the U.S Green Building Council in Washington, D. C. said.\nAccording to Holowka, buildings account for  65 percent of total U.S. electricity use.\nBut green buildings can reduce energy and water use. Also, the buildings are often located near public transportation such as buses and subways, so that people can drive their cars less. That could be good for the environment, because cars use lots of gas and give off pollution. Green buildings are often built on developed land, so that the buildings don't destroy forests.\nMarty Dettling is the project manager for a building that put these ideas into action.  The Solaire has been called the country's first green high-rise building. According to Dettling, \"We've reduced our energy use by one-third and our water by 50 percent.\"\nThe Solaire cuts energy in part by using solar power. \"On the lace  of the building we have solar panels which change the sun's energy into electricity,\" Dettling explained.\nThe Solaire also has lights that automatically turn off when people leave the room. In addition, the building has lots of windows, allowing people to use the sun for light during the day. The Solaire cuts water by reusing it.\nNot everyone is eager to move into a green building, however. Some people think that things like solar panels cost more money than more traditional energy sources. Anyhow, Holowka said, \"It's going to be big.\"",
