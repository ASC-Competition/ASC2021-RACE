  "article": "109-year-old Anna Ferris of Washingtonville kicks a soccer ball Saturday with the help of her grandson Joe Begendorf at the Orange County Senior Games. Ferris has been  _ at the event.\nShe was born on Feb. 11, 1900, in New York City, before the radio or crossword puzzle was invented.\nAnna carries the seasons lightly for her age. Family and friends say she walks around the house and sometimes does laps with her walker around the driveway to keep her legs strong.\n\"She's doing this well because we try to keep her out of the wheelchair as much as possible,\" said Begendorf, who helped steady his grandmother Saturday during each athletic event.\nLast New Year's Eve, she toasted 2010 by holding a glass of white wine high above her head at 1 am.\nBut the public legend of Anna Ferris began at last year's Senior Games when she finished the 100-meter dash with support only from her walker.\n\"When they said she was going to race last year, we thought it was a joke,\" said Anne Coon, co-chairman of the games. \"She walked away with a whole chest full of medals by the end of the day.\"\nOn Saturday, Anna threw a softball 16 feet and used a metal bat to hit a softball 15 feet off a tee . She threw a football more than 9 feet. She scored 10 points in \"crazy water bocce \".\nShe even tried soccer. Her first two kicks landed short of the goal and Anna shook her head in disappointment. But her third try rolled gently into the back of the net. That's when Anna Ferris smiled with the excitement of a little girl.",
