  "article": "For years people had told our founders, motivational speakers Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, inspiring stories about themselves. Jack and Mark included these stories in their talks, and their audiences repeatedly asked if they had ever been published. Eventually, Jack and Mark decided to collect the best 101 stories they'd been told and put them in a book. They called itChicken Soup for the Soulbecause they wanted it to provide comfort, just like their grandmothers' cooking.\nThey took the book to New York, hoping to sell it to one of the big publishers, but every single one turned them down. The project appeared to have _ until they met Peter Vegso. Peter read some of the stories and loved them, so he decided to give the book a chance, becomingChicken Soup for the Soulfounding publisher.\nChicken Soup for the Soulturned into one of the most popular and loved books ever published, selling 11 million copies around the world. Today, we've published more than 250 books andChicken Soup for the Soulhas become the best-selling trade paperback book series of all time.\nPeople have connected withChicken Soup for the Soulbooks deeply. Years ago, we started getting letters from readers asking for more, not just more books, but other things, too. Jack and Mark recognized thatChicken Soup for the Soulhad grown into something much bigger than the book series they had created. So, in 2008, William Rouhana, Amy Newmark and Robert Jacobs boughtChicken Soup for the Soulfrom them. Today, we have a line of comfort foods, including healthy and balanced pet foods. We're online now with our forums, apps and a YouTube channel. We're working hard on a newChicken Soup for the SoulTV show and a movie. Meanwhile, we are still collecting stories from our readers and the public, just like we've done since the beginning. We have new books coming out almost every month. We're always looking for ways to share happiness, inspiration and wellness through everything we do.",
