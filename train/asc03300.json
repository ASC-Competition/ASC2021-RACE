  "article": "A few years ago, I was on a plane with my friend, waiting for it to take off. The pilot's voice was heard throughout the plane: \"Sorry for the delay, ladies and gentlemen. Our engines don't work. We are going to jump-start them. Once we get them going, we'll get up in the air and see what happens.\"\nThat was all he said. \"See what happens?\" Shouldn't we have had a better plan than that? At that point. I could only laugh nervously. One woman started crying, \"Oh no! We are going to crash!'' There were sighs of hopelessness and anxiety, and we hadn't even taken off yet.\nThe pilot even seemed unhappy. He told us our one engine was working double time, and his plan was to get up in the air and see what happens! Then we did. We got up in the air, and what happened? Nothing. We arrived in Norfolk, and no sooner had the wheels touched down than applause burst out as everyone on the airplane breathed a sigh of relief.\nWhile I do prefer planning better than \"see what happens\" when it comes to flying, it really isn't such a bad idea for life.All too often, people stop trying to achieve their goals just because they don't have a guaranteed result. But success will never be guaranteed. The best thing that you can do is just get up in the air, and see what happens. If your effort is to build a business then get up in the air and see what happens! Don't give yourself all the reasons why you can't. Do not wait until you have everything you need. You never will!\nIf your goal is to start a friendship, say \"Hello\", get up in the air and see what happens! The results could be very rewarding.\nIf your goal is to learn a new skill, get up in the air and see what happens! It might not be as difficult as your think. It could be fun!\nWhen traveling, i hope that my pilot has a more detailed plan than \"we will see what happens\" . But in life, it is not a bad strategy at all.",
