  "article": "Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, \"Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. \"Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery .\nFor women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,\"People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. \" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time.",
