  "article": "Wikipedia is a free-access, free content Internet encyclopedia , supported and hosted by the non-profit Wikipedia Foundation. Wikipedia is ranked among the ten most popular websites and is considered the Internet's largest and most popular general reference book. Now, Wikipedia is becoming Wookiepedia as scientists hope the informative website will help us reach out to intelligent life forms. So aliens can learn about the human race.\nAstronomers would like to beam   the entire contents of Wikipedia into space in the hope of contacting aliens. They want to send messages to hundreds of star systems and planets 20 light years away using radio telescopes. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute, in California, wants to use powerful radio telescopes to try to reach Chewbacca and his mates in a galaxy far away.\nThe plans will be discussed by astronomers at the weekend as some scientists fear the reply from ET might not turn out to be friendly. Institute scientist David Black said, \"One question is if there are dangerous creatures we might be drawing their attention to ourselves. Another is if we go ahead, what message should be sent? There could be many civilizations out there,but if they are all listening and no one is broadcasting or responding, then nothing will happen.\"\nProfessor Stephen Hawking, who has warned that intelligent aliens probably exist and we should keep a safe distance from them, is among _ . \"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans,\" he said.\nSignals from Earth's radio and TV broadcasts have been heading out in space for some 60 years reaching around 5,000 stars.",
