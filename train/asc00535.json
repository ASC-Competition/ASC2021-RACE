  "article": "They crossed in front of me as I was driving out of the store parking lot  .I would be delayed for a whole ten seconds. However,I realized that it was an elderly couple who were briefly delaying my departure  .No more anger.\nThe man leaned on his wife who walked in front of him. He not only used her for support but it was obvious that he was blind. She was his eyes as well. The two of them worked as one--each needing the other to function in this fastchanging world.\nThat little example of true strength that day changed my whole personal perception of life. Suddenly I wasn't so mad about having to work a few extra hours on Saturday. I had my strength,and I was still relatively young.\nThat picture of those two elderly people walking with dignity and strength stayed with me the entire week. My life wasn't so bad after all. I had my health and a good job. My wife always gave me good advice whenever I needed it. I started to think--not only was I lucky to have it all,but so was that wonderful old couple,who,despite the trials and hardships of a long life,still had the love and support of each other to carry them through this world.\nThere are so many people out there just like that couple. My wife and I sometimes picture ourselves in our old age,walking arminarm into the sunset. That image always gives us a warm feeling of comfort. Just remember,none of us would be here if it weren't for our elders. We should spend an extra minute to listen and learn when it comes to helping our elder friends. They need it.",
