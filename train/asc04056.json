  "article": "Gabby Douglas stood beneath the Rio Olympic Arena, still in her Team USA leotard, trying hard to understand how she had become the most unpatriotic athlete in Rio. Tears filled in her eyes. She tried hard to talk but no words came out. Her pauses were long and uncomfortable.\n\"I've been trying to stay off the Internet because there's so much negativity,\" she said. The attacks against her have been everywhere these last few days. The bullies blamed her for not putting her hand over her heart while the US national song played. Besides, some other people attacked her for not jumping up and cheering hard enough for team-mates at the all-around final. All of this prompted her mother, Natalie Hawkins, to tell Reuters this weekend, that Douglas is \"heartbroken\".\nIt showed on Sunday, in Douglas's final performance of this Olympics and maybe in the Games ever. Douglas finished sixth in the uneven bars, far from the medal stand she owned four years ago in London, and shook her head, confused. What had she done wrong? Nothing made sense.\n\"I mean, you do [Olympics] for your country, and you do it for yourself, how have I offended them? What have I done? I was standing in respect for USA. I'm coming out there representing them to the best of my abilities, so how would I be in disrespect?",
