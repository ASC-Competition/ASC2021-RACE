  "article": "A father sat at his desk poring over his monthly bills when his young son rushed in and announced, \"Dad, because this is your birthday and you're 40 years old, I'm going to give you 40 kisses, one for each year!\" When the boy started making good on his word, the father cried out suddenly, \"Oh, Andrew, don't do it now; I'm too busy!\"\nThe youngster immediately fell silent as tears welled up in his big blue eyes.Apologicaliy the father said, \"You can finish later.\"\nThe boy said nothing but quietly walked away, disappointment written over his face.That evening the father said, \"Come and finish the kisses now, Andrew!\" But the boy didn't respond.\nUnfortunately, a few days later after this incident, the boy had an accident and was drowned.His heartbroken father wrote...\n\"If only I could tell him how much I regret my thoughtless words, and could be sure that he knows how much my heart is aching.\"\nLove is not only giving.Any loving act must be warmly accepted or it will be taken as rejection and can leave a scar.If we are too busy to give and receive love, we are too busy! Nothing is more important than responding with love to the cry for love from those who are near and precious to us, because there may be no chance at all as in the case of the little boy.",
