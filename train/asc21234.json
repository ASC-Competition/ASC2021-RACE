  "article": "An unpleasant habit of announcing the death of a celebrity has sprung in recent years, when in fact the subject is alive and well. The latest blatantly false was the supposed death of Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan from a heart attack.\nIt spread rapidly on the Chinese blogosphere and Twitter in the West, and there was even, supposedly, a message from US President Barack Obama paying homage to the martial arts hero. \"Jackie Chan is a man who can talk through talent, he is a constant reminder of the strength of humanity. He will forever be in our hearts, a true inspiration who inspired many generations,\"\nCruelly, it was the actor's son, Jaycee Chan, who had to prove if the news was true, by making a phone call and finding him, fortunately, \"busy as hell\" organizing, with other Hong Kong celebrities, a charity concert on Friday to raise money for those struck down by the earthquake in Japan. Jaycee Chan described the false news as an \"insane joke\", but Jackie Chan was not angry at the news. He said, \" It is not the first time to hear that I was dead.\"\nThe Hong Kong-based The Sun Newspaper reported on Wednesday that a blogger with the handle \"SKIPHOPZ\" was the source of the false news.\n, .",
