  "article": "Like every other Olympics, the London 2012 Olympics will depend upon thousands of volunteers to help with the smooth running of the event. To show the importance of the role, London 2012 volunteers are to be called 'Game Makers'. Lord Coe has said recently: \"London 2012 is relying on brilliant Game Makers to help us create a great Olympic and Paralympic Games. \"\nLondon 2012 Olympics volunteers will provide the face of London 2012, working behind the scenes and making sure the games are as well organized, efficient and, most importantly, as enjoyable as possible.\nDespite the hard-work and often unsociable hours required of volunteers, applications to be considered as a Game Maker were unprecedented  with all the 70, 000 available positions applied within days. But, for those still interested in helping out during 2012 and being in the middle of the action, there are still a lot of opportunities available.\nIf you were one of those who missed out on the chance of becoming London 2012 volunteers, you can now apply to be one of the 8, 000 London Ambassadors . This important role involves greeting fans from all over the world, welcoming them to the fantastic capital city of London and providing a friendly face as well as help, advice and a good old traditional warm British welcome. The view of London most visitors take away with them after the 2012 Olympics will mostly _ the volunteers and ambassadors, so these roles play a very important part in the process of making the UK a great place to travel to.\nBecoming a London Ambassador is a brilliant way to be involved with the London 2012 volunteers scheme and become a part of what should be an historic summer.",
