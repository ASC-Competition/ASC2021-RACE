  "article": "A dog who chewed off his owner's infected toe while he was passed-out drunk has been called a lifesaver. Jerry Douthett had been out drinking when his dog Kiko bit off a large part if his big toe. His wife, Rosee, rushed him to hospital where tests showed the 48-year-old musician had dangerous high blood-sugar levels. Doctors told him his toe would have had to be cut off anyway.\nMr Douthett said he had refused to get medical advice despite his toe being swollen for months. \"I was hiding it from people, Rosee included,\" he said. \"It smelled , and I look back now and realize every time we'd visit someone with a dog, their dog would smell all over my foot.\"\nThe night before Mr Douthett had agreed to see a doctor, he passed out at home after going out drinking. He said, \"I woke up and the dog was lying along side by foot. I said, 'Ah, there's blood everywhere.' I ran to the bathroom and started to scream.\"\nHowever, he believes Kiko could sense the disease coming from his big toe. \"He's a hero,\" Mr Douthett said. \"It wasn't an aggressive attack. He just ate the infection. He saved my life. He ate it. I mean, he must have eaten it, because we couldn't find it anywhere else in the house. I look down. There's blood all over, and my toe is gone.\"\nBefore the operation, Mr Douthett asked a nurse, \"Is there any chance I can get whatever's left of my toe, so I can give it to Kiko as a treat?\" Kiko is still with the family but is under observation by authorities.",
