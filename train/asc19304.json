Very few people would think of a library as a place to live in.\nOne library in New York City turned into a home for 250 people for a few days. These were all people near the library. They slept on the floor. Why did the people move into the library?\nThe people moved into the library because the city wanted to close it to save money. These 250 New Yorkers loved their library. They didn't want to lose it. So they moved in. They knew that the library couldn't be closed if they were living inside it. At last the city agreed to keep the library open, and the people all went home.",
