  "article": "Ricochet, a 19-month-oldgolden retriever , wasbred  to be a service dog but never made it. Now, she has found her role in the ocean, surfing with a disabled teen.\nPatrick Ivison, 15, suffered a severe injury in a car accident when he was 14 months old. He has been disabled since, but the Californian boy never gave up on the goal of walking. He recently took his first steps. When Ivison first met Ricochet, the two immediately hit it off. To raise money for Ivison's physicaltherapy , which is not covered by insurance, it was suggested that the pair take up surfing. Ivison said that when he first heard the idea he thought, \"We are completely out of our minds.\"\nBut from the start, the two took to surfing naturally. With the help of his mom, Jennifer Kayler, and friends, who carry Patrick to the ocean and guide the extra-large surfboard into the waters, Ivison rides the waves with his pal standing on the back. \"It's kind of like a grand performance out there,\" Ivison said of the group of people who help him out. The dog helps to balance out the board The teen remembered one pass when \"we were about to flip over and then she stepped on that side of the board and helped us out.\"\nThe two participated Sunday in the Surf City Surf Dog contest as afund-raiser . They wowed the cheering crowd during their exhibition. The event raised $8,200. About $2,000 will go toward a service dog for Ivison, and the rest will go toward his \"Help Patrick Walk\" therapy fund.",
