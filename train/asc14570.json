  "article": "Have you ever heard of blogs  ? If you haven't, you should have. It's here, it's growing and it's having an influence on our life. Surf the Internet and you'll find blogs everywhere. A blog, shortened from \"weblog\", is a public Internet journal written by one person or a group of people. It is a website in which a person or a group can place news, personal thoughts, text, photos, video or audio files, or links upon which visitors can comment. A blog lets you post on the Internet without having to know web design or be technical. You are given an environment to make dated entries on the topic of your choice which are \"published\", so other people can read them.\nAuthoring a blog, maintaining a blog or adding an article to an existing blog is called \"blogging\". Blogging has revolutionized Internet publishing in the last several years because it gives everyone with Internet access the opportunity to become an online writer. Objects, such as \"text and photos\" in a blog can be called \"blog posts\", \"posts\", or \"entries\". The person who posts these entries is called a \"blogger\".\nNow, somewhere around the world, a blog is created almost every 6 seconds. Because it's great potential, Bill Gates views it as important as e-mail, BBS, and MSN. He's trying to make blogs the important tools for future business communications.",
