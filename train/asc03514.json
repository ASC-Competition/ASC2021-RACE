  "article": "Having a great collection of books at home doesn't really mean that you are a person who has a   passion for literature and reading. It can be a family inheritance  or it can be just to impress people around you about the fact that you are a person of culture. On the other hand, there are many persons who cannot afford to buy books, because some of them are quite expensive, but they usually go to libraries and spend hours reading something that interests them a lot, or just borrow books to read at home. From my point of view, literature is very important in our lives from several points of view. For e xample, reading is a means of gaining culture and enriching our knowledge in different areas of activities. It can help us have a great imagination and it makes things easier when it comes to making compositions on different themes. It gives you the possibility to speak about science, even if you don't work in this field, or you can express your opinion about a political aspect, just because you have read something conne cted to that.\nSecondly, literature offers us the possibility to enter the world of imagination, and to leave apart the real one for a couple of hours. We come to meet kings and queens many years ago, dream in the world of the rich or imagine how life will be in the future. Sometimes, we identify ourselves  with the characters in the stories we read and they can give us some clues to solve our problems and how to react in certain circumstances. To conclude, I would like to say that literature is the perfect means to enrich our culture, to express correctly and have a rich vocabulary, to be able to interfere  in conversations in different fields of interest and to really be considered an erudite person.",
