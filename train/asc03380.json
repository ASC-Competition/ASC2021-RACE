  "article": "Letter One\nDear Editor,\nAfter I finish my homework, I often go online and chat with my friends. Sometimes I play Internet games. But my parents hate to see me playing games on the computer. Maybe they have heard too much news about how QQ and Internet games harm children. Once I went to a net bar to play games after school. But after that I told my parents that I was playing basketball at school. I said so because I didn't want to make them unhappy. I feel bad about it. However, I need to rest for a while by playing computer games after studying for a long time. I really want my parents to understand that. Do foreign parents do the same to their children? Please help me.\nLi Ping, Nantong\nLetter Two\nDear Li Ping,\nI think it's not strange for parents to keep their children away from anything bad. Foreign parents will do the same as your parents! They may not let their children watch TV for too long a time, or like your parents, they don't want their children to play computer games.\nTalk to your parents and be honest to them, I think. Tell them what you are doing and why you are doing so to make them understand you. _ They aren't fools as you think sometimes! Our parents seem to know what is the best for us. Remember: to be honest is the best way.\nGood luck,\nRebecca",
