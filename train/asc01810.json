  "article": "The day before yesterday, when Peter's family were having dinner, Father raised an interesting question, \"Was there anything in our past that we feel ashamed of, guilty about, or regretted? Maybe we can find ways to say sorry, or take some action to right any wrong doing.\" This seemed like a very private matter, but Peter thought about it carefully the whole night.\nPeter remembered an incident from middle school. In his school, there was a worker, Neil Stone, who none of the kids liked. One night, Peter and two of his classmates decided to play a trick on him. They found a can of red paint, and wrote on the school main road in bright red: Neil Stone is a fool! The next day, the whole school saw these words. Within two hours, Neil had Peter and his two classmates in his office. His classmates said that they had done it but Peter lied, denying the truth. No one ever talked about it.\nThis morning, Peter went back to his middle school. Neil Stone is still working there. \"Sorry, Neil. Do you still remember what happened ten years ago? I want you to know that I did it.\" \"I knew it!' Neil laughed. They had a good laugh and a lively discussion. Neil's closing words were: \"Peter, I always felt bad for you because your classmates got it off their mind, and I knew you were carrying it around all these years. I want to thank you for visiting me... for your sake.\"\nPeter knows that no matter how difficult the situation is, it is never too late to clear up the past and make a fresh start.",
