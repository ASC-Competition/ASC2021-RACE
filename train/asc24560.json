  "article": "You may know the English letters A, B and C. But do you know there are people called ABC? You may like eating bananas. But do you know there are people called \"banana persons\"? If you don't know, I will tell you. They are Chinese people like you and me, but they aren't in China. Why do people call them that?\nABC means America -born Chinese. An ABC is a Chinese, but was born in the United States. Sometimes, people also call them \"banana persons\". A banana is yellow outside and white inside. So when a person is a banana, he or she is white (American) inside and yellow (Chinese) outside. They are born in America and they live in America for a long time. Even their nationalities  are Americans. So they think like Americans and do things like Americans. But they still have Chinese blood. Their parents, grandparents or great-grandparents were from China. They all have black eyes and black hair. So they look like us, Chinese people. For example, we all know the famous scientist C.N. Yang . He is an ABC and he is a \"banana person\". We like him, although his nationality isn't Chinese.",
