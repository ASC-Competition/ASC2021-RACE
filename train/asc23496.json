  "article": "As a girl, I've spent a great deal of my time on earth concerned about my weight. So I do know something about exercise. Let me tell you about the calorie-burning activities I've tried or will try.\nSalsa  \nI try to maintain my weight through dancing. Dancing improves my coordination and sense of rhythm in addition to burning calories. I'm personally interested in salsa, which I find sexy and expressive . But I have not yet to start classes, because classes are very expensive, and I cannot find a dance partner.\nPing-Pong\nPing-pong is the national sport of China, so how could I know nothing about it?\nMy father is a ping-pong fan, and a really good player. He's won several informal   matches. My relationship with ping-pong has always been on-and-off. I'll get into it for a while, and then lose interest. The reason is because I can't find a good partner. Some stronger can depress you, while someone weaker (or just as weak) can make the game boring.\nTae Kwon Do  \nI've recently decided to try tae kwon do as my regular exercise activity. There's a story behind this choice: A few weeks ago, I was sitting on a bus, concentrating on a book. Suddenly, the bus became very quiet except for the sound of a woman's crying. I looked up to see what had happened and overheard whispers that she had just quarreled with a man, and the man slapped  her face. No one on the bus dared say anything because the man looked really strong. Even now I feel ashamed I was among the silent.\nThat's why I've made up my mind to learn something that will help me protect others and myself.",
