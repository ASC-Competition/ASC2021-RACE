  "article": "Strange Baby-Naming Laws\nGermany Parents are banned by law from using last names and the names of objects and products as first names. A child's first name must clearly indicate his or her sex, and all names must be approved by the office of vital statistics in the area in which the child was born.\nIceland The country's naming committee consults the National Register of Persons to determine if a name is acceptable. If parents want to go off-list, they must apply for approval and pay a fee, and the name must contain only letters in the Icelandic alphabet.\nNew Zealand The country's Births, Deaths, and Marriages Registration Act of 1995 prohibits parents from choosing a name that \" might cause offense to a reasonable person; is unreasonably long; or is, includes, or resembles an official title or rank,\" including, apparently, Adolf Hitler and Yeah Detroit--both names recently rejected.\nDenmark If Danish parents prefer a moniker not on the list of 7,000 preapproved baby names, they must get permission from local church and government officials. Fifteen to 20 percent of the 1,100 reviewed names--including creative spellings of common names, last names as first names, and unusual names--are rejected each year.",
