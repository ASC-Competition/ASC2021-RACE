  "article": "One day when I left a bookstore and walked on the street, I saw a woman standing outside the post office. She looked pale and worried. I stopped and asked if she needed help. She told me that her foot was hurting and she had to go to the hospital fight away, but there was no taxi. I wanted to make a trip to a food store later that day. I asked the woman where she was going. She told me the name of a hospital which was actually on the way to the food store. So I said, My car is parked nearby, How about my giving you a ride? It will save you some time and money. She agreed gratefully.\nWhen we got to the hospital, she thanked me again and again. Then I went to the food store and picked up what I went for. As I was waiting at the checkout, the man behind me said that he had a coupon  for 20% off anything in the store. He gave it to me because he had an extra one and he wanted to do good things to others! I thanked him and let him go ahead  of me in line to check out.\nEach action creates a ripple   that finally comes back to us. Do you believe it?",
