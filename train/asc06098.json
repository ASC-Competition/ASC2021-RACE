Then head north.Will Steger is going to take all of us there.\nSteger,64, the first person to make a dogsled trip to the Noah Pole,is a very famous and admired polar explorer.He's at home in frozen parts of the world where few humans ever step on.Steger is also a devoted environmentalist who was early to ring the alarm bell on global warming.He saw its effects firsthand in frequent polar expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctica.\nSteger is about to lead a team of six young adventurers on a 1,400-mile,60-day-long dogsled trip across Ellesmere Island, in the Canadian Arctic.The sea ice in that region should still be frozen.\"We want to take our audience to the front lines of global warming,\"says Steger. The team will be uploading videos,stories and photos to the website global-warming 101.com as they march along,allowing armchair adventurers and kids in classrooms to follow their progress day to day.\"We can actually bring the audience up there,\"Steger says.\nStege's team will include some already-famous young explorers.Sam Branson, the22-year-old son of British airline tycoon Richard Branson,is an experienced Arctic traveler.Also on the journey will be 27-year-old Norwegian Sigrid Ekran.Last year,Ekran became only the second woman in history to win Rookie of the Year for the Iditarod Sled Dog Race.\nWhat they will see may be surprising.Even Steger doesn't know exactly what to expect.Climate change has already reshaped the geography of the Arctic.\"Within a decade or less, it's going to be impossible to reach the North Pole by dog team,without flotation ,\"says Steger.\nClimate change is happening,but people can change too.Their willingness to change will determine the shape of Earth's future.",
