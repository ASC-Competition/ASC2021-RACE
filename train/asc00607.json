  "article": "David is an excellent student and he comes from New York. His family was there until he finished eighth grade. David had no choice but to sleep on park benches. Being alone on the streets was scary. One thing kept David going: his determination to do well in school.\nEven though many things were difficult in David's life, one thing was going very well. David was accepted to a special high school called MC2STEM.It is a public school in Cleveland for kids who are extremely good at science. The school turned out a peaceful place for David. He especially enjoyed having the chance to learn by doing lots of projects.\nHigh school wasn't easy. But David says that the school helped him set high standards for himself. Even when he didn't have a place to stay at night, David kept his focus on his schoolwork.\nWhile he was homeless, David would sometimes sleep in the park during the day because it was safer. \" If you sleep in the daytime in the park, people won't bother you,\" he says. \"you're just taking a nap. It's acceptable.\" Then David would study through the night. He showered at a friend's house when his friend's parents were at work.\nAll his hard work paid off. In May 2011, David graduated second in his high school class. He was accepted to 22 colleges. He also won a scholarship form the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It will pay for all his college expenses.\nLast fall, David began attending Harvard University, one of the top colleges in the US.\"I found the perfect school for me.\" He wrote in his blog.\nIn the future, David might look for a job at a company like Google. Even better, he would like to start his own company. David says, \" I want to work for myself.\"",
