  "article": "Celebrating her first day as an adult on July, 12,2015, 18-year-old Nobel Peace Prize- winner Malala Yousafzai did the gift- giving---a girls' school for Syrian refugees( ) in Lebanon.\n\" I call on leaders of all the countries all around the world that we must invest in books instead of bullets,\" Malala Yousafzai said in a speech \" on behalf of the world's children.\" She made it an international conference. When she was 15 in the year 2012, Malala yousafzai was shot on school bus on her way home after school and seriously wounded by some gunmen of the Pakistani Taliban for advocating girls' education. After recovering ,she continued her advocacy, which led last year to her becoming the youngest Nobel winner ever.\nMalala told Reuters that she chose to open the school in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley \" because I believe that the voices of the Syrian refugees need to be heard, and they have been ignored for so long. We must help them to get education. It is my responsibility to set up some schools for children there.\"\nMore than a quarter of the estimated 4 million on Syrians who have fled the country's civil war are gathering in Lebanon, including about 500,000 school-age children. They have no opportunities to go to school.\nMalala Yousafzai set up Malala Fund shortly after she won the Nobel Peace Prize. Since then she has done a lot of work to raise money for the education of poor children all around the world. The school, near the Syrian border, can hold up to 200 girls aged14 to 18. The school was paid for by Yousafzai's non-profit Malala Fund. On that day, all the students in the school shared the birthday cake and sang songs, bringing the Nobel winner to tears.",
