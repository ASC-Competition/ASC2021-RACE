  "article": "Father's Day is the third Sunday in June. It is a day to thank fathers. On that day, fathers usually receive greeting gifts and cards. On the cards, children will write, \"Thanks, father.\" \"Best wishes for Father's Day\" and so on. Father's Day is also a day families get together at home as well as in the restaurants.\nWhere does the idea for the holiday come from? We should thank an American. In 1909 she wrote letters to some important persons. In her letter she advised to make Father's Day on the third Sunday in June. In June in 1910, people celebrated the first Father's Day in Washington. People whose parents are dead often decorated   their parents' graves   with flowers on these days. These are days of family fun and creating good feelings and memories.",
