  "article": "\"Beating is a sign of affection,cursing   is a sign of love.\"\nMany may not expect to hear the words of the old Chinese saying in these modern times--with parents wealthier and better educated than they have ever been--but experts say they still ring true.\nToday,it seems,Chinese parents are more likely to send their children to precollege military academies in the United States in the hope that some tough love will pave the way to success.\n\"Good education doesn't mean letting your children enjoy privileges,especially our boys.\" said Song Wenming,an entrepreneur   in Jinhua,East China's Zhejiang province. \"They should be raised in tough conditions to know what to fight for in the future.\"\nIn August,Song sent his 17yearold son to Valley Forge Military Academy (VFMA) in Pennsylvania. And _ ,even though it takes a lot of money--around $48,000 per year--to send a child to a strict military school.\nStatistics show that an increasing number of Chinese students have been registering with such academies.\nA few years ago,there were no Chinese students at Valley Forge. Today,there are 28. \"All of the Chinese students at Valley Forge came from wealthy families;some of them were spoiled.\" said Jennifer Myers,director of marketing and communications at the school.\nSong's only son,Song Siyu,had a rocky start during his first six weeks at the school. The teenager said he went to the school voluntarily but did not expect it to be as difficult.\nNow,three months later,he has perfected the art of taking a bath in 35 seconds,finishing a meal without looking at his food,and making his bed with precision. He can even take criticism,no matter how unreasonable.\n\"The training is hard but I know it is good for selfdevelopment of individuals.\" said Song Siyu. \"The endless training and scolding are just ways to build up our character;they are not personal.\"\nBut his enthusiasm is not universal. Ten of the 13 Chinese students who joined the academy this year have transferred to other schools.\nBut for those who stick with it,there is a reward for all the hard work.",
