  "article": "Liverpool is famed for many things -- most especially The Beatles and its football team. But few would associate the city with one of the most famous political speeches in history. Yet tourism officials in the city have published the claim that Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" was written at a city centre hotel. The allegation   has been made in a guide to a major art event named Liverpool Discovers.\nA map in the guide shows more than 20 locations where famous people were born along with places associated with celebrities   and events in their life. The guide claims, \"Martin Luther King visited his supporters in Liverpool three times, and the first draft of his famous speech 'I Have a Dream' is claimed to have been written at Adelphi Hotel.\" The speech, delivered to civil rights campaigners on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington in 1963, is one of the most quoted texts in history and was a definitive moment in the American Civil Rights Movement and in the fight for racial equality.\nDr. King's biographer, Godfrey Hodgson, said that the suggestion did not fit the facts. He said, \"I don't believe it. If he had been to Liverpool, there would have been massive media reports, as he would have been a big figure by then. Dr. King did visit the UK on a number of occasions but he was not in the UK around the time of this famous speech in 1963.\"Prof. John Belcham, a history lecturer of University of Liverpool who wrote an 800year history of Liverpool in 2008, confirmed that he was unaware of any connection between Dr. King and the city.",
