  "article": "Odland remembers like it was yesterday working in an expensive French restaurant in Denver. The ice cream he was serving fell onto the white dress of a rich and important woman.\nThirty years have passed, but Odland can not get the memory out of his mind, nor the woman's kind reaction . She was shocked, regained calmness and, in a kind voice, told the young Odland. \"It is OK. It wasn't your fault.\" When she left the restaurant, she also left the future Fortune 500 CEO  with a life lesson: You can tell a lot about a person by the way he or she treats the waiter.\nOdland isn't the only CEO to have made this discovery. Instead, it seems to be one of those few laws of the land that every CEO learns on the way up. It's hard to get a dozen CEO's to agree about anything, but most agree with the Waiter Rule. They say how others treat the CEO says nothing. But how others treat the waiter is like a window into the soul.\nWatch out for anyone who pulls out the power card to say something like, \"I could buy this place and fire you,\" or \"I know the owner and I could have you fired.\" Those who say such things have shown more about their character  than about their wealth and power.\nThe CEO who came up with it, or at least first wrote it down, is Raytheon CEO Bill Swanson. He wrote a best-selling book called Swanson's Unwritten Rules of Management. \"A person who is nice to you but rude to the waiter, or to others, is not a nice person,\" Swanson says. \"I will never offer a job to the person who is sweet to the boss but turns _ o someone cleaning the tables.\"",
