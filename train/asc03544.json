  "article": "Smith entered Mr.Watson's office.The boss was a hard man.He fired people who didn't do well without giving them a second chance.\n\"Smith,\" said Mr.Watson,\"this past year your department hasn't earned money.We're going to drop that department.It's finished.I'm sorry,--but you'll have to go.\" \"But,sir--if I just had a little more time.For the moment I need the job to keep my son at Riverside School.\"\n\"What's that!\" said the boss.\"Riverside!I didn't know you had a boy there.That's an expensive school for a man with your salary.\"\n\"I know,sir.But he likes it there so much!He's a star athlete and the best boxer in the school.The boys call him Champ  there.\"\nThe boss sat perfectly still for a long time--a faraway   look in his eyes.Then,suddenly,he said,\"We've got to close your department,Smith. But you'll take over a new job in another department.It means longer hours--maybe more pay.Now get out.You're here for life.\"\nSmith got out,with surprise on his face.Then the boss took a letter from the top drawer of his desk.It was Herbie's last letter from Riverside School--written a few days before he died.He had read it over and over again with sick pain.The letter read:\nI can't say the boys here are any nicer to me than the others were.I guess it's the same everywhere when you're a cripple  .But don't worry about me,Dad.They've got a good chemistry department here.And there's one boy here who is really great.He's a track star and boxing champ and just tops in chemistry.The boys call him Champ.He made them stop throwing my books around.And he knocked a boy down who hit me.He is the best friend I ever had.Dad,when I grow up,I want to do something for Champ.Something big--that he won't even know about.",
