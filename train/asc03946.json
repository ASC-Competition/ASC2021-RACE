  "article": "In eighth grade, I decided to try out for my school musical. I only made it through the first verse  before the drama teacher stopped me. It goes without saying that my Christmas song didn't get me any role.\nAm I embarrassed? NO. Not just because it was ten years ago, but also because it's such a great story to share. Why? I think the main reason is that admitting mistakes makes you easier to relate to. Interestingly enough, science confirms _ .\nResearchers have conducted many studies and have concluded that when someone makes a mistake or acts in a clumsy way, they are found to be more likeable. In other words, if you're able to do well and then you mess up, it shows your human side. This allows others to connect and relate to you, which in turn makes them like you more.\nGrowing up, I was type of student who had to get straight A's and the type of athlete who always had to perform at the top of the game. The problem was that my standards were so ridiculously high that I was never happy. It was only when I learned to let go and forgive myself for my mistakes that I truly felt relaxed.\nWhen one of your close friends or family members makes a mistake, are you quick to forgive and forget? Sadly, many of us often express more sympathy for others than ourselves. With each mistake coming a lesson, you will be better equipped to handle life's challenges going forward.\nMore importantly, if you are always worried about looking silly, you will never be able to get improved. Even if you make a fool of yourself, it isn't the end of the world. Think about it: What's the worst that can happen? In many cases, the reward often outweighs the risk.",
