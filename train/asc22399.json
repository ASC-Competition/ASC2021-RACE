  "article": "One Sunday evening, it was quite dark when old Stanley went for his walk. He was walking along the sidewalk, Suddenly, he saw a white car coming around the corner at high speed. It was going too fast and crashed into a red car in the street where he was walking. He rushed up to the cars to see if anyone was hurt and needed help.\nThe two drivers were arguing.\n\"You came around the corner too fast,\" one man said.\n\"No!\" said the driver of the white car, \"That's not true! Your car was parked in a wrong place.\"\nStanley listened to their argument and then said the white car driver was wrong to drive too fast. The driver of red car asked Stanley to prove he was right in court . Stanley gave the driver his name and telephone number.\nNext Thursday morning, Stanley was asked to go to the court. The lawyer  for the driver of the white car asked him a lot of questions about what he had seen. Then he asked Stanley how old he was.\n\"I'm eighty-two,\" answered Stanley.\n\"Do you usually wear glasses ?\" asked the lawyer.\n\"Yes, I do,\" answered Stanley.\n\"Were you wearing them on the night of the accident?\" the lawyer asked.\n\"No,\" replied Stanley.\nThen the lawyer said, \"Why should the court believe you? You are eighty-two years old, you were not wearing your glasses, and it was dark. How far can you see in the dark?\"\nStanley thought about it for a minute. \"Well,\" he said, \"when it's dark, I can see the moon. How far is that?\"",
