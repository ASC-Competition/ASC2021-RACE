So what's wrong with you and Lisa?\"asked Tina,\"I thought you were friends.\"\"Yes, so did I,\" said Eve.\"But she hasn't spoken to me for two weeks now.She promised to help me review for the physics exam too, but then she's ignored all my calls and texts.\"\nWhile in the exam, Eve found Lisa was holding her phone on her knee under the table and reading from it.Eve couldn't believe it! Is that how Lisa always got such good grades? She thought about telling the teacher, but she hesitated.The next exam was history.That was Eve's favorite subject but she couldn't concentrate.She didn't know what to do about Lisa.Just then, Mr.Reed, their teacher, walked past.\"Mr.Reed...\"\nLisa was called to the teachers' office and there waited Mr.Reed...\nThe history test was over.Eve was walking towards the school gate when she heard footsteps behind her.It was Lisa.Eve could see that she had been crying.\"Listen,\" said Lisa.\"I'm really sorry I haven't answered your calls, but my dad had a heart attack two weeks ago and he's in hospital.He had a big heart operation today and I was very worried about him.So I was reading texts from my mum, but Mr.Reed caught me.He thought I was cheating.He believes me now, but I have to take the exam again.I'm sorry I didn't tell you what was happening.Will you forgive me?\"",
