  "article": "Dear David,\nHow are you ? I'm fine. I'm in London, at the International School of English. I'm in Class 3 with eight students . They are from different countries---Spain, Japan, Argentina, Switzerland and Thailand. Our teacher's name is Henry . He's very nice. He's a very good teacher.\nI'm living with an English family. Mr and Mrs Brown have three children. Thomas is fourteen, Catharine is twelve, and Andrew is seven. They are all very friendly, but it isn't easy to understand them !\nLondon is very big and very interesting. The weather is cold but sunny and the parks are beautiful! Hyde Park , Green Park and ST.Jame's Park are all in the city centre .\nEnglish food is OK, but the coffee is horrible!\nWrite to me soon .\nLove,\nPaula",
