  "article": "Sitting by her Pinocchio lamp, she smiled at me as her tiny hands' shadow danced on the bedroom wall.\"A rabbit!\" she laughed with all the delight of a four-year old.Her blue eyes shone with pride as she showed me the animated image she had created.\"Daddy, will you show me how to make a tiger?\" she asked.\"Sure,\" I said, \"and then we'll read a story and tell your angels goodnight.\"To my youngest daughter, that meant her bedtime prayer.\nToday my daughter is seven, and I no longer get to read the story.She reads it to me, complete with expressive accents for the story characters.\nTo say I'm proud of our relationship would be an understatement.We have shared days of joy as well as tragedy.Our time together has strengthened the relationship of love and special \" _ \" that is all our own.\nI am richer for having planted the spirit of trust in this gentle little person; we have grown together spiritually, learning much from each other.The special times we spend together, like nights by a Pinocchio lamp, create memories that we will treasure for the rest of our lives.\nSo it is with all of our relationships.The trust factor is vital for relationships to develop.Think of one of your fondest memories, and you will no doubt find a remarkable relationship at its center--one with a spiritual quality that shines outward from the heart.\nTime together, caring acts, and unconditional love build trust.I suggest that we each spend plenty of time with our personal \"Pinoechio lamps\"--those special ways that we choose to strengthen our relationships.\nRelationships take time to develop and maintain.It is not always easy, but the results are priceless.\"Nights by a Pinoechio lamp\", wherever those might be for you, will create enduring relationships of golden \"life stuff\", spiritual gifts that no one can take away.",
