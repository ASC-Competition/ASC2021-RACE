  "article": "Can you make animals work for us? Some scientists think that one day we can teach animals to do a lot of things for people. In a film shown on TV, you may see elephants, monkeys, tigers or some other animals are always given a little food to eat after they have done something. Scientists say that people can teach many different animals to do some of the easy work if they know they will get something to eat. We all know elephants can carry large logs ,and dogs can look after houses. And we even teach animals to work in factories. In America, for example, people have used\nto help make cars and scientists think that those large monkeys may drive trains one day. Now people are trying to get them to do the same thing that man does.",
