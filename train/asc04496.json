  "article": "If teens could reduce the salt they take in every day by 3,000 milligrams (mg), they would cut their risk of heart disease and stroke  greatly in adulthood, researchers say.\nBased on the results of a computer modeling analysis, researchers found that a 3,000 mg reduction in sodium  by teenagers could reduce hypertension by 30 percent to 43 percent when they become adults.\nHypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition that may have no symptoms for years, but can eventually cause serious health conditions, including heart attack and stroke.\nOther benefits over time as teens hit 50 years of age include a 7-12 percent reduction in coronary heart disease , an 8-14 percent reduction in heart attacks, and a 5-8 percent reduction in stroke.\nFast food typically contains too much sodium. One bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos has 310 milligrams. Pizza is one of the biggest problems for teens when it comes to sodium, according to data from the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\"The additional benefit of lower salt intake early is that we can hopefully change the expectations of how food should taste, ideally to something slightly less salty,\" says Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, the lead author of the study and associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\"Most of the salt we eat is not from our salt shaker , but salt that is already added in food that we eat.\" she added.",
