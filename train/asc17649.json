  "article": "Coca-Cola has created a publicity stunt   in Singapore -- a vending machine   which gives out free cans of Coke in return for hugs. The _ idea is part of the company's Open Happiness campaign designed to attract young people in Singapore.\nStudents at the National University of Singapore were surprised to find that the soft drinks company had placed the machine in the schoolyard. But instead of the drinks brand's logo  , the words \"Hug Me\" are written across its red-and-white logo. Instead of paying money, customers have to hug the drinks machine to receive a free can of Coke.\nPublic displays of affection are uncommon and have long been discouraged in Singapore, but are on the rise among young people. The move is part of a campaign created by the advertising firm Ogilvy & Mather, intended to let the youth to see the brand as a non-threatening friend.\nLeonardo O'Grady, leader of the campaign, said, \"Happiness is contagious  . The Coca-Cola Hug Machine is a simple idea to spread some happiness. We want to spread happiness in an unexpected, creative way to attract not only the people present, but the audience at large.\"\nHe hopes that it will encourage consumers to bring positivity, optimism and fun into their lives and to open a Coke, sharing a little happiness.\nThe machines have been such a success that there are plans to roll them out across Asia. Mr. O'Grady added, \"The reaction was amazing -- at one point we had four to five people hugging the machine at the same time as well as each other! In fact, there was a long line of people looking to give hugs.\"",
