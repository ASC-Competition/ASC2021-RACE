  "article": "Comparative thinking and behavior is quite typical among teenagers,  but it is the responsibility of the parent to set limits and hold firmly to them. Frequently, a parent will tell me in frustration about how their child has complained about not having the very best in fashion design like their friends, or the latest electronic gadgetry that all the other kids own.\nParents need to teach their children selfconfidence. Those who are selfconfident resist the urge to compare themselves to other people, and do not overestimate others' experience while diminishing their own. But some people may have a mantra signified by the slogan, if only. \"If only I had the money of my brother; if only I was smart like my classmates; if only I was as goodlooking as my friends.\"\nComparing oneself with others is a trap. People who compare themselves with other individuals tend to feel that they are not good enough.  They tend to perseverate about their shortcomings. Even if they try their best,it is not good enough because they can always find someone who performs at a higher level. When people compare, they generally focus on their negative traits. They ignore all that is going right in their life. They also tend to minimize their success and dismiss positive gestures and compliments.\nThose who are confident listen to their own inner voice. They are not influenced by other people's view of events. They are not overly impressed by others' success, money, health,and material possessions. They do not believe that others have a greater sense of emotional wellbeing than they do.\nRecently,  The Harvard Mental Health Letter published an article which  indicated  that  people  with  chronic pain had as significant a sense of wellbeing as those without chronic pain. However, those with chronic pain tended to overestimate the emotional wellbeing of physically healthy people. The study confirmed that it is how we view events that is important, not the nature of our circumstances which may include making comparisons.",
