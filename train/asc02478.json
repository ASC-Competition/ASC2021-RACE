  "article": "You can love them or hate them, but no matter which tourist destination you visit, chances are you'll see someone with their head buried in a Lonely Planet guidebook.\nLonely Planet is one of the world's largest travel guide brands, publishing more than 500 different guides in eight languages.The popular brand also produces television shows, websites and podcasts   all devoted to travel.\nSome people praise Lonely Planet books because they make traveling easy and affordable.They also save time and make sure you don't miss the best things.\nThey also provide the reviews of hostels, hotels, restaurants and ticket information about your destination.\nThis can be great if you're a nervous traveler, or if you haven't traveled by yourself before.If you're in a country where you don't speak the language, sometimes there's nothing better than getting into a taxi and opening up a guidebook.You simply point to a map that directs the taxi driver to a hostel that's cheap and clean, with friendly staff and cold beer.\nBut others criticize Lonely Planet and other travel guide publishers like them.They say guidebooks take the fun and spontaneity   out of traveling, and that part of the enjoyment of travel comes from the fact that anything can happen.They also regret that if you follow a guidebook, you'll end up doing the same thing and having the same experience as everyone else.You might end up seeing the same group of people over and over, because everyone is reading the same book and following the same route.\nAnother criticism of travel guides is that they have a large impact on local communities.For example, some locals devote their lives to behaving in ways that attract tourists.They pretend to live a traditional lifestyle, wear traditional clothes and live in traditional houses in order to attract the tourist dollar.",
