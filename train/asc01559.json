The practical approach, coupled with a record number of students graduating from college, is expected to strengthen competition in the job market, analysts said.\nMore than 76 percent of university students said they wanted to work after earning their degrees this summer, up from 68.5 percent in 2012 and 73.6 percent last year, according to poll results from Zhaopin.com, a major online agency, Zhu Bo.\nThe annual survey also shows that about 20 percent university graduates chose to further education after graduation, while about 3 percent wanted to start their own businesses.\nZeng Hao ,a 25-year-old media major, managed to land a job in a publishing company in Zhongshan, Guangdong province, before he received his master's degree from the University of Macau in June. \" Work experience really matters in the publishing industry\" he said.\nWei Guihong , a program administrator at Nanjing University, said about 60 percent of the school's graduates entered the labor market every year. \"More and more students majoring in a foreign language choose to go abroad to continue their studies to improve their language skills,\" she said continuously, \"That's perhaps a bright future.\"\nLiu Junsheng , a researcher at the Labor and Wage Institute of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, believes that economic conditions play a vital role in shaping college graduates' choices .\"There were fewer job opportunities in the market. \" he said. \"Although academic degrees still matter, more and more employers value job seekers' work experience.\" he said.\nThe Zhaopin.com survey shows that each of the graduates sent resumes  on average to about 28 potential employers and received five interview opportunities.",
