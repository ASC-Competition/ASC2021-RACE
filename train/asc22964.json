He was a 79-year-old man. He noticed something was different about me and asked if anything was wrong. I told him what I was anxious   about and asked him: \"What was the best time of your life?\"\nWithout hesitation, Nicholas replied: \"Well, Joe, when I was a child in Austria and everything was taken care of for me, that was the best time of my life.\"\n\"When I was going to school and learning the things I know today, that was the best time of my life.\"\n\"When I got my first job and got paid for my work, that was the best time of my life.\"\n\"When I met my wife and fell in love, that was the best time of my life.\"\n\"World War IIcame, and my wife and I had to leave Austria to save our lives. When we were together and safe on a ship, that was the best time of my life.\"\n\"When I became a young father and watched my children grow up, that was the best time of my life.\"\n\"And now, Joe, I am 79 years old.
