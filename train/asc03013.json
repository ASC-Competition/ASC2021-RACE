  "article": "One of the Queen's closest relatives and oldest friends was allowed to give a deep description into the family life of the Royals. Although there have been hundreds of other books declaring to offer a quick look behind the Palace doors, this is the first written by someone who is closely related to the Royal Family and has shared their lives--not only throughout the Queen's reign   but also through that of her father, King George VI.\nThe Final Curtsey was written by her Majesty's cousin and childhood playmate the Honorable Margaret Rhodes. It tells in details the story of Mrs. Rhodes's relationship with the Royal family over eight decades. The book, with delightfully informal and never-before-seen pictures, has been written with the full knowledge of the Queen, who has read and approved parts of it.\nBorn in 1925, the Honorable Margaret Rhodes has led an extraordinary life. She was the childhood playmate of her cousin, the Queen; a wartime M16 spy; and she was a lady-in- waiting   to her aunt, the Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, from 1991 until the latter's death in 2002. At the Queen's 80thbirthday in April 2006, Margaret gave an interview to the BBC which she proved that, in her own opinion and despite several false reports, the Queen would not abdicate .\nIn this charming autobiography  ,she told how she was offered a house to live in the Royal farm in Windsor Great Park unexpectedly. One day when she and the Queen were out riding outside, she suddenly returned and said, \"Could you bear to live in the suburb?\" \"I think it should be OK.\" Therefore Mrs. Rhodes is now still living there.",
