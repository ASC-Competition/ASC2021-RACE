This can be the most important event of the year, except for graduation.Students plan it for many weeks in advance.\n   Several days before Homecoming,students begin to decorate  the school.There are signs to wish luck to the team and many other signs to welcome back the graduates from other years.Many people still come to Homecoming twenty or thirty years after they graduate.\nThe members of school clubs sell delicious foods and fruits,such as apples and sandwiches.Some clubs even help to welcome visitors.\nDuring the day people like to look for teachers that they remember from long ago.Often they see old friends and they talk together about those happy years in school.\n    Everyone soon comes to watch the football game. When the game is half over,the band comes onto the field and plays school songs.Another important moment is when the Homecoming Queen appears.All the students vote a most popular student Homecoming Queen or King.It is a great honor to be chosen as the Homecoming Queen or King.\n    Homecoming is a happy day, but it is not perfect unless the football wins the game.Even if the team loses,the students still enjoy Homecoming.Some stay at the school to dance,and others go to a party.For everyone it is a day to remember for a long,long time.",
