  "article": "There was once a boy in a village. Whenever he asked people to do things, no one would listen to him. He was sad. So he asked a wizard  to solve the problem by using magic. The old wizard tried a lot of spells , but it didn't work.\nA young man heard about the problem. He went to the boy and said that he knew the solution. He gave the boy two small pieces of paper.\n\"These are two spells, my boy. Use the first before you ask others to do something, and use the second when they have done it. A smile is also necessary, \"the young man said.\nThe boy was happy and tried to use the spells. When he asked people to do something, he said \"Please\" before his words and \"Thank you\"after they had done it. People were very surprised that the boy could be polite. Soon, they became happy to do what the boy asked them to do.\nThe wizard was surprised, and asked the young man about the spells.\n\"It's not magic. When I was a child, my teacher told me that with good _ you could get anything you want. And he was right. The boy only needed good manners to get what he wanted.\"",
