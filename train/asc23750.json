  "article": "What will the weather be like? Some people say they can know the weather from animals.\nSome people look at seabirds. When they see seabirds fly high out to sea, they say it will be a nice day. When the weather is bad, the seabirds will stay on the shore  . They don't like to fly and they sit in trees when rain is on the way.\nOther people look at different animals on a farm. Chickens make a big noise   and run here and there when rain is on the way. Frogs   can tell the weather, too. When rain is coming, they stay in water and make a lot of noise. But on a nice day they are quiet and will jump out of water.",
