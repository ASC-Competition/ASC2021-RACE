  "article": "Even before they start school, many young girls worry that they are fat. But a new study suggests watching a movie starring astereotypically thin and beautiful princess may not increase children's anxieties.\nNearly half of the 3 to 6 year old girls in a study by Professor Stacey Tantleff-Dunn and doctoral student Sharon Hayes said they worry about being fat. About one-third would change a physical feature, such as their weight or hair color.\nThe number of girls worried about being fat at such a young age concerns Tantleff-Dunn because of the potential effects later in life. Studies have shown young girls worried about their body image are more likely to suffer from eating disorders when they are older.\nThe encouraging news for parents is that taking their young daughters to see the new Disney film \"The Princess and the Frog\" isn't likely to influence how they see their bodies.\n\"The media have a great effect on how young girls see their bodies. That's why it's important for parents to use movies such as 'The Princess and the Frog,' to start conversations with their children about weight, skin color and their views of beauty. They can explain that princesses' tiny waists are not realistic for girls and that children don't need Cinderella's golden hair or Snow White'sporcelain  skin to look good,\" Tantleff-Dunn said.\n\"We need to help our children challenge the images of beauty, particularly thinness, that they see and idolize, and encourage them to question how much appearance should be part of their self-worth,\" said Tantleff-Dunn. \"We should help them build a positive self-image with an appreciation for many different types of body features.\" And as their children's most important role models, parents also should avoid criticizing their own bodies.",
