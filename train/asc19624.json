  "article": "Do you remember when your grandma told you the story of Snow White? Ah, the happy days of childhood!\nBut did you know that Snow White comes from Germany? It's just one story from the 209 in Grimm's Fairy Tales (<<>>  ). The Grimm brothers started to collect fairy tales in 1806. Their first book came out   in 1812. Why are German fairy tales so interesting? Maybe it's because they come from a great place famous for its stories - the Black Forest. The Black Forest is in southwest Germany. It's the largest forest in the country - and one of the most beautiful. It's famous for its trees and lovely views, There are valleys and waterfalls  there. It's a good place to start a story.\nDon't forget to bring something back if you visit. People there are good at making clocks, musical instruments and watches.",
