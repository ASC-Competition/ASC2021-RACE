  "article": "In the mid 1990s, people started doing business on the Internet. At that time, there were two kinds of companies. First, there were traditional companies which sold things in stores. Then, there were Internet companies which didn't have stores, they sold things only over the Net.\nTraditional companies didn't want to lose any business. Quickly, they created their own websites and began selling things over the Net. These are the so-called \"brick and click\" companies. Many stores are made of brick, and you click on your mouse to buy things with your computer. That's where the name \"brick and click\" comes from.\nBy the late 1990s, e-businesses like Amazon.com, Buy.com, and eToys.com were in trouble. Their profits  were not very high, and there was a lot of competition. Many of these businesses lost a lot of money, and in 2000, many e-businesses were out of business.\nIn the world of e-commerce , companies are fighting for every dollar and every customer. Will brick and click companies win the war? Only time will tell.",
