  "article": "Once upon a time, there was an island inhabited by: Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all the rest of it, including Love. One day it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.\nLove was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.\nWhen the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.\nRichness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, \"Richness, can you take me with you?\"\nRichness answered, \"No, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.\"\nLove decided to ask Vanity  who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. \"Vanity, please help me!\"\n\"I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,\" Vanity answered.\nSadness was close by so Love asked, \"Sadness, let me go with you.\"\n\"Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!\"\nHappiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her.\nSuddenly, there was a voice, \"Come, Love, I will take you.\" It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way.",
