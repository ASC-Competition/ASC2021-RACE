He is very glad and he runs to his father. \"Dad, please don't wait for me after school next time. I can go home by myself . I have grown up.\" says Wang Bing.\n\"Let's go,\" says the father, \"I'll cook supper and you can do your homework at home: Mum is still at work.\"On their way home, Wang Bing sees some boys skating in a park. \"Can I go and learn skating. Dad?\" asks Wang Bing. \"I'm sorry, my boy. You must go home and do your homework,\" answers his father, \"but I can buy you an ice-cream.\" Then his father buys an ice-cream for him. When Wang Bing wants to eat it, a fly  flies to the ice-cream.\n\"Drive off  the fly,' says his father, \"it's very dirty  .\"But Wang Bing says with a smile. \"You don't let me skate, but can you let him skate for a while ?\"",
