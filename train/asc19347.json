However, sometimes some of them might be able to show us the love that we have forgotten on our \"busy road\", just like the following story.\nA dog, was knocked down by a car and died in the middle of the road. Later, another dog ran beside the body of the dead dog and he tried to wake his friend up using his legs. When his effort to wake up his friend failed, he tried to push his friend to the roadside. But his friend was too heavy for him to push.\nThough traffic was busy and dangerous, he wouldn't want to go away from his friend, just standing beside his friend shouting and crying.\nA lot of people saw this story and were very touched  . Even a dog can show his loyalty   and love to his friend, what can our humans do?",
