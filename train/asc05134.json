  "article": "Mr and Mrs Smith had always spent their summer holidays in New Jersey in the past, staying in a small inn  at the foot of a hill. One year, however, Mr. Smith made a lot of money in his business, so they decided to go to London and stay at a really good hotel while they went touring around that famous city.\nThey flew to London and arrived at their hotel late one evening. They expected that they would have to go to bed hungry, because in that small inn in New Jersey, no meals were served after seven. They were therefore surprised when the man who received them in the hall asked whether they would take dinner there that night.\n\"Are you still serving dinner?\" asked Mr Smith.\n\"Yes, certainly, sir,\" answered the man. \"We serve it until half past nine.\"\n\"What are the times of meals then?\" asked Mr Smith.\n\"Well, sir,\" answered the man, \"We serve breakfast from seven to half past eleven in the morning, lunch from twelve to three in the afternoon, tea from four to five, and dinner from six to half past nine.\"\n\"But that hardly leaves any time for us to see the sights of London!\" said Mrs Smith.",
