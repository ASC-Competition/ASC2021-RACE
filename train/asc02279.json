  "article": "THANK-you cards--heartfelt expressions of gratitude for gifts, services and general kindness--seem to be rare in an age when the Internet continues to reduce human interaction.\nAlthough our society has changed greatly over the past century, the _ of thank-you notes has not.\nWhile most people would agree that thank-you notes under these circumstances are a necessity, there are still those who forever postpone or are forgetful for unknown reasons.\nAnd at no time of the year are thank-you notes more visible (or lacking) than June, the month of graduations, and the beginning of summer parties.\n\"It's a must-do thing. A real thank you does not come by e-mail.  It comes in the mail in an envelope. And what comes out of an envelope is a beautiful thing to touch and to handle and to pass around for everyone to read,\" said etiquette expert Letitia Baldrige.\nDon't think for a second that Baldrige is old-fashioned. Handwritten thank-you notes--any handwritten correspondence, for that matter- have taken on an air of extra importance and dignity   in this e-hyper   world.\nBaldrige remains hopeful that the art may be enjoying a renaissance (,).\nMore than simply obeying rules of etiquette, thank-you cards are a sign of caring.\n\"They're more important now than ever,\" expert Peter Post says. \"You are building a relationship. And part of building that relationship is that you acknowledge when someone has done something nice for you. \"\n\"The payoff,\" Post says, \"can be huge. The more we do it, the more it comes back to us, and it's a benefit to us all. It makes our world a little bit nicer place to live in. \"",
