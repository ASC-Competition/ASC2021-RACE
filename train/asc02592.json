  "article": "Do you like somewhere a little bit different to the usual types of places you find on the high street? I do,so I'm glad to see new ones popping up everywhere in London.\nThe so called pop-up shop is a temporary arrangement.In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008,many businesses had to shut down.Shops,warehouses and offices were left vacant when they stopped trading.Pop-up enterprisers occupied some of them quickly. For them the appeal of this temporary shopping concept is clear:they can start a business with much 1ower risk.The temporary nature of a pop-up shop gives the opportunity to test a product and develop a customer base,without being tied in to a long-term renting contract. Being small makes it much easier for pop-ups to expand if they are successful*\nPop-up shops first appeared in the UK in the early 2000s,with the economy booming. They were originally a way for small companies to rent retail space in great locations. This was while landlords who owned these spaces looked for permanent renters.\nPop-up shops can take a number of different forms.They might be temporary shops in the high street or a shopping centre.They might be simple market stalls . They could be based in some kind of transport,like a food truck.Or they could be run by people who visit different establishments,like travelling chefs who take over pub and restaurant kitchens temporarily.\nAccording to a report by the Centre of Economic and Business Research,the pop-up industry was worthPS2.1bn and is expected to grow by 8.4%this year.Almost anything that can be on a high street can also be a pop-up.There have been pop-up shops,art galleries,theatres and restaurants among others.In an age of fast-changing habits,the pop-up idea might be here to stay.",
