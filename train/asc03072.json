  "article": "What are you feeling right now as you start to read this? Are you curious? Hoping that you'll learn something about yourself? Bored because this is something you have to do for school and you're not really into it -- or happy because it's a school project you enjoy? Perhaps you're attracted by something else, like feeling excited about your weekend plans or sad because you just went through a breakup.\nEmotions like these are part of human nature. They give us information about what we're experiencing and help us know how to react. We sense our emotions from the time we're babies. Young children react to their emotions with facial expressions or with actions like laughing or crying. They feel and show emotions, but they don't yet have the ability to name the emotion or say why they feel that way.\nAs we grow up, we become more skilled in understanding emotions. Instead of just reacting like little kids do, we can identify  what we feel and put it into words. With time and practice, we get better at knowing what we are feeling and why. This skill is called emotional awareness.\nEmotional awareness helps us know what we need and want, or don't want! It helps us build better relationships. That's because being aware of our emotions can help us talk about feelings more clearly, avoid or settle conflicts  better, and move past difficult feelings more easily.\nSome people are naturally more in touch with their emotions than others. The good news is that everyone can be more aware of their emotions. It just takes practice. But it's worth the effort.\nEmotional awareness is the first step toward building emotional intelligence, a skill that can help people succeed in life.",
