  "article": "I was born into a family of five children. As the youngest child, I didn't have many new clothes. Though my parents worked very hard, we could hardly make ends meet. The only time we would receive new clothes was at Christmas.\nThe family across the street lived a much better life. They just had two daughters and they were often seen wearing new dresses. The younger girl named Anna was of my age. One afternoon, she walked on the street wearing a beautiful white dress. She looked like an angel in that dress. I, together with many little girls, followed her. We just couldn't keep our eyes off her dress. We all wished we would have such a dress one day!\nThat day, after coming back, I told my mom that I wanted a dress like that. My mom frowned  she thought such a beautiful dress like that must cost an arm and a leg, but my mom kept that in mind. She worked five days a week at that time, but when Christmas was getting close, she worked even on every Saturday.\nHowever, several days before Christmas, I changed my mind. It was Anna's birthday that day and I was invited to her home with some other girls. After that party, I asked if I could try on her white dress. \"Of course,\" she said, \"and you can take it if you like it.\" I couldn't believe my ears. How could she give such a beautiful dress to someone else? After trying it on, I knew why.\nThe dress looked beautiful, but it was uncomfortable to wear. As a matter of fact, my back was quite itchy  after I put it on. From that day on, I stopped admiring what others had. They may not be as good aswe think.",
