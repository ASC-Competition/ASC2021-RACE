  "article": "Scientists are not sure how the brain follows the tracks of time.One theory holds that it has a group of cells specialized to record the intervals  of time, while another theory holds that some neural processes  act as an inside clock.\nWhichever theory it may be, studies find, the cells have a poor grasp of longer interval.Time does seem to slow during an empty afternoon and race when the brain focuses on challenging work.Stimulants  , including caffeine, tend to make people feel as if.time is passing faster; complex jobs, like doing taxes, can seem to drag on longer than they actually do.And  emotional  events -- a breakup, a promotion, a transformative trip abroad --tend to be sensed as more recent than they actually are, by months or even years.In short, some psychologists say, the findings support the philosopher Martin Heidegger' s observation that time \"persists merely as a consequence of the events taking place in it.\"\nNow researchers are finding that the opposite thing may also be true: if very few events come to mind, then the sense of time does not persist; the brain shortens the interval that has passed.\nIn one classic experiment, a French explorer named Michel Siffre lived in a cave for two months, cut off from the rhythms of night and day and man-made clocks.He appeared then, convinced that he had been isolated for only 25 days.Left to its own devices, the brain tends to shorten time.\nIn earlier work, researchers found  that a similar case at work in people's judgment of intervals that last only moments.Relatively infrequent stimuli, like flashes or tones, tend to increase the speed of the brain' s internal pacemaker.\nOn an obvious level, these kinds of findings offer an explanation for why other people' s children seem to grow up so much faster than one's own.Involved parents are all too well aware of first step in their own children; however, seeing a cousin's child once every few years, without bothering memories, shortens the time.",
