As she once said to herself,\"I would never sit back in a rocking chair, waiting for someone to help me.\"\n   She was born on a farm in New York State. At twelve she left home and was in a service until at twenty-seven, she married Thomas Moses, the tenant of hers. They farmed most of their lives. She had ten children, of whom five survived . Her husband died in 1927.\n     Grandma Moses painted a little as a child and made embroidery  pictures as a hobby. As she became old, she wanted to keep busy and pass the time, so she began to paint again. Her pictures were first sold at the local drugstore and at a market and were soon noticed by a businessman who bought everything she painted. Between the 1930's and her death she produced some 2,000 pictures:careful and lively pictures of the country life she had known, with a wonderful sense of color1 and form.",
