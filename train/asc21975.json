  "article": "This Thursday, across the USA, kids are skipping school  and going to work with their parents. They'll be making copies, sending faxes  and sweeping floors. This is because April 28 is Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work Day all over the USA. This holiday shows kids what it means to be a grown-up in the working world.\nI still remember when this day started, I was very happy. Not only did I have the chance to miss school, but I also got to sit in my dad's taxi all day long and we would go to a restaurant for lunch.\nBut after only 20 minutes of driving around the city, I was very bored. couldn't read my book in the car as I would get carsick  and my dad didn't like to turn on the radio. I got hot and uncomfortable. People wouldn't get into his taxi because they thought he already had a passenger-me, so nothing happened. It seemed years before we went out for lunch. I actually started to miss school.\nWhile the point of the day is to give kids a chance to experience real-life jobs and give them an idea of the possibilities   for their futures, I got something completely different from the day. I learned to appreciate   school. Where else do you get to play with your friends, do science experiments, read great books and write stories all in one day?\nJust as you'll have to learn to love your job later in life, learn to love school now. If you don't already, try spending the day at work with your dad.",
