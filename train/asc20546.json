  "article": "Cinderella\nOnce upon a time, there lived an unhappy young girl. She was unhappy, for her mother died several years ago, and her father married   another woman. The woman had two daughters. They were her stepsisters (/)now. Her new mother didn't like her. All the nice dresses, shoes, delicious food, kind thoughts and care were for her own daughters.\nFor the poor unhappy girl, there was nothing at all. No dresses, only her stepsisters' hand-me-downs . No lovely dishes and no nice rests. For she had to work hard all day, and only when evening came, she could sit for a while by the fire, near the cinders (,). That is how she got her nickname-Cinderella.",
