  "article": "Knowing about yourself not only means finding out what you're good at and what you like, but also means discovering what you're not good at and what you don't like. Both help you to see your aim  in life.\nAlthough most students would be unhappy if they failed a very difficult physics examination, they have in fact learned a lot about themselves. They know that they should not become engineers or physical scientists. So failing can help a student to live a happier life if he learns something from it. They may then decide on their aims and choose the work they like and are fit for.\nIt is impossible to decide whether you like something until you have tried it. If you decide to play the piano, you need to take more than one lesson before knowing whether you are really interested in it or able to do well. It is not enough if you want to be a great pianist. You also have to like the hard practice and long training. If you enjoy being a great pianist but hate the work, forget it.\nIt's a good plan to try as many ideas as possible when you are young. Then you will find out what your true interests are.",
