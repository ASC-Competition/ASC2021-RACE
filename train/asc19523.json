  "article": "Helen's eyes are not very good, so she wears glasses. But she doesn't wear glasses when she is with her friend, Jim. When Jim comes to her house to take her out, she will take her glasses off, and when she gets back, she puts on the glasses.\nOne day her mother asks her, \"Helen, why don't you wear glasses when you are with Jim? He takes you to many lovely places in his car, but you can't see anything. \" Helen says, \"I look more lovely to Jim when I'm not wearing my glasses and he looks better to me, too. \"",
