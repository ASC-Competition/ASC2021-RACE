  "article": "Slang is a popular, less official and often very current form of language. It is an important part of a living language and is constantly changing as language changes. Slang is often playful, direct and sometimes less respectful than the more official and traditional version of language. So now I'm going to lay it on you! To \"lay it on\" is American slang for \"to tell\" or \"to explain.\"\nSlang can take many forms. For example, slang can be local to one city or area. In Washington, D.C. there is a whole set of slang to describe politics and business in the city. For example, the term POTUS stands for President of the United States. POTUS can often be found with his wife, FLOTUS, the first lady of the United States. \"Inside the Beltway\" is a popular expression that describes the area of Washington, D.C. The beltway is the large highway that circles the city.\nThe Internet has helped create a whole new kind of computer-related slang. An \"angry fruit salad\" is an expression that describes a website with too many bright colors. \"Netiquette\" is slang for correct behavior when using the Internet.\nYoung people often develop the latest slang. For example, to say Special English \"rocks\" or is \"phat\" means Special English is really great. A \"kegger\" is a party where beer is served.  If something is \"wack\", it is wild and crazy.\nDifferent professions often have their own slang as well. For example, medical workers might refer to a complaining patient as a \"gomer\".  A \"tough stick\" is someone whose veins are difficult to find when he or she needs to have blood taken.\nNo matter how well you speak English, there are always new and interesting slang words to discover. There are entire dictionaries for describing slang. Many experts do not even agree on what is and what is not slang. Often slang words later become a part of officially accepted language. Official or not, slang is an energetic and exciting part of the American language that continues to change.",
