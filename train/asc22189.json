But sometimes these stories have happy endings, too.\nA family in New Jersey, US, had a cat named Vivian. She was very smart. She could even draw with her wet paws  on the floor. They all loved her very much. When hurricane   Sandy hit America in October, they moved to a safer place 13km away from home. Unluckily, Vivian was missing  . All the nine family members were worried about her. They put up posters   to find her. They looked for her everywhere they thought she could stay, but they didn't find it.
