  "article": "Nonverbal  Communication\nWhen you are in another country, it is important to know the language, but it is equally important to know how to communicate nonverbally. Before saying anything, people communicate nonverbally by making gestures. According to an investigation ,only 30 to 35 percent of our communication is verbal. When people don't know the language, the most common way to communicate is through gestures. However, many gestures have different meanings, or no meaning at all, in different parts of the world.\nIn the United States, for example, nodding your head up and down means \"yes\". In some parts of Greece and Turkey, however, this motion can mean \"no\". In Southeast Asia, nodding your head is a polite way of saying \"I've heard you.\"\nIn ancient Rome, when the emperor wanted to spare someone's life, he would put his thumb up. Today in the United States, when someone puts his/her thumb up, it means \"Everything is all right.\" However, in Sardinia and Greece, the gesture is insulting  and should not be used there.\nIn the United States, raising your clasped  hands above your head means \"I'm the champion\" or \"I'm the winner\". It is the sign that prizefighters make when they win a fight. When a leading Russian statesman  made this gesture after a White House meeting, Americans misunderstood and thought he meant he was a winner. In Russia, however, it is a sign of friendship.\nThere are other nonverbal signals that people should be aware of when they go to another country, such as the distance to maintain between speakers. Americans stand closer to each other than English people. English people don't like touching somebody or being touched. Now in America, touch is important. For example friends touch each other on the arm. They often put an arm around a friend when they say \"hello\" or \"goodbye\".",
