  "article": "Yes, it's still 2015, but as USA Today says, \"it's never too early to plan your 2016 travels\". With so many hot destinations   around the globe, \"where should I go?\" can be difficult to answer. According to Lonely Planet, though, Brazil is a fine choice - on April 29, the travel guide named that country the top one to visit in 2016.\n\"As if endless strands of coast and mountains splashed with rainforest didn't already add up to an unfair share of heaven  , Brazil held one of the greatest sporting events in the world, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and the 2016 Summer Olympics, another greatest one, will be followed ,\" explained Lonely Planet.\nBrazil is the largest and most populous country in South America. It boasts   the Amazon, the world's largest jungle  , which is home to a variety of plants and animals. But the great landscape   is not the only thing Brazilians take pride in.\nThe colors green and yellow might make most people think of Brazil's soccer team even more than its national flag. Soccer is more than a sport in Brazil; it's a way of life. In fact, the World Cup brings Brazilians together. It is interesting to note that the general elections   in Brazil are usually held during the same year as the World Cup. Political parties try to take advantage of the patriotic enthusiasm   created by soccer to inspire political energy.\nAlongside soccer, samba is another emblem   of Brazil. The country's most traditional dance is highlighted every February at the Rio Carnival, which is one of the world's biggest.\n\"Brazil has left its second-class nation status  ,\" said former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2009 after Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Olympics.\nBrazil's growing economy, fueled   by oil and aircraft factories, has made it more than just a nation of samba, soccer and beaches. These days, it might just be the best tourist destination in the world.",
