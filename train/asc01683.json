  "article": "A mental professor walked around a room while teaching stress management to an audience. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they'd be asked the \"half empty or half full\" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired : \"How heavy is this glass of water?\"\nDifferent answers called out from the audience.\nShe replied, \"The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb  and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.\"\nShe continued, \"The stress and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed--incapable of doing anything.\"\nIt's important to remember to let go of your stress. As early in the evening as you can, put all your burdens down. Don't carry them through the evening and into the night. Remember to put the glass down!\nComments\nAye Chan Aung---October 27, 2015 at 11:37 am\nShort but valuable! It has clearly taught me how to deal with stress.\nNelson Malicdem--October 28, 2015 at 8:23 pm\nWow! Thanks to the author and to the one who submitted this article. I am experiencing a challenge, as I read this it gives me peace. What exactly is in the article is what I am doing. My burden actually paralyzes me without my knowing it. I should put down the glass of water that I'm holding. Thank you so much!",
