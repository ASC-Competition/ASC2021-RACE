The funny novel follows Plum Kettle, an over-weight advice journalist who answers fan mail for a teen girls' website. She's convinced that her life won't really start until she saves up enough money for her weight-loss operation -- when she'll finally look like the \"perfect\" woman. But after she gets pulled into a series of adventures with a group of women who live life on their own terms, she begins to reconsider her own opinions of what \"beauty\" really is.\nOrhan's Inheritance, by Aline Ohanesian\nAfter Orhan's Turkish grandfather dies, he learns that while he's taken over his grandfather's successful business, the house that's been in his family for generations was not left to him. Instead, it went to an 87-year-old woman who lives in L.A. that no one in his family has ever heard of. To get to the bottom of this, Orhan travels to L.A. to meet with the woman. It's then that he uncovers the secrets of his family.\nSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, by Yuval Noah Harari\nIf the story of evolution   has always interested you, this book is for you.
