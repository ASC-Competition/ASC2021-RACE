  "article": "Jack is a twelve-year-old boy. One day, he was playing football. The ball went into the street and Jack ran for it. Unfortunately, a car hit him. Jack's parents took him to the hospital at once. Jack woke up after a month. When he woke up, he asked, \"Who am I? Who are you? Why am I here?\" He even didn't know his parents. The doctor said, \"Jack's head was badly hurt. Maybe he can remember all the things he has lost one day. Maybe he will forget them forever.\" Every day Jack's parents told Jack something about himself, his friends and so on. But Jack still couldn't think of anything. One day, when his father talked about his dog, Tidy, Jack seemed to think of something. Then Jack's father had an idea. He took Jack back home. Jack and Tidy played together happily. After a year, with the help of Tidy, Jack's memory came back.",
