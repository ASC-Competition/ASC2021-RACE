  "article": "Are you a volcano lover? Here is a list of some of the world's most beautiful volcanoes\nthat our travel agency can offer you to visit. Don't miss them!\nMount Mayon, the Philippines\nLocated about 450 km southeast of Manila on the island of Luzon, Mount Mayon is the\nmost active volcano in the Philippines; a September 2014 eruption forced thousands to flee the\narea. Those who hike the volcano are rewarded with views of the towns in the Albay province\nand the Pacific Ocean. But even those who prefer the view from a distance have a historical\ngood point at the Cagsawa Ruins, once an 18th Century Franciscan church that was destroyed\nby an 1814 eruption.\nKilauea and Marina Kea, Hawaii\nHawaii's volcanoes are known for their active eruptions and extraordinary scenes. Mauna Kea is around one million years old, while Kilauea is the youngest volcano in Hawaii and has\nbeen erupting continuously since 1983. The lava falls straight into the sea, creating fantastic\nforms of black rocks and smoke clouds.\nMount Kelimutu, Indonesia\nKelimutu's three mysterious crater lakes attract both scientists and tourists to the island\nof Flores in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province. One is emerald green  , another\ndark red, and the third pitch black. Scientists say the lakes take on such colors because the\nvolcanic gases met the lakes' minerals centuries ago.",
