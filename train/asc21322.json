  "article": "After eleven years of marriage, a couple had a boy. They were a loving couple and the boy was a gem of their eyes.\nWhen the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for work, so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife who was busy in the kitchen forgot the matter.\nThe boy saw the bottle, playfully went to it, was fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous  medicine. When the child fell to the ground, the mother took him to the hospital in a hurry, where he died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified at how to face her husband.\nWhen the father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and just said, \"I'm with you, darling.\"\nThe child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if only he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened. No one is to blame . She had also lost her only child. What she needed at that moment was consolation  and sympathy  from the husband. That is exactly what he gave her.",
