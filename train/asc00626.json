  "article": "A tender woman, or an independent one, which one would you prefer? Arecent research shows that most people would choose the latter.\nThis type of woman is called a nuhanzi (\"tough woman\"). Experts believe these characteristics have social and psychological roots among young femalesin China. Su Hao's friends all call her a tough woman, because she can finish tough tasks usually carried out by men. For example, she carries 10-litre water to her dormitory on the 5th floor. \"I depend on no one but myself,\" she says.\nAccording to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, tough women have become rather common in society. Of the 21,265 respondents, 78.5 percent said they are familiar with a tough woman. About 50 percent said they like women with tough characteristics, while less than 29 percent expressed the opposite view.\nWhy are tough women gaining popularity? Shen Meng, a psychological consultant, believes the fierce competition in society is contributing to this trend. \"Women are often in a disadvantaged position compared to men,\" Shen says. \"In order to survive, they have to be independent, strong and tough.\" Liu\nXiao lin, professor of psychology at Wuhan Mental Health Center, believes tough women are brought up this way. They are often on close relationship with their fathers, who teach their daughters to be brave and decisive,\" he says. As a result, these women are more likely to be psychologically healthy and more tolerant to stress, according to Liu.\nThough Liu believes that this is a good trend, Hu Shenzhi, a psychologist at the Guangdong Sunflower Counseling Center, says the popularity of tough woman indicates an unclear line between gender identities, which can lead to relationship problems. \"Some women with characteristics that differ from the traditional female image may have a difficult time finding Mr Right,\" he says.\"Even if they get married, their manly characteristics might cause family conflicts.",
