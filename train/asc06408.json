  "article": "Chicago is considering firm measures to prevent the Asian carp,a giant fish native to the Far East,from coming into North America's Great Lakes in large numbers.Such a move could cost up to$18bn,a heavy economic burden to the city.\nThis species,more than a metre in length,was originally introduced to southern US states three decades ago to control weeds in sewage treatment plants.But they escaped into the Mississippi River and increased in number quickly,making their way north towards the Great Lakes and threatening the native fish species along the way.\n\"Dozens of them will often leap out of the water as boats approach.''Michael Beecham,a local environmental expert,described how frightening the scene was.\"I've gone down the river and seen these fish jump up and hit me in the face.It is a big problem for our native species,\" he said.\nA meeting has been organized to find a technological solution to the carp problem,one of which involves blocking parts of Chicago's canal system.Listening at the meeting was John Goss,who was worried about the effect that having barriers in the canal system would have on industry.\"It would certainly increase the cost of transportation,\"he told.\"It is currently very cheap and efficient to bring materials and finished goods down the Chicago ship canal.''\nAnother cheaper option is to eat the fish out of existence.Dirk Fucik is selling carp burger at his fish shop not far from downtown Chicago.He thinks the carps are a great resource.\"To catch it and throw it away is a waste,\"he says.\"Eating them helps solve the problem and also provides jobs.\"But the idea has not yet caught on.So far,he is the only person in Chicago selling carp burgers.",
