  "article": "There was once a young man called Paul in a village in the USA. Paul was very lazy because his father was a rich farmer and he didn't have to work. Mr Smith, a neighbour of his, was a blacksmith  . He used to work in his shop all day. Paul spent hours and hours watching how the blacksmith worked every day. \"Young man, why don't you try your hand to make a shoe tack  , even it is only to pass the time?\" said the blacksmith one day, \" Maybe it will be useful to you some day.\" Finally, the lazy boy began to have a try. After practicing some times, he becameskilledand could make very nice tacks.\nYears later, Paul's father died and he lost all the things because of a war  . He had to move to another country and live by himself. It happened that there were many shoemakers paying high prices to buy tacks for the shoes, because in that part of the country there was a great need of tacks for soldiers' shoes. Paul went to talk with them. He told them that he would make the tacks if they could help him find a workshop in the village. The shoemakers agreed. Then Paul made a lot of money by making tacks. \"How funny it is!\" he said to himself, \"Even by making shoe tacks, one can become rich.\"",
