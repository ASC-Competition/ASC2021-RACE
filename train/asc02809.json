  "article": "George Gershwin was born in New York City in 1898. His parents were Russian Jews who had immigrated to the United States. George and his two brothers and sister had a close, happy family life. George liked playing games on the streets of New York. He liked exploring the city. He did not like school or studying.\nWhile exploring the city, George heard jazz and blues music in and out of public drinking places. However, he did not become seriously interested in music until he heard another boy playing the violin in a concert at his school. George began to take piano lessons. His teacher was a fine classical musician. He immediately recognized George's unusual ability. The teacher wrote about him to a friend: \"I have a student who will make his mark in music, if anybody will. The boy is a genius, without doubt. \"\nGeorge studied classical piano. But his strongest interest continued to be jazz and popular music. At the age of fifteen, he left school and went to work in the music business.  At that time, the New York City street where most music publishers had their offices was called \"Tin Pan Alley.\" The piano players played the songs all day long to interested singers and other performers. George Gershwin was one of the youngest piano players in Tin Pan Alley. Soon, he was considered one of the finest there. He was already writing his own songs. He succeeded in getting one published when he was only eighteen years old.\nGeorge Gershwin was now a real composer. The rest of his life was an unbroken record of success. He wrote song after song. His ideas were so endless that he was not even troubled when he once lost some music he had been writing. \"There is plenty more where that came from,\" he said.\nGeorge Gershwin had his first big hit in 1919, when he was twenty-one years old. It was a song called \"Swanee.\" A popular entertainer, Al Jolson, sang the song. \"Swanee\" was made into one of the first musical recordings. George Gershwin was suddenly famous.",
