  "article": "The Washington post - NASA's newest space habitat looks sort of like a kids' moon bonce, a big, bright, inflatable globe that could be lots of fun to play in. Soon astronauts on the International Space Station could get the chance to try . The expandable habitat made by Bigelow Aerospace recently passed NASA's strict certification requirements and is scheduled to be flown to the station in September.\nCalled the BEAM ( Bigelow Expandable Activity Module), the habitat would be attached to the space station, where it would stay for two years. While there, it would be tested to see how it handles  the _ of space - the radiation, the station's movement and even how it stands up to the debris   flying around in orbit.\nThe private Las Vegas company, founded by millionaire real estate mogul  Robert Bigelow, won a $17.8 million contract from NASA to provide the module to the space station.\n\"Today is the first step, but it's a big step,\" said Bigelow's George Zamka. Replace the space station or make it larger. It also hopes to build the habitats on the moon. Its B330 module would be even bigger, with 330 cubic meters of internal ( ) space. The modules could be connected. Creating research facilities, the company says, or even space hotels.\nIn an interview ,NASA's William  Gerstenmaier, said he was eager to see how the module performs , and said he was especially  pleased \" to see how the private sector can step up and help us meet our requirements.\" The module will be flown to the space station by SpaceX, the first commercial company to resupply the space station.",
