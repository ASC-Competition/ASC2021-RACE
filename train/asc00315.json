  "article": "When I set out to drop my dad of fat the airport,it was dark and dreary .It started to rain on the way.When I left the airport,the visibility wasn't clear because of the drops of rain.It was before 6 am.\nEven though the road conditions were poor,I drove at my normal speed.I was angry with the more cautious drivers ahead of me that were delaying my drive.The exit ramp to the highway was a tight spiral .It is a dangerous spot in good weather and totally scary when the weather is miserable or it is dark.But I didn't want to slow down and arrive home any later than necessary.I drove down the ramp too fast.The road was wet and my car slid,landing face down on the passenger side.\nI didn't like to drive by myself at the time and had debated taking my husband and son with me on the trip.Thankfully,I was alone in the car.My accident was slight.In fact, I was lucky enough not to have a single scratch.I _ to think the injuries my son would have suffered had he been in the backseat of that car with no seatbelt when it rolled.After the ear rolled three times,I found my mobile phone was lost in a pile of small things that were all lying in the bottom of the car.A lady was kind enough to let me borrow her mobile phone,but with-out the numbers preprogrammed who could I call? I was lucky enough to remember my father's mobile phone number,and fortunate that he hadn't yet got on his plane.\nYou never know when an accident will happen.As a driver,I will keep safety in mind by obeying all traffic laws and have safe-driving habits,especially in bad weather.Insist your children always wear their seatbehs.Life is a journey and everyone should value it and enjoy the ride.",
