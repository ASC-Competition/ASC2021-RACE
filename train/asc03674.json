He got quite a good job with a building company, and as he did not drink or smoke, he saved up quite a lot of money.\nHis wife's parents were still in Ireland, and one day she got a telegram saying that her mother was ill, so Pat gave her some money and she went to Ireland to see her mother.\nAfter a week, Pat wanted to write a letter to her, but he could not read or write very well, so he went to his priest and asked him to do it for him. Pat told the priest what he wanted to say, and the priest wrote it down. After a few minutes Pat stopped, and the priest said,\" Do you want to say more?\"\n\"Only ,\" 'Please excuse the bad writing and spelling',\" Pat said.",
