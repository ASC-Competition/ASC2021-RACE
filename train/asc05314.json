  "article": "A famous foreign company that invested in China wanted to employ a reception secretary for its public relation department.\nA beautiful girl with a master degree in electric engineering became a winning candidate  through the difficult process of employment. At its last stage she faced an oral test together with another girl who was her equal not only in good looks but also in education standard. The girl we talk about was confident in herself and successful in the oral test. It seemed that she would get the chance. The examiner told her on behalf of the company that she could come to office of company next Monday as a new employee. At last he asked her, \"Have you anything else to say? Shocked by the unexpected question, the beautiful girl was quite at a loss, saying with hesitation ,\"\"I have to talk with my parents before I give an answer.\"Surprised, the examiner said calmly,\"In that case, let's wait till you are ready.\"\nThe next day the girl came to tell that her parents agreed to her beginning work next Monday. But the examiner said regretfully,\"Sorry, the job position is filled by another suitable candidate. You had better have a try in another place.\"The beautiful girl was surprised. She asked for an explanation and was told,\"What is needed here is a person who knows her own mind.\"\nThat was how a good opportunity slipped away right under the nose of a beautiful girl.",
