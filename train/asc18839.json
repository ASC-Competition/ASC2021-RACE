  "article": "Mary had some troubles, so she went to see the doctor.  He was a new doctor, and did not know her.  So he first asked her some questions. One of the questions was, \"What is your age?\"\n\"Well...\" Mary answered, \"I don't quite remember, doctor, but I will try to think.\" She thought for a while and then said, \"Yes, I remember now, doctor. When I married, I was twenty-two years old, and my husband was thirty then. Now he is sixty, I know, and that is twice thirty. And so I am twice twenty-two. That is forty-four, isn't it?\"",
