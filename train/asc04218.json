  "article": "To the Editor,\nI have been reading your newspaper, theHometown Gazette, for the past two years, ever since I moved to Smithville. We moved here from New York City, so I am accustomed to reading excellent newspapers such asThe New York Times. In fact, we still have theTimesdelivered on Sundays. The entire family enjoys reading the recipes  in the newspaper, as well as the Styles section.\nTheTimesis great, but theGazetteis another story. I've never read an article that doesn't contain at least three or four spelling or grammatical errors. For instance, in last week's issue, you misspelled the word \"secretary\" used a singular verb with a plural noun, and used \"it's\" as a possessive . And that was just in the lead story! In case you never went to elementary school, \"it's\" means \"it is\". It's not a possessive adjective!\nIt's a pity that this tiny little hick   town has only one newspaper, because I' d like to have an alternative to the rag   you publish. I find it hard to believe your news stories. If you can' t spell correctly, how can you get your facts right?\nI've been meaning to get this off my chest for some time. Please cancel my subscription . And buy yourself a dictionary.\nSincerely,\nJane Z. Jones",
