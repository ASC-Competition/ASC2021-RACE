  "article": "Diving or Drowning\nA rich young man decided that he would like to do some diving in the sea, so he bought a rubber suit and all the other things that he needed, and took some lessons at a diving school. Then one day he walked into the water by himself and began to explore the bottom of the sea.\nHe saw a lot of beautiful fish and other things, and then, after half an hour, he suddenly saw a man waving his arms and legs around wildly near the bottom of the sea. He was wearing only a bathing suit.\nThe rich young man was very surprised to see him, so he took out a plastic notebook and a special pencil, which could write under water, and wrote, \"What are you doing here?\"\nHe showed the notebook to the other man, who then took the pencil and wrote, \"Drowning!\"",
