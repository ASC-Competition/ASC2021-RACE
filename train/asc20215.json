  "article": "It was a bright Saturday morning. I stopped at a cafe to enjoy a cup of coffee and read the morning newspaper. Suddenly, I felt a hand on the back of my jacket and heard someone say, \"Hey Steve! How are you doing?\"\nLooking back, I saw a man. He looked familiar, but I couldn't remember where we had met.\nThe young man also held a cup of coffee, so I asked him to join me. Very soon, his story began to _ my memory.\nFive years earlier, Johnson was traveling home late on a February night. A heavy snow had arrived that afternoon, and by midnight, the snowdrifts were getting deep. His car was stuck in a snowdrift just down the road from my house.\nHe walked to my house for help. I helped him pull his car out of the snowdrift and up to the street where the snow had been cleaned away.\nThis was a normal happening here during the winter. I couldn't count the times someone has helped me to pull my car from a snowdrift. However, it was an unforgettable experience for him. He was only eighteen at that time, and he said he was very afraid. No one wants to be stuck in a snowdrift at night.\nSometimes, one simple kindness at the right moment can change the direction of a life. So, be kind and helpful.",
