  "article": "Car sharing is another way to drive green that's gaining in popularity, especially in urban areas.People who may not drive every day but still want a car to run errands  or drive on weekends benefit most from car sharing.Car sharing is usually run by a service like Zipcar, though there are non-profit  and informal car sharing services.Members pay a monthly fee and have access to an entire fleet of cars when they need one.The cars are parked in fixed spots around the city, so members only need to make a reservation, and then go to the pickup spot.\nCar sharing has major environmental benefits because it reduces the number of cars on the road.Members don't drive just because they are in a car.They plan trips, and if they don't need a car, they don't use one.Still, a car is available to them if they need to make a big trip to the grocery store, pick someone up at the airport or if they want to go to the beach for the day.Members also benefit by having access to a car without any of the headaches of ownership.They usually don't have to pay for the gas, insurance or maintenance  , and the monthly membership fee is less than a typical car payment.So if you really want to go green but aren't ready to totally give up a car yet, car sharing may be the way to go.\nIf you still need to get around, but want to go even greener than sharing a car, share a bus!",
