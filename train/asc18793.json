The head of the Community, Zhao Fuqin, said, \"The first Sunday, only eleven people came, but we picked up over seven big bags of rubbish  from the sidewalk and street. The next weekend, twenty people came, and filled eight rubbish bags. Now the neighborhood really looks great!\"\nThe Neighborhood Watch Program\nThe neighbors on Xin'an Street began this program to look for problems in the neighborhood and to call the police if necessary. The neighbors all say the watch has already helped.\nSunYan, aged 60, a retired teacher, said, \"In the past, I felt afraid at night. Now I know my neighbors are watching for trouble. \" According to the police, there are fewer problems on Xin'an Street. \"Calls to 110 went down last month. _ knew that the people on Xin'an Street were watching, so they stayed away,\" said a policeman.\nThe Neighborhood Fitness Program\nA Health Club was built last month, where the neighbors can do different kinds of sports like basketball, ping-pong ball, tennis, etc. \"Every morning you can see groups of neighbors running, dancing and playing Taijiquan. We have come to realize the importance of taking exercise,\" said Chen Jinliang, a businessman of 45.\nThe community has more plans. \"We plan to start the Kids Care Program for children.
