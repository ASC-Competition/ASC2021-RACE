Users of social-networking sites have on average 121 online friends as compared with physical ones. The study also claims that people tend to be more open, confident and honest with their virtual friends than their \"real\" ones.\n\"For most people , the Internet is a way of keeping in touch with loved ones and friends, but for people who are isolated due to illness, it plays a more vital role, and can often act as a lifeline.\" says Helen Oxley, a psychologist at Wythenshawe hospital.\n\"People with illnesses often rely on the Internet to facilitate  friendships, since they blog and use networking sites as a way of dealing with their illness. It can foster a sense of social connection for those who frequently feel isolated, which is important to psychological well-being.\"\nIn wider society, the ways in which friendships are formed are changing, with people recognizing that they can develop deep and meaningful connections with others that they've never met, and may never meet. About one in 10 people has either met their best friends online, or believes they can make lifelong friends on the Web.\nThe findings highlight how social introductions are also changing. Only five percent would ask for someone's phone number, while 23 percent are now likely to ask for an email address or a full name with the intention of adding the person to their social network.\nAt the same time, however, a questionnaire completed by 4,427 suggests that 20 percent of parents believe their children's education is affected by surfing the Net. They think their children are doing poorly at the school due to the amount of time they spend on non-educational websites.",
