  "article": "An ancient philosopher felt: be content with what you have; be pleased about the way things are. When you realize that, the whole world belongs to you.\nWhen we can be grateful for what we have, and take our focus off what we think we are short of, it's amazing how our feelings will shift to a place of peace and happiness. The reason for \"an attitude of thankfulness\" isn't necessarily so that God can hear our appreciation, but perhaps so that we can live happily and peacefully, with a feeling of \"all is well\".\nHave you ever experienced this-the feeling that \"what is\" is great, and there is no need to wish for things to be different? It's a wonderful feeling and a great way to go through life.\nHere's an example: We have strong winds in the desert at times, and the other day the high winds broke three arms on the beautiful mimosa tree in my back yard.  The tree's arms are twisted and the leaves and flowers are dying. It looks hurt and brown.\nWell, that's certainly one way to choose to look at it, And if I choose that way, then I can allow myself to get upset that the tree has been hurt, that there will be less shade in the yard, that I have to cut up and pull away the branches, etc. OR I can choose to see that \"all is well\" -that nature does what it does, that trees will lose branches, that the yard is not a _ thing, but it is alive. In other words, I can choose to be okay with \"what is\".\nEither way, the tree situation hasn't changed-I've simply changed how I choose to interpret it. My interpretation then affects my emotions, my state of peacefulness, my happiness with things, etc.\nWhen I choose to be content with \"what is\", to be pleased about the way things are, and to see that nothing is missing, that everything is just fine, then I choose to be at peace. Suddenly, the whole world looks beautiful. Instead of seeing problems, I see reality. I see \"what is\" and I am okay with it.\nTry seeing everything and accepting everything just the way it is.  And watch the world open up to you.",
