  "article": "Young people are perhaps better-known for spending money than saving it. But some new banking websites are seeking to change that. These websites offer young people the information and tools they need to watch over their money. The websites also let the users share their financial experiences with other young people.\nNineteen-year-old Alix Scott has been working at a store this summer. She is saving money to pay for college next year. \"I have to save for all my college money because my parents can't afford to co-sign on loans. So, I have to rely on my own savings.\"\nBut instead of putting her money in a local bank, Miss Scott began using SmartyPig, a web-based banking service.\nSmartPig was developed by Michael Ferrari with a friend in 2007. It is really all about helping people save for very specific goals, such as a wedding, a vocation or an IPhone.\nMICHAEL FERRARI said : \"For example, you want to save five thousand dollars for a vacation in three years. SmartyPig will actually calculate how much money you need to save every month. You don't have to move from your existing bank, we'll actually go in and withdraw those funds on the day you specify every month and we'll put it into your SmartyPig account, where it'll earn interest, as well.\"\nSmartyPig also enables outsiders to add money to the accounts of its users. \"Perhaps  a holiday is coming up or your birthday is coming up, and rather than getting a gift, your friends, your family can actually contribute to any of your SmartyPig goals.\"Mr.Ferrari said. He believes that as technology continues to develop, more and more people will use the electronic banking sites.\nA growing number of young people have shown an interest in online banking sites like SmartyPig. They say they like the ease of operation and services the sites offer. These personal finance websites offer tools that help users follow their spending, set up a budget, and combine their investments. And they all involve social media, which interests young adults who are already at ease about sharing their personal information online.",
