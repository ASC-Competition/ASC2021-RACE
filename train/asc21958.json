  "article": "There have always been a lot of commonly believed but false  ideas about being fat and doing exercise. Some people believe that they can't help putting an weight as they get older, while others hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles  will turn into fat. Here are some more myths.\nI'll never lose weight--I come from a fat family\nWrong! While we can't change the body type we are born with, we can't blame our genes  for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habit of eating too much and exercise too little.\nI am fat because I burn calories slowly\nWrong! Fatness is not caused by a slow metabolism . In fact, although fat people consume   more energy than slim people, they also fail to realize how much they eat. Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately .\nExercise is boring\nWrong! Anything will become boring if you do it again and again. The key is to develop a balanced and varied  program that's fun as well as progressive . If you enjoy a Sunday walk, take a different mute. If you do yoga , try a tai chi class.\nNo pain, no gain\nWrong! Exercise is not meant to hurt. Indeed, pain is your body telling you something's wrong, and continuing to exercise could lead to serious injury . You may experience mild discomfort as you begin to exercise regularly, but this is your body _ the positive changes in your lifestyle and the aches should disappear quickly. If they don't, rest and ask for medical advice.",
