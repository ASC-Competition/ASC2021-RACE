  "article": "A man had seven sons, who were always quarreling. They left their studies and work, to quarrel among themselves. Some bad men were looking forward to the death of their father, to cheat them out of their property  by making them quarrel about it.\nThe good old man, one day, called his sons around him. He laid before them seven sticks, which were tied together. He said, \"I will pay a hundred dollars to the one who can break this bundle .\"\nEach one tried their best to break the bundle. After a long but useless efforts, they all said that it could not be done.\n\"And yet, my boys,\" said the father, \"nothing is easier to do.\" He then untied the bundle, and broke the sticks, one by one, with perfect ease.\n\"Ah!\" said his sons, \"It is easy enough to do it so; anybody could do it in that way.\"\nTheir father replied, \"As it is with these sticks, so it is with you, my sons. So long as you hold fast together and help each other, you will be much richer, and none can harm you.\n\"But if the brotherhood bundle is broken, it will happen to you just as it has to these sticks, which lie there broken on the ground.\"\nHome, city, country, all are property found, When they hold tightly together.",
