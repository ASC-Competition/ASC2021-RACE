  "article": "(part of Yanglan's speech in Beijing's bid for the 2008 Olympic games)\nMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen. Good afternoon!\nBefore I introduce our cultural programs, I want to tell you one thing first about 2008. You're going to have a great time in Beijing.\nMany people are fascinated by China's sport legends in history. For example, back to Song Dynasty, about the 11th century, people started to play a game called Cuju, which is regarded as the origin of ancient football. The game was very popular and women were also participating. Now, you will understand why our women football team is so good today.\nWith a concept inspired by the famed Silk Road, our Torch Relay will break new ground, traveling from Olympia through some of the oldest civilizations known to man-Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Byzantine, Mesopotamian, Persian, Arabian, Indian and Chinese. Carrying the message \"Share the Peace, Share the Olympics,\" the eternal flame will reach new heights as it crosses the Himalayas over the world's highest summit - Mount Qomolangma, which is known to many of you as Mt. Everest. In China, the flame will pass through Tibet, cross the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, travel the Great Wall and visit Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and the 56 ethnic communities who make up our society. On its journey, the flame will be seen by and inspire more human beings than any previous relay.\nI am afraid I can not present the whole picture of our cultural programs within such a short period of time. Before I end, let me share with you one story. Seven hundred years ago, amazed by his incredible editions of a far away land of great beauty, people asked Marco Polo whether his stories about China were true. He answered: What I have told you was not even half of what I saw. Actually, what we have shown you here today is only a fraction of Beijing that awaits you.\nLadies and gentlemen, I believe that Beijing will prove to be a land of wonders to athletes, spectators  and the worldwide television audience alike. Come and join us.\nThank you, Mr. President. Thank you all.",
