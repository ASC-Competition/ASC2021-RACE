It fell into the water when I was cutting the wood.\nThe fairy showed him a gold axe and asked, \"Is this yours?\".\n\"No,\" said the man.\nThe fairy then showed him a silver axe and asked again, \"Is this yours?\" \"No,\" again answered the man.\nThen she showed him the old axe.\n\"Yes, that is mine,\"called out the happy man.\n\"I know that well enough,\" said the fairy.\"I only wanted to see if you would tell me the truth, and now I'll give you the gold axe and the silver axe besides your own one.\"",
