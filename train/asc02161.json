  "article": "Most schools forbid chewing gum, but in a few years they might consider changing that rule. Why? Scientists are finding evidence that gum chewing may be good for your health. It may even help improve your test scores.\nThis exciting research is just beginning. And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath.\nOther researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining   of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines   can.\nThat discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial   gums that cure bad breath.\nThose projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake.\nResearchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert. Each stick has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. It can take an hour for the caffeine in coffee to have its full effect, but the caffeine in Stay Alert _ in just a few minutes.\nThe gum is easy to transport and it's stable in cold and hot climates. Unlike a pill, it doesn't require water to swallow. Those qualities make it easy for soldiers to use.\nFor now, Stay Alert is available only to the military  . The manufacturer may one day offer it for sale to the public. People who work at night, such as truck drivers and medical personnel who ride in ambulances, might benefit from a product like Stay Alert.",
