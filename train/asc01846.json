Her fortune is estimated at $ 100 million, more than many famous actors and musicians earn.\nSo how did it all start?\nGrumpy Cat's owner Tabatha Bundesen was working as a waitress when her brother Bryan decided to take a photo of her funny-looking cat and post it on Reddit, the social-news site. In a matter of hours, she became a sensation .\nIt got 1 million views on Imgur in 48 hours.\nGrumpy Cat's real name is Tardar Sauce and she actually has a condition called dwarfism, which makes her constantly frowning. But that unique frown turned out to be worth millions of dollars.\nTabatha, who lives in Arizona in US, isn't complaining. She still remembers that September 22, 2012, when her life turned upside down.\nSince her cat became a worldwide phenomenon, she was able to quit her job and devote her life to managing her cat's modeling career. Sounds unbelievable, but it's true. She says that her only job now is to book Tardar's photo shoots, commercials , and other appearances.\nWhat are the other benefits of owning a million-dollar cat?\nApart from not having to work, Tabatha can travel all the time. She has time and money to visit her family more often and enjoy her life. She never could have imagined just how huge her cat would become, but she always knew Tardar was very special. And she is glad to see her cat bringing joy to so many people around the world.\nAs for the millions of dollars Grumpy has earned, they come from all the products, commercials and a best-selling book. She even has her own movie--Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever.",
