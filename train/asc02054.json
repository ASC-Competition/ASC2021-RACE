It is also something you can do with other people, which can be great fun. So, it is important to find time to exercise and be healthier. As well as making time to exercises, another way is to build it into the natural rhythm   of your day.\n* Go for a walk on your lunch break.\nTry to find at least three different ways and change them throughout the week. It\nmight even be possible to find a place to walk inside, for those bad weather days.\n* Talk to your employers about improving health at work.\nEncourage your workers to cycle to and from work. You might also be able to\nencourage them to set up a gymnasium. Sell the idea by pointing out that doing so\nwill improve productivity  , and make workers happy.\n* If you are a student.\nGo for walks with friends to talk about your studies. Spend some time in the learning\nresource centre reading about sport, exercise and health. The more you know, the\nmore choices you will have about how to be physically active.
