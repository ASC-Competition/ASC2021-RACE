  "article": "\"Whatever\",totally tops most annoying word in the poll .So, you know, it is what it is, but Americans are totally annoyed by the use of \"whatever,,in conversations. The popular term of indifference was found most annoying in conversations by 47 percent of the Americans surveyed in a Marist College poll on Wednesday.\n\"Whatever\" easily beat out \"you know,\" which especially annoyed a quarter of interviewers. The other annoying expressions were \"anyway\"(at 7 percent), \"it is what it is',(11percent) and \"at the end of the day\"(2 percent).\n\"Whatever\" is an expression with staying power. It left everyone a deep impression in the song by Nirvana (\"oh well, whatever, never mind\")in 1991 and was popularized by the Valley Girls in the film \"Clueless\",later that decade. It is still commonly used, often by younger people.\nIt can be a common argument-ender or a signal of indifference. And it can really be annoying. The poll found '\"whatever\" to be consistently disliked by Americans regardless of their race, sex, age, income or where they live.\n\"It doesn't surprise me because 'whatever,is in a special class, probably,,,said Michael Adams, author of \"Slang ~The People's Poetry\" and an associate professor of English at Indiana University. \"It's a word that  and it depends on how a speaker uses it  can suggest being not worthy of attention or respect.',Adams, who didn't take part in the poll and is not annoyed by \"whatever,\" points out that its use is not always negative. \"It can also be used in place of other neutral phrases that have fallen out of favor, like 'six of one, half dozen of the other,.\" he said. However, he also noted that the negative meaning of the word might explain why \"whatever,was judged more annoying than the ever-popular \"you know\".",
