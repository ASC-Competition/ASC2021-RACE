  "article": "Climate change, global warming, the greenhouse effect ... these days nobody denies that there is something strange and worrying happening to the atmosphere. Scientists are puzzled by the rise in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They are afraid that the world may be a short way from what they refer to as uncontrolled global warming.\nAt Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, meteorologists  have been carefully monitoring the amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere for the past 50 years. Until recently, there has been a gradual increase of around 1.5 parts per million (ppm). In 2013 the figure rose to 2.08 ppm and in the following year they registered an increase of 2.54 ppm.\n.Climate analysts feel that it istoo soon to draw conclusions about the phenomenon although the public are concerned that the carbon dioxide emissions are getting out of control. Jason Samenow, the chief meteorologist in the American National Weather Service,thinks that instead of having decades to find a solution to the problem, people might have only a few years. He believes that the Earth's natural systems for absorbing the gas are breaking down resulting in the uncontrolled green house effect. He insists that this is something that could happen if the Earth'stemperatures rose to such a degree that it was unable to contain the heat. .\nOne interesting aspect of this climate change ng down resulting in the uncontrolled greenhouse effect. He insists that this is something that could happen if the Earth's temperatures rose to such a degree that it was unable to contain the heat.is that it is not happening in a uniform way around the world. Carbon dioxide levels in the South Pole are noticeably lower. This suggests that something has happened in the northern hemisphere that set off the rise. Forest fires in North America might hold the answer to the puzzle, along with very hot summers in Europe.\nThe 2014 heat wave was certainly out of the ordinary. Statistics claim that more than 30,000 people lost their lives as a direct result of the high temperatures. Scientists are being cautious in their interpretations. Most feel that it is too soon to say that a new trend has been set. All agree that the phenomenon needs to be closely observed.",
