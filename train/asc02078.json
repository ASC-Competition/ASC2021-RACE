  "article": "Baths and bathing have been considered of an important medical therapy to man. In Greece there are the ruins of a bath tub and water system built over 3 000 years ago. The Romans had warm public baths. In some public baths as many 3 000 persons could bathe at the same time.\nTreating diseases by bathing has been popular for centuries. Modern medical bathing, or _ , first became popular in Europe and by the late 1 700's also became popular in the United States.\nFor many years frequent bathing was believed to be bad for one's health. Ordinary bathing just to be clean was avoided, and perfume  was used to cover up body and smell.\nBy the 1 700's doctors began to say that soap and water were good for health. They believed that it was good for people to be clean. Slowly, people began to bathe more frequently.\nIn the United States ordinary bathing was slow to become popular. During the 18th and early 19th centuries, many Americans were known as \"the great unwashed\". In one American city, for example, a person could only take a bath every 30 days! That was a law.\nFrequency of bathing today is partly a matter of habit. People know that bathing for cleanliness is important to health. Doctors know that dirty bodies increase that chance of disease.\nTherefore in the United States people generally bathe often.",
