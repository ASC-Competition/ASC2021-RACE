    "Apples contain no   _  ."

  "article": "Every heard the old saying, \"An apple a day keeps the doctor away\"? It is true! Apples have a lot of nutritional value!\nA medium sized apple has only 80 calories  . What a great snack choice! Not only is an apple low in calories, they contain absolutely no fat. Thus, eating apples as snacks, as opposed to chips or cakes, will help reduce the risk of cancer.\nOn top of reducing the risk of cancer, the low sodium   amounts in apples also help reduce high blood pressure and heart disease. They are cholesterol   free. They are also rich in vitamin A, which helps strengthen vision   along with bone and tooth development.\nNow that we know the nutritional facts, let's take a look at some of the fun facts--That's right! Apples can be fun, as well as healthy!\nIf an apple is fresh, it will float on water. Twenty-five percent of an apple is air, thus allowing it to float. Can you imagine bobbing   for apples that sink?\nAnd, did you know that an apple is covered with a natural layer of wax  ? That's what the peeling   is. It protects the apple's high water content, keeping the apple fresh.\nApples are a very important part of a healthy diet, but keep in mind they can be fun. And always remember, if an apple sinks in water, pick another one to bob for!",
