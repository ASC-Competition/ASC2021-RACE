  "article": "The television news feature about Ben Heckmann, an eighth grader from Farmington, Minn, was breathless in its praise. \"At 14, he has accomplished something many adults can't achieve,\" the reporter said, \"Ben is a twice-published author.\" But Ben's two \"Velvet Black\" books, describing a fictional rock band, were not picked from a pile of manuscripts by an eagle eyed publisher. They were self-published, at the cost of $400 by Ben's parents.\nOver the past five years, print-on-demand technology and a growing number of self publishing companies whose books can be sold online have inspired writers of all ages to avoid the traditional gatekeeping system for determining who could call himself a \"published author.\"\nThe mothers and fathers who foot the bill say they are simply trying to encourage their children, in the same way that other parents buy equipment for a promising baseball player.

Ben's father, Ken, said Ben's ambitions \"weren't to knockHarry Potteroff the list,\" but \"to get that good feeling inside that you've done something.\"\nAjla Dizdarevic, 12, who has self-published two books of poetry, has been on television and in local newspapers. \"Being a published author,\" she said, \"was always a dream of mine.\" Her new dream: three books by age 15.",
