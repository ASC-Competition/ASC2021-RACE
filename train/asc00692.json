Many people hold ideas about jobs and careers that are holding them back.Let's see the truth behind some career myths.\nA CV   is the only way to get a job.\nTo tell the truth, many employers don't like or actually read CVs.Some employers would prefer to judge a person after a face-to-face meeting, or give them some part-time work first to see what they are truly like in the workplace.\nHaving an up-to-date CV is important when applying for jobs advertised in the paper, from larger organizations, or when you want to leave some information about yourself for the employers.\nI have to make my decision now and stick to it.\nThere is a great saying: \"Life is a journey not a destination.\" Journeys are full of options.You make and change your decisions all the time based on new experiences and information.\nYes, you do have to make decisions, but you do not have to be limited by those career decisions by sticking to them.What's more important is having a go and exploring new things.\nI can't get into the work I like because there are too few opportunities.\nI have no doubt getting into work that you really want to do can be challenging.But I do also believe opportunities exist in most career areas because employment needs change all the time.One strategy I'd suggest if you can't get your dream job is to go after what you want and grab any opportunity that moves you toward your dream job.\nIt's the school's responsibility to talk about careers and work.\nSchools do have a part to play in providing career advice for students, but others also have a responsibility.I would suggest that a student-parent-school partnership approach is a far better way of looking at this.A lot of information is available on the internet, in the newspapers, through relatives and friends.",
