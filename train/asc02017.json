  "article": "Although there are no state controlled survival courses in Britain or the United States,there are various independent organizations offering similar activities.Students can participate(take part)in outdoor training courses through university clubs and societies.Anyone can register with such groups,which then organize courses,training and trips for all members.\nOne of the most popular outdoor training programmes in both the US and Britain is Outward Bound .It was founded in 1941 in Wales and attracts hundreds of thousands of adventurous types every year. The courses are intended to broaden minds through experiences that build confidence, self-esteem and character.As well as specialist courses such as canoeing,leadership skills and sailing,participants can take part in week long adventure training camps which include a host of sports and survival training education skills.\nMichael Williams,an American student,took part in an Outward Bound course last year.He said:\"We learned lots of first aid skills,lots of natural history ,lots of environmental facts, and participated in a wildlife preservation programme.Beyond that,my favorite skills learned were sailing and rock climbing.\"Courses can last up to 40 days and are open to anyone over the age of 14.Students must be in general good health,but do not need to be experienced in outdoor-sports.There is no selection process;everyone is welcome,although new participants are advised to pick a course matching their physical capacity.Most of the British courses take place in the Brecon Beacons in Wales.Another similar organization is the UK Survival School,which includes courses on learning to 1ive with the environment, sailing and  winter survival.On a basic survival weekend students will learn how to get water and food, how to make fire and cook with it,to find and build a shelter,control survival life support,how to cross rivers.Send off a distress signal,and to use compasses by day and night.\nAccording to the leaders,such adventures are \"an awakening, an exploration into the unknown.\"Outward Bound believes that participants will \"use mind and body traveling some of the Earth's roughest wilderness areas.\"",
