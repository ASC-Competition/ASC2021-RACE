  "article": "Teenagers at one German school are learning how to achieve happiness alongside subjects like maths and languages.\nThe class sit in a circle with their eyes shut and count from one to ten: one begins, the next voice comes from the far right, a third from the other side. The aim is to listen for an opportunity to shout the number without clashing  with another voice or leaving a pause. On the first try, most of the young Germans try to be first, while a few are too shy to join in. But by the fifth round, they develop a rhythm.\nThe message: giving other people space but also confidently claiming your own space is a requirement for social well-being.\nWhile the game suggests a soft course for the less bright, the school says it is trying to make it affect even clever pupils. The Willy Hellpach School is the first in the nation to develop a happiness course, intended for 17-19-year-olds preparing for university-entrance exams. \"The course isn't there to make you happy,\" Ernst Fritz-Schubert, the school principal, warned the pupils who were taking the course, \"but rather to help you discover the ways to become happy.\" Cooking a meal together will be one of the class exercises, along with improving body language under the guidance of two professional actresses.\n\"In the first period, we had to each say something positive about another member of the class and about ourselves. No laughing at people or teasing,\" said Fanny, 17.\nThe message: self-esteem  improves happiness too.\nThe course is taught for three periods a week and will be graded as a part of overall assessment. Despite the happy subject, the pupils themselves insist it is no laughing matter. Max, 18, says he is happy when he finds people who share his interests. Janina, 18, says she needs to be fit to feel happy.\n\"We want to show how proper food or exercise can help in becoming happy,\" the principal said. He hopes other schools in Germany will copy the idea. The school has attracted national interest since it announced its new course.",
