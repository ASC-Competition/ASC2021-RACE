  "article": "Accidents often happen. It's necessary for us to remember these tips.\nOn your way home or to school: Wait for the green traffic light, and look left and right before you cross the road. If you see a car coming, don't cross until it really stops.\nAt school: Never run around too fast at school. When students around you begin to push, try to hold something.  If you fall down in a crowed   place, cover your head with both hands.\nWhen there's a fire: Keep quiet and leave quickly. Use a piece of wet cloth to cover your mouth and nose so that you don't breathe in smoke. If your clothes catch fire, drop to the ground and roll   from side to side to put out the fire.\nFor eating: Wash fruit like apples or pears carefully before you eat it. And if your food looks or smells bad, don't eat it.\nAbout strange invitations: If an Internet friend asks to meet you, tell your parents about it. Don't go alone.",
