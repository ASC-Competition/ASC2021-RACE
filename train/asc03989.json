The result was the release of Austin's first album,Junior Year. While it seems like a sudden rise for the teenager, Austin admits the early days were not always fun. He says a lot of people thought badly of him for posting his videos online. Yet _ didn't put him off.\"I kept working hard. \"And the hits on his videos kept coming.\nAustin's achievement and spirit make him a perfect fit for the message of We Day. After all, Free the Children, the creator of the event, was founded to \"enable youth to make changes.\" Even Austin's unusual rise by way of the Internet fits with the way Free The children works and raises money.\nBecause of Austin, his four million followers will learn about Free the Children.
