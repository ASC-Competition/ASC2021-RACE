Throughout spring and fall, dogwoods, maples, redbuds, and many varieties of wildflowers color the forest. This park is also home to many small mammals and birds.

Along the banks of tile river, birdwatchers will spot Canada geese and wood ducks all year round\nFishing\nThe Patapsco River meanders through the park and is a popular attraction for anglers  . The Department of Natural Resources' Fisheries Service assigns the river as a put-and-take fishery  with adult rainbow and brown trout in spring and fall.
