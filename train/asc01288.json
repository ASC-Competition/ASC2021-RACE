  "article": "According to legend, the Bridge of Sighs in Venice, Italy, which connects the Palazzo Ducale to an ancient prison, got its name because the walk across it gave prisoners on their way to jail a final chance to appreciate the beauty of the city.\nThe view from the bridge today, however, is more likely to be of a giant billboard selling Bulgari or Coca - cola. Beyond the billboards, monuments are being restored. The money comes from advertising profits.\nBut when the Coke billboards went up this summer on buildings near the Piazza San Marco, which is at the historic heart of Venice, there was a public debate.\n\"We can't commercialize everything,\" said Alessandra Mottola Molfino, a Venetian. \"The lesson that goes out is that a price is for everything.\"\n\"We couldn't stay quiet,\" said Maria Camilla Bianchini d'Alberigo, president of a heritage protection association. \"Too much is too much.\"\nThere needed to be rules, she added, rules that prevent the advertising billboards clashing   with the monuments of the city.\nCity of officials, however, argue that without these ads, the city could not afford to maintain its heritage. Many have been damaged by centuries of wear and are even a threat to public safety.\n\"I can't turn down the image of bottle when there are pieces of the Palazzo Ducale falling to the ground,\" said Renata Codello, a Cultrue Ministry official.\nThe Culture Minister has a budget of about $ 47 million (315 million yuan) for restoration of monuments, but Italy has a rich architectural heritage, and funds are always tight.Of that amount,\n$ 1.8 million was given to the entire Vector region,  which includes Venice.\nTwo years ago, the city signed an agreement with the Dotter Group, a company responsible for the restoration of the Bridge of Sighs and the Palazzo Ducale.It allows it to sell ad space.\nBut there is a condition in the agreement: The ads should not offend public taste,\nIn August, Venice banned US actress Julianne Moore's Bulgrari ad from a billboard in the Piazza San Marco.\nThe photo shows a naked Moore covered with lion cubs, handbags and jewelry, Mayor Giorgio Orsoni called the image too racy   and unsuitable for the Piazza San Marco.\n\"I take account of the fact that Venice is part of the real world... but we cannot accept these Hollywood-style images.There arc intelligent sponsors, and we need to come up with advertising that suits Venice, not Times Square,\" he said in a speech.",
