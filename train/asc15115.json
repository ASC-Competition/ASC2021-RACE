  "article": "It was August 2nd,1927.The news had spread fast.A man named Ralph Peer was coming to the city of Bristol.He wanted to make recordings of local people singing and playing musical instruments.And he said he would pay fifty dollars for each song recorded.That was a lot of money in those days.Many people came to Bristol that day to play for Mr.Peer.But one group seemed to have just the sound that he was looking for.They were a man named A.P.Carter,his wife Sara,and her cousin Maybelle.They called themselves the Carter Family.\nTheir first recordings were sent to radio stations throughout the United States.Many listeners were surprised at what they heard.Instead of classical or jazz songs that radio stations usually played,a new sound was born.The Carter Family sounded different.They did not sound as if they had taken music lessons.But it did not matter.The people in poor rural areas thought they sounded just like their neighbors.\nThe Carters sang songs about living in the mountains of Virginia,Tennessee,and North Carolina.They sang about the love of a young man for a special girl.They sang about the beauty of nature.They sang about death and sadness.And they sang religious songs that told of the hope for a better life after death.\nA.P.Carter sang in the group and also searched for new songs.He often traveled long distances to small towns in the southeastern United States.He wanted to hear the songs that local people sang in their communities.He wrote down the words but kept the music in his memory.When he returned home,he helped Sara and Maybelle fit them to the Carter Family musical style.\nThe Carter Family soon became famous.They recorded more songs.They traveled to many cities and towns in the eastern United States to perform.Thousands of people heard them sing and bought their recordings.Some people estimate that within three years,the Carter Family sold three hundred thousand recordings.",
