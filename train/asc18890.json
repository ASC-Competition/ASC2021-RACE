In the center  of the garden, there is a pool. The fish are swimming in it. They look very happy and free.\nThere are two teaching buildings around the garden. There are 18 classrooms in it. And there are also many other rooms in it -- music room, reading room, language lab and library.  There are all kinds of books in the library, such as storybooks, cartoon books and magazines.
