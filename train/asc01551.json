  "article": "Mouse potatoes joined couch potatoes (who spend much time watching TV on the couch), google officially became a verb and drama queens (extremely emotional persons) finally found the attention when they crossed over from popular culture to mainstream English language.\nThe mouse potato, the himbo (attractive, empty-headed man) and drama queen were among 100 new words added to the 2006 update of America's best-selling dictionary, the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary<<>> . The Internet search engine Google also found its way into the dictionary for the first time as a verb, meaning to find information quickly on the worldwide web.\nNew words and phrases from the fields of science, technology, pop culture and industry are chosen each year by Merriam-Webster's team of editors after months of looking through books, magazines and even food labels. \"They are not tracking spoken language. They are looking for evidence that words have been used in the written English language,\" said Arthur Bicknell, senior editor of Merriam-Webster.\nOther words first coming into the dictionary this year were soul patch (a small growth of beard under a man's lower lip), unibrow (two eyebrows joining together) and supersize - the fast food industry phrase for extra large meals.\nThe technology world contributed ringtones (changeable incoming cellphone call signals) and spyware (software installed in a computer to track a user's activities) while biodiesel   and avian influenza  came from the world of science.\nAmerica's first dictionary - Noah Webster's A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language - was published 200 years ago and also introduced some fresh words that have now become familiar. Those \"new\" words in 1806 included slang, surf, psychology, naturally and Americanize.",
