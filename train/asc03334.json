  "article": "Doctor Manette had suddenly disappeared. Everything was done to discover some trace of him, but in vain. The loss of her husband caused his wife such pain that she decided to bring up her little daughter, Lucie, in ignorance of her father's fate, and when in two years she died she left little Lucie under the guardianship of Mr. Lorry.\nAfter eighteen years, strange news concerning the doctor had just come from Paris. Mr. Lorry,\ntold Lucie, \"your father has been found. He is alive, greatly changed, but alive. He has been taken to the house of a former servant in Paris, and we are going there.\"\nOn arrival, the banker and Lucie were taken to an attic, where a haggard , white-haired man sat on a low bench, making shoes. He was sheltered by a man by the name of Defarge who, with his wife, kept a wine-shop in the district of St. Antoine.\nCharles Darnay was of noble birth; but his ancestors had for many years so cruelly oppressed  the French peasants that the name of Evremonde was hated and looked down upon. Unlike them in character, this last descendant  of his race had given up his name and wealth and had come to England as a private gentleman, eager to begin a new life. Sydney Carton was a young English lawyer. _ soon became frequent visitors at the small house in Soho Square, the home of Doctor Manette and his daughter. Through Lucie's care and devotion, the doctor had almost completely recovered from the effects of his long imprisonment, and it was only in times of strong excitement that any trace of his past foolish behaviors could be discovered. The sweet face of Lucie Manette soon won the hearts of both the young men, but it was Darnay to whom she gave her love. They married.\nThe French Revolution had actually begun and in 1792 Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay landed in Paris, the former to protect the French branch of Tellson & Co. and the latter to help an old family servant -Gabelle-who had begged his help. Not until they had set foot in Paris did they realize what a caldron of fury   they had been involved in. Mr. Lorry, on account of his business relations, was allowed his freedom, but Darnay was hurried at once to the prison of La Force, there to wait for his trial. The reason given for this outrage  was the new law for the arrest of all returning French emigrants , but the true cause was that he had been recognized as Charles Evremonde. Doctor Manette, going to France with Lucie, gained a promise that Darnay's life should be spared.\nAt last came the terrible year of the Reign of Terror. The sympathy which at first had been given to Doctor Manette had become weakened through the influence of Mrs. Defarge. Also, there had been found in the ruins of the Bastille a paper which contained Doctor Manette's account of his imprisonment, and pronouncing a curse upon the House of Evremonde and their descendants, who were responsible for his eighteen years of misery. Charles Darnay's fate was sealed. \"Death within twenty-four hours.\"\nTo Sydney Carton, who had followed his friends to Paris, came an inspiration. He once promised Lucie that he would die to save a life she loved. He managed to gain admission to the prison; Darnay was removed unconscious from the cell, and Carton sat down to wait for his fate.\nAlong the Paris streets six tumbrels were carrying the day's wine to La Guillotine. In the third car sat a young man with his hands tied. As the cries from the street arose against him, they only move him to a quiet smile as he shook more loosely his hair about his face.\nCrash! A head is held up. The third cart came up, and the supposed Evremonde came down. His lips move, forming the words, \"a life you love.\"",
