The hot weather, which officials say would continue over northern, north-western and central India in the next 48 hours, also may have some impact on wheat production, exporters and flour-mill associations said.\nNew Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 43.7oC on Saturday, indicating a hot summer in the next two months in the nation's capital and other parts of northern and eastern India. The highest temperature in the past 24 hours was 47oC at Ganganagar city, in Rajasthan state. Summer temperatures have been 4oC-6oC above normal over most parts of northern and central India since March, weather officials said.\nIn the eastern state of Orissa, authorities have decided to shut down schools from next Tuesday, advancing the annual summer holiday.

Other deaths were reported from northern state of Uttar Pradesh and central Madhya Pradesh states.\nIndia is expected to produce about 82 million tons of wheat in 2009-2010, but there could be a shortage of 1-1.5 million tons due to the heatwave, said Veena Sharma, Secretary General of the Roller Flour Millers Federation of India. \"Most of the harvesting is over, but there definitely will be a slight shortage of 1-1.5 million tons due to the extreme weather conditions,\" she told Reuters.\nIndia is relying on an abundant wheat crop to make up for a 14.2% drop in rice output, the major summer-sown food grain, _ by the worst monsoon  in 37 years last year.
