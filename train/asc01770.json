  "article": "A businessman had two sons. While he gave the younger son a lot of love and gifts, he neglected   the elder son. It was completely puzzling   and no one knew why.\nWhen the boys grew up, they were asked to manage the father's business. The elder son was absorbed in the business. From morning till late in the evening, he was busy working. Within a few years, he ran the business very well and even expanded   it.\nWhat about the younger son? He didn't have much to do except have a good time. But the father believed that his favorite son would be a success. If the elder son could be a successful businessman, surely the younger one, with a higher education, would do much better.\nA few years later, the results of his decision became clear. Uninterested in business, the younger son continued spending his time enjoying himself. And he went out of business. But the elder son's far smaller share   of business had expanded and he had proved himself to be a good decision maker.\nAshamed at the turn of events, the father met the elder son and was angry with the younger one. The elder son, who was listening to all this quietly, suddenly said he wanted to set up an independent business and live on his own.\n\"Why?\" asked the father.\n\"I blame   one person for the way my brother has turned out, and it's not him. You can't blame children for the faults   of their parents, can you?\" asked the elder son.",
