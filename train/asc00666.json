  "article": "Horror seized the heart of the World War I soldier as he saw his life-long friend fall in the battle. Caught in a trench with continuous gunfire whizzing over his head, the soldier asked his commander if he might go out into the \"No Man's Land\" between the trenches to bring his fallen comrade back.\n\"You can go,\" said the commander, \"but I don't think it will be worth it. Your friend is probably dead and you may throw your own life away.\" The commander's words didn't matter, and the soldier went anyway.\nTo one's surprise, he managed to reach his friend, raised him onto his shoulder, and brought him back to their company's trench. As the two of them fell in together to the bottom of the trench, the officer checked the wounded soldier, and then looked kindly at his friend. \"I told you it wouldn't be worth it,\" he said. \"Your friend is dead, and your wound is deadly.\" \"It was worth it, though, sir.\" the soldier said. \"How do you mean 'worth it'?\" responded the commander. \"Your friend is dead!\" \"Yes sir.\" the soldier answered. \"But it was worth it because when I got to him, he was still alive, and I had the satisfaction of hearing him say, 'Jim, I knew you'd come.'\"\nMany a time in life, whether a thing is worth doing or not really depends on how you look at it. Take up all your courage and do something your heart tells you to do so that you may not regret not doing it later in life.",
