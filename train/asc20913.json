  "article": "Are you afraid of tests? What will you do to prepare for a test? The following suggestions will be helpful.\nPay attention to what your teacher gives about a coming test. Write down exactly what you will be tested on. Knowing what the test will cover is half done.\nMake a review list that includes important points from class and reading material. Then your studying notes will be in one place. What's more, rewriting the material will help you to remember it.\nDon't cram  !Test preparation begins the first day of class, so keep on doing your reading and homework. Then you just need to review for the test--not learn all the materials. If you wait until the night before to try to learn everything, you will only put more stress   on yourself.\nGet a good night's sleep before the test, but if you can't, don't be awake the whole night. Research shows that getting at least four hours of sleep produces the better test results.\nEat a healthy breakfast to keep your mind sharp  . Avoid sugar, as it will weaken your ability to concentrate  .",
