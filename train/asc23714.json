  "article": "One Saturday, Bob decides to take a drive through the countryside. After a few hours, he sees a dog walking behind a man on the side of the road. As the car comes near them, the dog jumps into the road. Of course, the car hits the poor animal and kills it.\nBob stops his car and walks up to the man. \"I'm very sorry,\" he says. \"Is there anything I can do? Will $10 help?\"\n\"Oh, but...,\" says the man.\n\"I should tell you...\"\n\"Stop! You're right. Maybe $10 isn't enough! That dog was your best friend!\"\nBob then takes $30 out of his pocket and gives it to the man.
