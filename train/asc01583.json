  "article": "Grandpa was a carpenter  . One day he was making some boxes for the clothes his church was sending to an orphanage   in Egypt. On his way home, he reached into his shirt pocket to find his glasses, but they were gone. He drove back to the church, but his search turned out to be fruitless.\nSuddenly, he realized what happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket and fallen into one of the boxes, which he had nailed shut. His new glasses were heading for Africa!\nGrandpa had six children and he had paid twenty dollars for the glasses that morning. \"It's not fair,\" he told God as he drove home. \"I've been very faithful   in giving my time and money to YOUR work.\"\nSeveral months later, the director of the orphanage was on holiday in the United States. He wanted to visit all the churches that helped him in Egypt, so he came to speak on Sunday night at my grandfather's small church in Chicago.\n\"But most of all,\" he said, \"I must thank you for the glasses you sent last year. You see, I had just broken my glasses. Then your boxes arrived. To my surprise, I found a pair of glasses in it and it fit me very well!\"\nThe people listened, happy for the amazing glasses, but thought that the man must have confused their church with another. There were no glasses on their list of items to be sent overseas. Sitting quietly in the back, with tears in his eyes, Grandpa realized that God had played a big trick on him.",
