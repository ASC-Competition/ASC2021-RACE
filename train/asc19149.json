  "article": "One of the most popular items  in the school newspaper is the advice column. No one knows who writes it. The students think their teacher does, but it might be a student using a false name.\nThe students enjoy thinking up problems for the advice column. Here are some of them and their answers.\nAsk the Wise Owl\nQ: I'm always late for school. I try not to be, but I can't help it. Please advise me what to do. Tommy.\nA: You are probably late for school because you don't really like school. My advice to you is to try and enjoy school more, then you won't be late so often.\nQ: I find it difficult to make friends. What do you think I should do? Sara.\nA: I can't advise you until I know more about you. Your problem may be that you are shy. On the other hand, it may be the opposite. You may be too bold . Write and tell me more about yourself.\nQ: I'm always at the bottom(,) of the class. What do you advise me to do? Molly.\nA: I advise you to concentrate on  improving your grades in one subject to start with. If you can do this, you should move a little way up from the bottom. Next, try to improve your grades in another subject, and so on. If you concentrate on one subject at a time, by the end of the year you should be quite a long way up from the bottom in all your classes.",
