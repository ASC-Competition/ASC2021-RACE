  "article": "Some advice :\n(1) Always play in a safe place. A park is a safe place because there are no cars or trucks. But do not talk to anyone you do not know. Never go with a stranger into a motor car.\n(2) Before crossing the road, stop and look both ways. Look left, look right, look left again.\n(3) Keep away from houses or building that are being built or knocked down. Something might fall on your head, or you might cut yourself on broken grass.\n(4) Medicines or pills can be dangerous. Never swallow any pills or medicines you find in the cupboard.\n(5) Wear a life jacket whenever you go out in a boat. Even if you are not in the open sea and the water is not deep, you should have your life jacket on. It's easy to fall out of a boat.\n(6) Do not put your head out of a car, bus or train. Many children have been killed by doing this.",
