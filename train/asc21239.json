  "article": "If you go to an American middle school on Wednesday morning, you will hear kids talking about the American idol show from the night before. Some have called it the most influential show in the history of television.\nAmerican Idol has been extremely successful in the country since 2002. The show was number one for six years! The most popular episode had nearly 38 million _ . But why is the show so popular?\nThe idea of the show is this: everyday people get a chance to show their singing talents to the world and become an \"American Idol\", a famous pop star. Anyone in the country(between the ages of 15 and 28) can have a try--a chance of becoming world famous.\nIn fact, everyday people are the ones who are allowed on the show. If you are a professional singer--you cannot be an American Idol. The winners are regular people from small towns--people who sang in churches or bars but had bigger dreams.\nThe winners of the contest don't get a prize of money. Instead, they get to record an album. Famous stars such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood gained fame  from winning the show. So, it seems the contest really works.\nIt is the idea that anyone can be a super star that draws people to this program. All those hours of practicing in front of the mirror could lead to fame and fortune .Even you could be the next \"American Idol\".\n,.",
