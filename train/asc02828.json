    "What does the author think of Thompson's disappearance?   _"
  ],
  "article": "China produces 58,000 tons of silk each year.Yet one of the most popular silk companies in the world is Jim Thompson, a brand based in Thailand.Thompson, a Delaware native, was trained to be an architect in the mid-1920s, but then joined the United States army during the World War II.He was soon appointed to the CIA and traveled around the world, including Thailand, where he fell in love with the people and their country.\nBeing aware of the potential in silk trade, Thompson returned to Thailand to start his own silk business upon his retirement in 1946. At that time, silk production was becoming weaker due to the slow collection process. To revive the business, in 1947, he took a variety of silk clothes back to New York City to see if the product would be marketable to foreign consumers. He received a positive response, so the Jim Thompson Silk Company was founded in 1948.\nAfter the establishment of his company, silk costumes soon appeared in Broadway plays and popular films such as Ben Hur, and Thai royalty, such as Her Majesty Queen Sirikit, began wearing silk often.Many also think his work contributed greatly to the Thai economy, since the silk industry continues to employ thousands of Thai citizens even today.\nJim Thompson's success is no mystery.However, his disappearance on March 26, 1967 certainly is one.Thompson made a trip to Malaysia to visit friends and one day , ventured into the jungle   on an afternoon walk.He was never seen again despite search parties sent out by the Royal Army Air Corps and British troops.Many have their own theories on his disappearance, but none have been completely confirmed.",
