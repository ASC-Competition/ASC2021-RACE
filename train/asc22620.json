  "article": "Dear Dr. Know\nI am unhappy these days. I am a student in Grade 3 of a middle school. I want to be a policewoman in the future  . But my mother doesn't like the job. She always says it is too dangerous for a girl to work as a policewoman. She thinks girls should work in the office. She hopes that I can work as a doctor. But I really dislike being a doctor. It's terrible for me to work in the hospital. When I talk with her about it, she is often angry. She always thinks she is right. I don't know what to do. Can you help me?\nNancy, Chongqing",
