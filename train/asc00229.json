  "article": "Once when I was facing a decision that involved high risk, I went to a friend. He looked at me for a moment, and then wrote a sentence containing the best advice I've ever had: Be bold and brave -- and mighty   forces will come to your aid.\nThose words made me see clearly that when I had fallen short in the past, it was seldom because I had tried and failed. It was usually because I had let fear of failure stop me from trying at all. On the other hand, whenever I had plunged into deep water, forced by courage or circumstance, I had always been able to swim until I got my feet on the ground again.\nBoldness means a decision to _ . And there is nothing mysterious about the mighty forces. They are potential powers we possess: energy, skill, sound judgment, creative ideas -- even physical strength greater than most of us realize.\nAdmittedly, those mighty forces are spiritual ones. But they are more important than physical ones. A college classmate of mine, Tim, was an excellent football player, even though he weighed much less than the average player. \"In one game I suddenly found myself confronting a huge player, who had nothing but me between him and our goal line,\" said Tim. \"I was so frightened that I closed my eyes and desperately threw myself at that guy like a bullet  -- and stopped him cold.\"\nBoldness -- a willingness to extend yourself to the extreme--is not one that can be acquired overnight. But it can be taught to children and developed in adults. Confidence builds up. Surely, there will be setbacks   and disappointments in life; boldness in itself is no guarantee of success. But the person who tries to do something and fails is a lot better off than the person who tries to do nothing and succeeds.\nSo, always try to live a little bit beyond your abilities--and you'll find your abilities are greater than you ever dreamed.",
