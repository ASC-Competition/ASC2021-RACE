It was time to go to office. He had to stay goodbye to his friend and left. It was raining hard and the streets were wet. He drove too fast to see the red lights . And he couldn't stop his car and hit a car in front of his. An old man got off and called out angrily, \" What are you doing? Do you want to hit me to death ?\"\n\"I'm sorry , sir,\" said Mr. White . \"I didn't find the lights turned red.\" Then he brought out a bottle of wine  and gave it to the old man .21\n\" It's very cold today , sir ,\" said Mr. white . \"Please drink a little , then you'll be warmer.\"\nThe old man drank some wine and became happy. \"I'm feeling much better now.
