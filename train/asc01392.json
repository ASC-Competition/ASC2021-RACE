  "article": "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do; once or twice she had looked into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \"and what is the use of the book,\" thought Alice, \"without pictures and conversations?\"\nSo she was considering in her own mind whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain  would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit- hole under the bush.\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? \"I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?\" she said aloud. \"I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think. I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. 'Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' And what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask.\"\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, when suddenly, thump! thump! Down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.",
