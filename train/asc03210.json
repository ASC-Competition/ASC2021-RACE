  "article": "Almost one in five drivers had dozed off behind the wheel, a shocking news report had showed. Of those who were dozing off, 29% have done so with their cars speeding at 70 miles per hour. The report also found a quarter of men have fallen asleep while driving, making it almost twice as many as women.\nThe Safety on Wheel Report, by Post Office Insurance, also looked at how often tiredness or a lack of concentration caused accidents. Three in ten drivers have experienced an accident, from passing a walker crossing to hitting another vehicle, because of a lack of concentration. Meanwhile, almost half (49%) of UK drivers have driven when they do not concentrate.\nPaul Havenhand, head of insurance at Post Office, said, \" When tiredness strikes, drivers should avoid the roads.\" There is no measurement for tired driving, unlike driving under the influence of alcohol, yet it could result in an equally dangerous accident.\nDrivers are advised to take a 15-minute break from driving every two hours. However, a third (36%) are so eager to reach their destination that they will ignore feelings of tiredness. What's more, almost one in five (18%) will drive for longer than four hours without a break, while 6% carry on for up to 6 hours. Just over a quarter (27%) choose a quick stop to buy a cup of coffee, which is a very popular way for drivers to get rid of tiredness, and only 17% stop to have a rest until they feel energetic again. Mr. Havenhand added, \"Drivers should plan ahead and rest before starting a long journey; besides, they can take regular breaks to _ while on road; in some cases, if they do feel too tired to concentrate on the roads, they could consider an alternative means of transport.\"",
