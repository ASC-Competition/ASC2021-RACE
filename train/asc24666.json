He sits down at a table near the window.\nA waiter comes to him and says, \"Can I help you, sir?\" The man says, \"Yes, please. Can I see the menu  ?\"\n\"Sure,\" answers the waiter. The man wants a good meal and he wants a lot of nice dishes. After a moment, the waiter brings them to him. The man has his meal happily. At this time, a boy comes in and sits down besides the man. He asks the waiter to give him ice cream. The man says, \"I will be back in 5 minutes.\" Then he goes out. After the boy eats his ice cream, he stands up and goes to the door. \"Excuse me, your father doesn't give the money for the meal and your ice cream,\" the waiter stops him and says.\n\"Father? You are wrong. He is not my father. I do not know him. I meet him in the street. He says he'll give me ice cream when I come here at twelve o'clock.\"",
