  "article": "\"Can I see my baby?\" the happy new mother asked. When she saw the baby, she was surprised. The baby was born without ears.\nAs time went by, the baby grew up. There was nothing wrong with his hearing. But some kids laughed at him because he didn't have ears. The baby was very sad, but his parents did nothing but felt sorry for him.\nThe boy's father talked with a doctor. \"Could nothing be done?\" the father asked. \" I believe I could give him a pair of outer ears, if they could be got.\" The doctor answered. So they began to look for a person who would like to give his or her ears.\nTwo years went by. Then the father said, \"You are going to the hospital, son. Mother and I have found someone and it will give the ears you need. But it's a secret, \"said the father. The operation was very successful. Several years later, he got a good job.\nOne day, he told his father \" But I must know who gave so much to me. I want to do something for him or her.\" \"I am sorry, but I can't tell you.\" Said the father.\nThe secret was kept for years, but the day did come. For the boy it was one of the darkest days. He stood with his father over his mother's coffin.\nSlowly, the father raised her thick brown hair to show that his mother had no outer ears. \"Your mother said she was glad that she never let her hair be cut,\" he said, \"and nobody ever thought she was less beautiful, did they?\"",
