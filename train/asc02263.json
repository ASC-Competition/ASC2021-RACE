  "article": "I woke up late and had breakfast in a hurry. I had never been late and didn't want my boss to be unsatisfied. However, it seemed that day wasn't a lucky one for me from the very second I left my flat. The moment I wanted to rush downstairs one of my stiletto heels   broke. I had to return to change my red shoes. I also had to change my purse and other little things that I had tried to match with the shoes. I was sure I would be late for work.\nOn my way to work I had to wait for over half an hour because of an accident. I had no choice but to wait. I phoned my boss and he told me that it was no problem, but he needed me for the meeting with the Japanese clients   that morning.\nFinally, I arrived at the office one hour later. I had to keep calm and be fresh for the meeting to make the clients sure that our plan was the best for their future commercial   project. However, I left the plan I had made the night before at home and was going to present   it to the clients. I was about to get angry when I realized that I had a draft   of it in my office. At last, the presentation came to an end and it turned out to be a success. But I have to say that I had a terrible day, full of incidents  .",
