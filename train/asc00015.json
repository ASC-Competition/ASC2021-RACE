  "article": "Kuala Lumpur is an exciting capital city in Malaysia. Here are the top 4 budget hotels there:\nThe Chinatown Inn (About $30 per night)\nJust a block from the railway station, located in Chinatown's open market. It has clean beds, central air conditioning, hot water for coffee and tea, and a hall with a big screen TV. Wi-Fi is good on the first 4 floors, but a little weak on Floor 5. Many guests like the Chinatown Inn. Their complaint is that the air condition is too cold, so make sure you get a room with a window. You can open it to let some warmth in.\nAncasa Express (About $45 per night).\nThe hotel is above the sky-train station. That makes it convenient to get to other parts of the city. From the station, take the elevator to the 5th floor to reach the hotel lobby  . The rooms are clean and nice. There is a flat screen TV, the strongest Wi-Fi, and a very hot rainfall shower. The guests' complaint is that the cafe is only open for breakfast and dinner, and not 24 hours.\nCentral Hotel (About $35 per night)\nThis hotel is just two blocks from the Central Station, which is the heart of all transportation in the city--buses, trains and sky-trains all meet here. Central is where the airport-link trains will take you to the airport. From Central you can walk 2 blocks to the beautiful Central Hotel, in which rooms are small but nice and clean, and have common Wi-Fi.\nOcean 77 (About $25 per night)\nOn Petaling Street in Chinatown, this brand new hotel is most spotlessly clean. There is a flat screen TV and good Wi-Fi in each room. The location is good, in the heart of the Petaling Street market. No cafe in the hotel, but many nearby on the street.",
