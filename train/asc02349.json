  "article": "Madrid, capital of Spain, is a city with large numbers of historic sites resting in the shadows of modern skyscrapers.\nThis city of over 3, 23 million people, up from 2,88 million in 2000, is proud of Western Europe's royal palace, considered by many to be Madrid's most beautiful building. Inside the Royal Palace 2,800 rooms are decorated with museum-quality furniture and artwork.\nThe internationally loved Prado Museum is the largest and most impressive art gallery in Spain. Opened in 1819, it is filled with works of art that include the world's most comprehensive collection of Spanish paintings.\nSpain is famous for its delicious ham, and there's no better place to try it than at Museo del Jamon, which has five branches around the city. Hanging from the ceiling of each branch are dozens of hams of different types and flavors. Taste them in the bar.\nMadrid had some of Europe's best shopping. For 500 years, shoppers have gathered to a large outdoor flea market   known as the Rastro, where they find everything from antiques   to CDs.\nGet a great view of the city from Teleferico de Madrid. This cable car   takes you on a 2.5kilometer trip 40 meters above the Manzanares River and Casa de Campo park. For a refreshing choice, relax beside the swimming pool on the roof of the Emperador Hotel. Enjoy delicious desserts and drinks while viewing the city, or take a dip in the cool water.\nNo trip to Madrid is complete without seeing a performance of Spain's famous art form, flamenco. Every day, flamenco performers sing, dance or play the guitar in small cafes and grand theaters alike.",
