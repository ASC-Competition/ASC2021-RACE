  "article": "Britain's smallest school was closed down because its only pupil failed to turn up for class, a famous Britain newspaper reported in May.\nThe newspaper said the six-year-old girl's parents were unhappy with a teacher who just got the new job to teach the only pupil.\nThe school had been closed for the last nine months after its former teacher retired and the only other pupil moved on to a secondary school. The new teacher, Ms. Puckey was to start teaching the girl and reopen the school.\nBut the girl's mother is keeping her daughter at home.\n\"I was not pleased with the new teacher,\"the mother said. \"I had told the old teacher as far back as last September that if Ms. Puckey got the job, my child would not be going to school.\"\nThe school lies on an island off the northeast of Scotland. Although there was only one pupil, the school is very good in many ways and has a headmaster, three computers, a television, and an art room as well as a school house with three bedrooms.",
