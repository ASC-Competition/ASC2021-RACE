  "article": "While exciting for many, the holidays are stressful for the thousands of families who are struggling in our community.\nTherefore, our holiday programs coordinate food collections and donations to aid the low-income mothers, children and senior citizens. Those who wish to join the challenge can send financial donations to our office: 1355 Oakman Boulevard, Detroit 48238. Other ways you can get involved are:\nCollect fresh or packaged food or donations for senior citizens. Many schools and business coordinate food drives to support this effort. The donation will be distributed in a massive effort on December 12 at the Rashid Ground. Call 313 494 4401.\nAdopt a senior citizen. We will randomly select senior citizens and provide their contact information for donors. We encourage donors to provide fresh food for a holiday meal, and small gifts, if possible. Donors are responsible for purchasing and distributing the gifts and food. Call 313 494 4424.\nAdopt a family. Donors can request the names and addresses of families that are enrolled in our food program to provide gifts and food for the holiday season. They can indicate the size of the family they wish to adopt. All families will be selected randomly. Call 313 494 4413.\nParticipate in our Special Holiday Delivery. Different from past years, when delivery took place at the Gathering Center, volunteers are now expected to meet at the Campus Hall on December 12 to pick up boxes of food and deliver them to senior citizens. Contact Volunteer Outreach Department at 313 494 4270 to sign up for this special event.",
