  "article": "Hi, my name is Amy. I am a Grade 7 student, and I would like to tell you something about my class and myself.\nThere are ten classes in Grade 7.In each class, there are about forty students. I think that my class, Class 4 is the best .That is because all the students in my class work very hard and the teachers are all very nice to the students. But I am not one of the best students in the class.\nI love reading, and I am very good at Chinese and English. I don't find Maths very interesting, so I am not good at it. I want to work hard at it. My teacher, classmates and my parents would like to help me with my Maths.",
