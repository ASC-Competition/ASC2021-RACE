  "article": "A city without cars would be very strange, right? But Venice is such a city.\nVenice is in the northeast of Italy. It wasn't built on land, like Beijing or Shanghai, but on more than 110 islands. Seawater is everywhere around the city.\nEven so, travel isn't difficult. The waterways have always been the best ways to get around. There are 117 waterways and more than 400 bridges that can guide you where you want to go.People in Venice move from place to place by boat. They like to enjoy the scenery and cool summer nights while taking boat trips. They can talk to other people as they go along.\nVenice grew out of small islands in saltwater lakes when some Italians escaped from a war more than 1,500 years ago, and built homes there.\nWater makes the city special, but it is also a big problem.\nOnce, people used too much underground water. This made the city get lower little by little. Now the city has gone down by 23 centimeters. Another problem is the rising seawater. The temperature has risen over the years. This has made the ice of the Arctic Ocean   melt  .\nEvery year, high waters hit the city in autumn and winter. When a lot of water comes, more than half of the city is underwater.\nScientists are trying different ways to stop the city from getting even lower.\n,.",
