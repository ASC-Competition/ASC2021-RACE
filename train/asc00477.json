  "article": "The brothers Grimm , Jacob and Wihelm are synonymous with fairytales. The stories they gathered have been read by millions of children in all countries over the last two hundred years. It's difficult to think that any children could not be attracted by a tale like Red Riding Hood ,which never seems to grow old.\nThis year, Dec20 marked the 200thanniversary of publication of the tales. The Brimms collected the stories and gave them to the world because they wanted to show what German culture was about. In their time, Germany was not yet a nation; it was a collection of little states. Like many patriotic intellectuals ,they thought they could help people in German territories  to understand their own traditions.\nQuite a few adult were shocked by brothers Grimm's work. They wrote about a wolf who eats a little girl's grandmother and an awful old woman who wants to put Hansel and Gretel in a stove. In fact, the original Grimm fairy tales are often far more unpleasant, and more adult in theme .There is a lot of cruelty too. In the wedding scene of Snow White ,the stepmother dances in red-hot iron shoes that kills her.\nHowever, other people came along and made these stories more \"suitable\" for children. The modern children's writer Philip Pullman recently published a book of his versions of some Grimm tales. He points out that the Grimms themselves changed the stories, but for the better. They knew how to hold the attention of readers. \"A Grimm tale,\" he says, \"moves with a dreamlike speed from event to event, pausing only to say as much as is needed and no more.\" So, when we read a story from Grimms' collection, we're getting something from old Germany, but our enjoyment is also thanks to the brothers' great storytelling skills.",
