  "article": "Now, it is winter and as you have probably noticed, virus   are everywhere--runny noses, sore throats, nothing quite like the common cold to make you feel so uncomfortable. But experts believe that there is no link between cold weather and catching colds. So why are we particularly easy to catch colds this season?\nInternal Medicine expert, Dr Meenakshi Jain of Max Hospital says, \"One reason could be because people are likely to stay indoors, so the virus can spread easily. Also the virus grows strong and healthy under wet conditions.\"\nThe common cold can be caused by any of up to 250 kinds of virus. The most common group of them is the kind of virus that hits the nose, which is called rhinovirus  . Rhinoviruses cause a third and half of all common colds.\n\"The kind of virus is spread through the nose and respiratory passages , by touch, and by contact with particles  in the air that are created by sneezing or coughing,\" says Dr Jain.\nThere is no way to treat the common cold. However, there are some tips that can help. Wash your hands regularly, so that germs get killed. Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth, which can limit your chances of infection .  Don't share drinking glasses with anyone as this will prevent the spread of the virus. Drink lots of water. Make sure to eat enough fruits to _ your immune system . Get enough sleep and you'll certainly become stronger.",
