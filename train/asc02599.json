  "article": "Nobody likes having to deal with an upset child. If your little one is hurt, scared or sad, your heart breaks for her. If she's mad, it can make you mad. You want to be there for her and comfort her, but the best way to do that will depend mainly on two things: why she's upset and how old she is. Be calm and open-minded when trying to comfort your upset child.\nTry to find out why your child is upset, because that affects how you should respond and what will be most effective in trying to comfort her. Take her aside and sit down to talk on her level, physically and emotionally. Be sure she knows she has your complete attention while she's telling you about the friend who wouldn't share her new toy and so on. Even if you've got 20 other things you need to get done, make yourself take a break and focus on her for a few minutes.\nListen carefully to what your child says, and also pay attention to what she's not saying. If she says she's upset because \"she hates her stupid school\", you must \"choose to accept it\" -- to read between the lines. Maybe she's struggling with her studies, or the teacher scolded  her in front of everybody. Patiently listen and try to _ so you know what kind of problem you're dealing with.\nSometimes just knowing someone hears her pain goes a long way toward comforting an upset child. Don't make excuses or blame others, just let her know her feelings are natural and understandable. Give her permission to feel sad for a little bit or even cry a little, and give her a big hug. Then help her think of ways to get over the hurt and refocus her attention on another activity or friend.",
