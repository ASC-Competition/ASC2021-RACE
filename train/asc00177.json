  "article": "We were driving from Los Angeles to Dallas,running low on gas somewhere in New Mexico and figured we'd see a gas station soon enough to fill up.\nBut that didn't happen and we realized we wouldn't make it to the next town.So my daughter made up a sign that read\"Low on gas.Can u help?\" and held it outside her window in the hopes that a driver in the next lane would notice it and stop.\nThere weren't too many vehicles passing us either at the time.It was a lonely stretch of road and about 3:30 pm on a weekday.A suburban was driving along happily in the neighboring lane ahead of us.We caught up with it in the hopes the driver would notice the sign.After a brief expression of confusion on his face,he seemed to have noticed the sign and slowed down to pull over.We pulled over right behind him.\nHe was friendly and was eager to help us.At first he thought we didn't have enough money to buy gas,so he offered to buy us gas at the next town Roswell that was about 10 miles away![:ZXXK]\nWhen we explained our _ of not having enough gas to get to Roswell,he said his farm was about 1 0 minutes away and they had a gas pump there,so if we could give him 20 minutes,he would head back there,get a can of gas and fill up our tank for us.\nWe could not believe our good fortune ! There not being any cell phone reception for either of us in the area, we had just hoped that whoever stopped to help would be kind enough to call AAA when they got to Roswell and we would just wait it out for them to help us.\nWe were filled with gratefulness for the kindness of strangers such as this person as we waited for him to return.Sure enough,he was back with the can and quickly filled our tank.He refused to take payment for the gas.Tears flowed,as did our endless appreciation.",
