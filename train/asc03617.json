  "article": "My life began similarly to most children but I grew up without knowing what a father or mother was. No one was there to teach me how to tell right from wrong. Because of this, I got into some bad habits and spent seven years as a boy on the street.\nWhen I was 20, I was taken in a rehab clinic  . Inside I met Bill, my counselor  . He taught me a lot of things. The main thing was the gift of giving.\nIt was the night before an important test and I was very nervous. Bill invited me to go out for a walk to relax  me. As we walked and talked, Bill suggested we should go for a coffee. I told him I had no money when I got paid, and I offered to pay him back. He stopped then and looked at me in a serious, but loving way and said he was doing this because he wanted to. Then he said, \"One day when you'll be around someone who will need a coffee, you'll be able to buy it for them. That's how you can pay me back.\"\nI'm a primary school teacher now. My job is simple and I can buy young people coffee now. Bill taught me how to offer help to others.",
