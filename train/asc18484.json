  "article": "Beethoven, a famous musician in the world, was born in Germany in 1770.\nIn his childhood Beethoven didn't have a happy life.His father was a singer. When he was only four, his father began to make him practise hour after hour on different musical instruments . If he did not put his heart into it, his father would beat him or make it hard on him.\nBeethoven loved music and he learned so fast that he was able to go around to give concerts, when he was only a boy of eleven. At the age of seventeen, he won high praise from Mozart, the great musician at that time.\nBeethoven was often poor and ill during his life. After one illness, he suddenly found himself deaf. At that time he was only thirty-one. It was a blow to him indeed.\nBut he still went on working and writing music pieces. To people's surprise, some of his best pieces were written after he lost his hearing.\nIn 1827, leaving more than 300 pieces, the great musician died. But his name is still remembered to this day.",
