  "article": "Dick was a twenty-year-old man. His father was a teacher and taught chemistry in a middle school and his mother worked in a shop. They lived a happy life until his parents died one night when suddenly an earthquake broke out. Luckily his sister took him to see their aunt in the city and they did not stay at home. Everything was destroyed in the earthquake and the two children got into trouble. Thanks to their aunt who was not rich enough, they grew up but they lived a hard life. His sister was so sad that she became a nun  . After he finished middle school, he was introduced to an owner of a hotel and began to work there.\nOne day the young man fell to the ground while he was cleaning a window on the second floor. He was sent to the hospital and the doctor looked him over. One of his legs was broken and he had to be in hospital. He said to the nurse, \"I'm a poor man, madam. Arrange a third-class ward   for me, please.\"\n\"Can't anybody help you?\"\n\"No, madam,\" answered Dick. \"I have only a sister. She's a nun and she's poor, too.\"\n\"I don't think so,\" the nurse said angrily. \"Nuns usually marry God. And God is the richest in the world, you know!\"\n\"Well, then,\" Dick said with a smile. \"Please arrange a first-class ward for me and post the bill   to my brother-in-law.\"",
