  "article": "Zheng Pengyu: Interest is the best teacher. Classrooms that weren't fixed could give students the chance to explore their interests. At the same time, they would be able to learn on their own because they would have to make their own decisions. All in all, the new system would be a good chance to inspire students' passion for studying.\nSun Yao: Despite its benefits, I'm worried about whether the new system would work. Going to different classrooms would take up a big part of our break time and we would have less time to relax after class. Also, not all schools could offer so many diversified classes.\nShi Zhenghan: I support students learning in different classes. It would solve the problem of some students thinking the classes are too easy while some think they are too difficult. Teachers could also teach more effectively. What's more, friendships built while in different classes might be a pleasant surprise.\nZhou Qingqing: In my opinion, studying in different classrooms might affect students' psychological   development. They might find it difficult to develop deep and strong friendships with other students if they had to change classrooms constantly. They would also lose their sense of belonging to a certain class.\nHu Qile: I _ the idea. It would help teachers set up special teaching plans for different classes. For students, making choices by themselves could encourage them to be responsible. Changing classrooms could also help relive the boredom of doing the same dull routine   every day.\nWang Xiaoqian: The new system might help with students' individual development, but I still prefer the current system. Studying in one fixed classroom, students with different academic levels can help each other. Spending your senior middle school years with the same classmates is an unforgettable experience.",
