  "article": "Imagine there is a bank that puts $ 86, 400 in your account each morning. It carries over no _ from day to day. Every evening the bank writes off  the balance that you failed to use during the day. What would you do? Take out every cent, of course!\nEach of us has such a bank. Its name is TIME. Every morning, it puts in 86, 400 seconds. Every evening it writes off, as it is lost. There is no balance or overdraft. If you fail to use the day's savings, the lost is yours. There is no going back. There is no taking from \"tomorrow\". You must make good use of it so as to get more in health, happiness and success!\nThe clock is running. Make the most of today. To realize the value of ONE YEAR, ask a student who failed a grade; To realize the value of ONE MONTH, ask a mother who gave birth to a premature  baby; To realize the value of ONE WEEK, ask the editor of a weekly newspaper; To realize the value of ONE HOUR, ask the lovers who are waiting to meet; To realize the value of ONE MINUTE, ask a person who missed the train; To realize the value of ONE SECOND, ask a person who just avoided an accident.\nMake good use of every moment that you have. Remember that time waits for no one. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why it's called \"The Present\".",
