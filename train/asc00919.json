  "article": "33 Chilean miners were trapped nearly a half-mile underground after the mine accident. They had no real hope that they'd ever be found. Luckily, though, the men had Luis Urzua. They were rescued to safety on October 13, 2010.Urzua, 54, was the shift leader at the time of the disaster, and used all his wisdoms and his leadership talents to help his men stay calm and in control for the 17 terrible days it took for rescuers to make their first contact with them.\nIt was no surprise that Urzua was the last of the 33 miners to leave the mine.\nUrzua --- after shaking hands with rescue workers ---- climbed into a capsule barely wider than a man's shoulders at 9:46 and was hauled up   from a narrow hole drilled through 2,000 feet of rock. He arrived at the top 11 minutes later.\n\"We have done what the entire world was waiting for,\" he told Chilean President Sebastian Pinera immediately after his rescue. \"The 69 days that we fought so hard were not in vain.\" Pinera greeted Urzua, saying \"You have been rescued, coming out last like a good leader... You have no idea how all Chileans share with\nyou your hardships, your hope, and your joy. You are an inspiration.\" With Urzua by his side, the president led the crowd in singing the national anthem.Robinson Marquez once worked with Urzua in a nearby mine. He described Urzua as a calm, professional person and a born leader. \"He is very protective of his men and obviously loves them. He wouldn't have left until all of his men were safely above ground,\" Marquez said.\nUnder Urzua's leadership, the men stretched an emergency food supply meant to last just 48 hours over two and a half weeks, taking tiny sips of milk and bites of fish every other day.He described the difficulties of the first days, saying that it took about three hours for the dust to settle before the men could inspect where tons of collapsed rock sealed off   the main way out. When the rescuers first made contact by drilling a narrow hole into their refuge  , the miners were so excited that everyone wanted to hug the drill hammer.After the collapse, Urzua was the first to speak to Pinera and to urge him not to let him and his men down. \"Don't leave us alone,\" he asked the president, who assured the workers that they would not be abandoned, telling them he would do everything he could to get them back to the surface.",
