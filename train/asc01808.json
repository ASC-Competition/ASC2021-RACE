  "article": "When I was a boy my father told me that he could do anything he wanted to.Dad said that he wanted to be the first to develop color prints in our city, and so he did.\nWhen I was 16,dad looked closely at the violin I played and said that he wanted to make one.He read about violinmaking,and then became a violinmaker at the age of 43.He bought the tools and materials,opened a small store and set Mom up as the shopkeeper,while he worked at a local company.He retired from the company 17 years later and continued to make violins and other instruments.\nDad often guessed why the Stradivarius violins sounded so beautiful.Some experts told him that it was the special varnish that gave the instruments their beautiful sound.Dad argued that chemists could analyze the varnish--if that was the answer.\nOne of Dad's friends asked him which kind of wood was used to make violins.When dad explained that the top was made of spruce ,his friend said that he had all old piece of spruce which dad might be interested in.\nHe worked for the next 12 months making a violin from the wood that his friend had given him.It proved to be an excellent violin and it would become Dad's masterpiece.He believed that the secret of the Stradivarius sound was in the wood itself.\nLater, the instrument was stolen. _ But he kept the music shop until he was 80 years old,selling guitars and violins.\nThe violin has been missing for more than 25 years.Somewhere a musician is playing a late-20th-century violin with an excellent tone.The owner today may never understand why this Ordinary-looking violin sounds so much like Stradivarius.",
