  "article": "The street food stands are very popular in Korea . They take their name from the two kinds of hot foods they sell : Dukbokgi and Odeng .\nDukbokgi is a spicy hot food made of rice cakes and some vegetables . These rice cakes are finger-shaped . They are white , and they are about ten centimeters in length . They are mixed with sliced vegetables in a pan with a spicy red dressing . Fifteen minutes later , they are ready to eat . Odeng is made of ground fish . It comes in many shapes : some are square , others are round , and still others are stick style . You can buy big or small ones . At these food stands , you can also eat Odeng , which has been boiled in a pot . It is served on a long stick so can eat it easily .\nThe food sold at these stands is not expensive , compared to what other foods in Korea cost . Each Dukbokgi and Odeng costs about twenty to fifty cents , depending on the owner .\nEach food stand has its own recipes for its food ; for example , some like to add sugar or other special ingredients in the food . Usually , there is just one owner , but if the food stand is big , there may be two or three owners .\nWhen I was an elementary school student , I used to stop at street food stands every day after school to eat street food because I like it so much .",
