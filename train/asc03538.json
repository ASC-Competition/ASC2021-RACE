  "article": "It was a Friday. As usual, the office became busier and busier. Orders to buy and sell came and went like birds. It was in the stock market, the world of money that Mr.Robert,the stockbroker, worked faster and faster. There was no room in it for the world of human feelings or the world of nature.\nNear lunchtime, everything quieted down.Mr.Robert stood by his desk with his hands full of letters. Suddenly through the open window came a smell of flowers,like the thin breath of spring.Mr.Robert stood still. This was Miss Angelia's smell, her own and only hers.The world of the stock market disappeared. And Miss Angelia was in the next room--only twenty steps away.\n\"I'll do it now,\" said Mr.Robert softly. \"I'll ask her now.Why didn't I do it long ago?\"\nHe ran into her office. She looked up at him with a smile. Her face turned a soft pink.\n\"Miss Angelia,\"he said, hurriedly, \"I only have a moment to talk.I want to say something important to you,Will you be my wife?I haven't had time to show you, but I really do love you.\"\n\"Why ...what are you talking about?\" cried the young lady.She stood up and looked at him strangely. \"Don't you understand?\" Mr. Robert asked quickly. \"I want you to marry me now.\"\nMiss Angelia acted very strangely. At first she seemed surprised. Then she began to cry. But then she smiled through her tears like the sun through rain. She put her arms around his neck. \"But don't you remember, darling?\" she said .\"We were married yesterday evening at 8:00, in the little church around the corner.\"",
