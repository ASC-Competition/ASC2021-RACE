  "article": "Philo Farnsworth is not a name most people know. But his work changed the way we learn, the way we live, and even the way we think. Philo Farnsworth is responsible for one of the 20thcentury: television.\nPhilo Farnsworth was born in America in 1906. He was interested in science and technology at an early age. When he was twelve years old, he built an electric motor for his family's washing machine. When he was fourteen, he was already giving a lot of thought to electrons . As he was driving the family's horse-drawn plowing machine, he noticed the evenly spaced rows of the potato fields. This sight gave him the idea that electrons could scan  an image one row at a time--an idea that was the key to electronic television.\nBy the time he was twenty-one years old, Farnsworth had started his own company and had managed to build the world's first electronic television. It was a very simple device . But after years of hard work, Farnsworth was able to introduce the kind of television we now use.\nFarnsworth was a great inventor, but lived an unhappy life. He had a legal battle with the company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA) over who the real inventor of the TV was. _ , but the government stopped companies from making TVs during the war, so Farnsworth didn't make much money from the invention.\nWhen Farnsworth was young, he imagined television as a convenient way for distant audiences to enjoy lectures by famous professors, or entertainment by the best symphonies  and ballets. When he was older, television became much more popular, but he was very disappointed in the silly programs on TV. He even told his own son, \"There's nothing on it worthwhile, and we're not going to watch it in this household.\"",
