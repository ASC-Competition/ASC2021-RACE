I'm very interested in your private lessons and would like some more information.\nI am a student at Aston College here in Hong Kong studying English, so my language level is already quite good.\nHowever, I feel that I need to improve my listening and speaking skills. This is because I'm planning to study at London University in England next year and I think your lessons will help me to live and study abroad.\nCould you send me some more information about the lessons offered, such as where and when they will be held and how much they cost? Also, I would like to know whether you teach students in groups or one-on-one.\nI would be glad to supply any further information you might need.\nRegards,\nLi Hua",
