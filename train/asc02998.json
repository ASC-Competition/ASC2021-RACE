  "article": "The City Bike program rolled into New York last spring and proved a hit, with nearly 12,000 New Yorkers signing up for annual memberships. Since 2010, over a dozen US cities have introduced bike-share programs.\nThere're plenty of bike stations near parks and other car-free areas. The programs we looked at in major cities work the same way. You buy a 24-hour pass. During the time, you get an unlimited number of 30-minute rides. If you go over your given half-hour ride time, you start paying fees for each following 30-minute period. Here are some of the biggest bike-share program in America.\nMinneapolis: Nice Ride Minnesota\nStation : Minnehaha Ave. & Minnehaha Pkwy\nHow much: $ 6 for a 24-hour pass.\nHow it works: The first 30 minutes are included in the pass; $ 1.50 for the second 30 minutes; $ 4.50 for the third 30 minutes; later $ 6 for every half an hour.\nChicago: Divvy Bikes\nStation : Lakeshore Drive and Monroe St; also Museum Campus\nHow much: $ 7 for a 24-hour pass, with unlimited 30-minute trips.\nHow it works: The first 30 minutes are included in the pass; $ 2 for the second 30 minutes; $ 6 for the third 30 minutes; later $ 8 for every half an hour.\nNew York City: Citi Bike\nStation : Central Park So. & 6thAve; also Broadway & W.57thSt.\nHow much: $ 9.95 for a 24-hour pass.\nHow it works: The first 30 minutes are included in the pass; $ 4 for the second 30 minutes; $ 9 for the third 30 minutes; later $ 12 for every half an hour.\nBoston: Hubway\nStation : Tremont St. & West St.\nHow much: $ 6 for a 24-hour pass.\nHow it works: The first 30 minutes are included in the pass; $ 2 for the second 30 minutes; $ 4 for the third 30 minutes; later $ 8 for every half an hour.\nWe are volunteers.
