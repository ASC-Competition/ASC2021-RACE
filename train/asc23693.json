  "article": "Jim, a young farmer, was once put into prison .\nOne day, he got aletter from his mother. \"I'm so worried about our farm,\"she wrote. \"It'stime to plant potatoes. I can't dig  all the fields by myself.\nJim read the letter and became sad. \"What can I do?\" he thought. Then he had a good idea. He wrote to his mother, \"Don't dig the fields, there's a pot  of money in the earth. Don't plant potatoes until I come home. \"\nSome days later, Jim got another letter from his mother. It said, \"Two days ago, about ten men came to our farm and dug all our fields. I can't understand it. It looks as if they were looking for something. What shall I do?\"\nJim smiled when he read his mother's letter. He wrote a letter to his mother at once. It was very short. Guess what it would say?",
