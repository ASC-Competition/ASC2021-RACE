  "article": "For many years, the school students have to finish some homework during their winter and summer holidays. But with the fast development of the Internet, some students have found a new way to deal with their homework recently. Instead of finishing their homework by themselves, they ask the Internet for help.\nSince most of the holiday homework is the same from school to school, this makes it possible for some people to sell the homework answers on the Internet. Usually one must pay about 50 to 100 yuan for the answers for one subject of the homework. A survey shows that 90% of the students complain their homework is too much and they don't want to do it by themselves.\nTo solve the problem, some schools have stopped using the standard homework and turned  to other forms of homework. As for students, they must remember \"No pains, no gains\". If today they pay for their homework answers, perhaps one day they will pay more for their laziness .",
