  "article": "I was catching a later flight to St. Louis, then on to Minnesota. A couple of seats in front and the aisle over sat a very pretty lady. She smiled back at me, I smiled at her noticing her pretty  dress.\nThe rest of the flight was uneventful, but as I was getting off the plane I noticed her again standing by the prompters seeing what flight she was to take and what gate. I stood beside her looking for my gate, and flight number. I commented to her that I had seen her on the flight and she had on a pretty dress. She said \"Thank you\", I asked what flight she was taking? She said to \"Phoenix\". I looked and she had a two-hour _ , I also had a two and a half hours layover and asked her if she would like to go to the cafeteria for something to eat or drink. She said \"Sure\". We introduced ourselves on the way, and she told me that her name was \"Phyllis\". I laughed and said \"my name is Phyllis also\".\nAs we sat in the booth she began telling me that she had been told she was dying of cancer and had less than 6 months to live. She was on her way to visit her children and grandchildren before she began taking treatment. She then told me that she had never flown before and she had prayed a specific prayer. She was afraid she would get lost at the airport and not be able to find her way to the gate, and didn't know what she was going to do for the two hours she was there. She prayed, that someone would meet her at the gate and stay with her until she left the airport. She then asked me \"Are you an Angel God has sent\"? No, I assured her I was no angel, but did God use me to answer her prayer? Yes.",
