  "article": "Several weeks ago, kidsPost did a story on \"The Art of Video Games\" at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The exhibition has created debate with some people saying that as fun as video games are ,they are not works of art. Other people say that videos games may be a new form of art and that they belong to in museums. We asked readers for their opinions on the topic. Here are a few of the letters we received.\nA video game is like a painting on a screen. In order to make a video game, you have to think of something original to reach the players. This is the point of Art.\n---Mary Pottanat,13\nI believe video games are not a form of art. Art should be a visual  and creative expression of feelings. Although it is arguable that video games are visual ,they do not express feelings in any way.\n---Prannab Kirshnan,12\nHowever exciting video games are, they are not art. Painting is art, but not video games. Art has beauty and culture that no technology could ever compare to. Even though you can create art in some video games, the \" Mona Lisa\" wasn't painted with Nintendo.\n---Caroline Kaplan,10\nArt is a way of communicating ideas to the public in a way that is fun to them. The \"public\", who in this case are kids and adults, are finding these video games from different time periods interesting. Video games would not have been art if it had not been for the kids and adults attracted by \"the art of video games\".\n---Ryan Puthumana,10",
