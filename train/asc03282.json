  "article": "Have you ever been afraid to talk back when you were treated unfairly? Have you ever bought something just because the salesman talked you into it?\nMany people are afraid to assert (,) themselves.Dr.Robert Albert, author of STAND UP, SPEAK OUT and TALK BACK, thinks it is because their self-respect is low.\"There's always a superior  around--a parent, a teacher, a boss who knows better.'' But Albert and other scientists are doing something to help people assert themselves.\nThey offer assertiveness training courses, A.T.for short.In the A.T.course people learn that they have a right to be themselves.They learn to speak out and feel good about doing so.They learn to be confident without hurting other people.\nIn one way, learning to speak out is to get rid of fear.A group taking an A.T.course will help the _ person to lose his fear.But A.T.uses an even stronger motive to share the need.The timid person speaks out in the group because he wants to tell how he feels.\nWhether or not you speak up for yourself depends on your self-respect.If your face is more important than you, you may feel less of a person.You start to doubt your answers to problems.However, once you get to feel good about yourself, you can learn to speak out.",
