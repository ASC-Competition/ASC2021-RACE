  "article": "I didn't think I had a passion . I would sit in front of the TV all day, thinking about nothing but the next show. It was not long ago that I first learned how important having a passion is to life.\nThat day I went with my mum to drive my sister to the gym. I was bored. Then, as my mum stopped at a red light, someone on the side of the road caught my eye . It was a man dressed in rags  . He was homeless. That didn't interest me, for I had seen many like him before.\nBut in some ways he was different. This man was not sitting down with a sad expression . He had a radio in his hand and was dancing happily to the music. The radio seemed to be the most precious thing he had.\n\"Mum, why does that man have a radio even thought  he's homeless?\" I asked.\n\"He bought it,\" she replied. I was still unable to understand.\n\"But if he's homeless, why doesn't he use the money to buy food or clothes? He wasted it on something he doesn't need.\"\n\"Well, Sarah, sometimes food and clothes aren't the most important things. We need happiness, too.\"\nThe man must care too much about music to buy a radio instead of food clothes. I soon realized that happiness is the key to life. Without it, there's nothing to look forward to.\nSince then I've never gone a day without thinking of what's truly important. A home, a meal, clothes--these things are only part of the picture. What's often forgotten is that we all need a pleasure, a light in a dark day. We all need a passion.",
