  "article": "Shark on the bait   !\" shouted Andre Harman, pointing to a spot a few yards behind the outboard motors. His voice gave no indication of panic, but the crew suddenly became tense and fixed their eyes on the water. Slowly, smoothly, Andre drew in the bait.The shark followed. No one asked what kind of shark it was. Everything about it, from its color to its shape, tells that it was a great white shark.\nAndre lifted the bait aboard. Placing himself between the two motors, he dropped his right hand into the water just as the great head reached the first motor. \"My goodness Andre!\" I said. His hand seized the big nose, moving it away from the tube of the motor, guiding the shark's head up as it rose out of the water. Andre's hand held the nose, touching it gently. No one spoke. No one breathed. The moment seemed endless. In fact,  it lasted less than five seconds before Andre pulled his hand back.\nStill nobody spoke. Then Andre smiled and said:  \"The first time was an accident. I was just trying to move the shark away from the motor. Sharks are attracted to motors by their electrical signals and have a habit of biting them to see if they are eatable. \" Andre has worked with great white sharks for years. \"My hand landed on its nose, and it sort of paused, so I kept it there, and when I did let go, the shark bit and bit as if it was searching for whatever it was that had attracted it.\"\nNearly every encounter   we had had with the great whites had been totally illogical. The more we learned,  the more we realized how little was really known about them in the past years. Back then, it was generally accepted that great whites ate people by choice. Now we know that almost every attack on a human is an accident in which the shark mistakes a human for its normal food. Back then, we thought that once a great white smelt blood, it would lead to death. Now we know that nearly three-quarters of bite victims survive, perhaps because the shark recognizes that is has made a mistake and doesn't return for a second bite.",
