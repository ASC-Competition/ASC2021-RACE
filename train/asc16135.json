  "article": "Money Matters for Students\nGETTING A GRANT \nWho pays?\nThe local education authority (LEA) for the area in which the student is living.\nWho can get this money?\nAnyone who gets a place on a first degree course,although a student who has already attended a course of advanced further education may not.Students must also have been resident in the UK for at least three years,which can exclude   some students from overseas. SPECIAL CASES\nIf a student has worked before going to college:\nA student who is 26 or more before the course starts and who has worked for at least three of the previous six years will get extra money--PS 155 a year if 26,increasing to a maximum of PS 615 at 29 or more.\nIf a student is handicapped:\nLEAs will give up to PS 500 to help meet extra expenses--such as buying a tape recorder for a blind student,extra heating or special food.\nBanking:\nMost of the big banks offer special services to students who open accounts (in the hope that they will stay with the bank when they become rich officials).A student won't usually have to pay bank charges as long as the account stays in credit.Some banks allow students to overdraw by PS 100 or so,and still don't make charges (though they  do charge interest).",
