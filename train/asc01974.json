  "article": "Florida is celebrating a big anniversary this year. Five hundred years ago, on April 2, 1513, Spanish explorer Juan Ponce arrived on the east coast of what is now Florida. Native Americans had been living there for centuries, but Ponce was the first European to set foot in what would become the United States.\nAccording to legend, Ponce may have landed in Florida by mistake. He is said to have been looking for an island called Bimini and its Fountain  of Youth. The magical fountain could supposedly make old people young again. Instead, Ponce landed on Florida and claimed it for Spain. He named it La Florida, or \"flowery place\".\nPonce explored more of Florida's coasts over the next few months. He later returned to Spain but went back to Florida in 1521 to attempt to set up a colony. However, native Americans attacked him and his friends, and Ponce was killed. It wasn't until 1565 that Spain set up a successful colony at St. Augustine on Florida's east coast. It is the oldest European settlement in the U.S.\nFlorida didn't belong to the U.S. until Spain lost control. It was admitted to the U.S. as the 27thstate in 1845.\nToday, Florida has one of the fastest-growing populations of any state. More than 19 million people call it home.\nIt's also popular with tourists. Last year, 89 million people visited the Sunshine State. These days, most visitors come in search of fun in the sun on its sandy beaches and its theme parks, such as Disney World and Sea World.",
