  "article": "About the year 1900,a small,darkhaired hot boy named Charlie Chaplin was often seen waiting outside the back entrance of London Theatre.He looked thin and hungry.He was hoping to get work in show business.He could sing and dance;above all,he knew how to make people laugh.But he couldn't get work and so he wandered about the city streets.Sometimes he was sent away to a home for children who had no parents.\nBut twenty years later this name Chaplin became the greatest,bestknown,and bestloved comedian in the world.Any visitor to the cinema must have seen some of Chaplin's filmstrips  .People everywhere have sat and laughed at them until the tears ran down their faces.Even people who don't understand English can enjoy Chaplin's films though most of them are silent.It isn't what he says that makes people laugh.His comedy doesn't depend upon words and languages.It depends upon little actions which mean the same thing to people all over the world.Acting out,without words,common human situations play an important part in the dances and plays of many countries.It's a kind of world language.\nChaplin lived most of his life in America and died in Switzerland on Christmas Day,1977,at the age of eightyeight.The world was astonished at the news of the death and burst into sadness.",
