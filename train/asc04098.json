  "article": "What will man be like in the future--in 5,000 or even 50,000 years from now? We can only make a guess, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, for man is slowly changing all the time.\nLet us take an obvious example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average, men are about three inches taller, so we may assume   that man will continue to grow taller. Again, as time goes on, we shall have to use our brains more and more. This is likely to bring about a physical change to the head, in particular, the forehead will grow larger.\nNowadays our eyes are in constant use. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a very long period of time it is likely that man's eyes will grow stronger.\nOn the other hand, we are likely to make less use of our arms and legs, which, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great deal in modern life.\nBut what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer.\nPerhaps all these give the impression that in the future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at! This may well be true. All the same, in spite of all these changes, future man will still have a lot in common with us.",
