  "article": "For pet owners, the hundreds of pet food recalls taking place each year has raised a lot of alarm. \"Most people are caring pet owners, and they want to do what helps protect their pet,\" explains Will Post, founder and CEO, Hound & Gatos Pet Foods Corporation. \"Yet the problem is that most are not sure what that means and how to go about it. The more they learn about pet food, the better able they will be to make an informed decision that will keep their pet healthier and safer.\"\nHere are several tips that consumers may want to keep in mind when it comes to choosing a pet food that will help reduce the risks.\nGet to know the company. Most people may know a company name simply because they spend millions on advertising. But that doesn't mean they know much about the company or their morals. Research companies to find one that offers high standards, quality products, and great customer service.\nAsk questions. Don't be afraid to get in touch with a pet food company and ask them where something was made, where ingredients  came from, or any other questions. They should have no problem answering questions about their products, or with being able to provide proof of their quality standards.\nRead reviews. Do some searches to read some reviews about various brands of pet food. Keep in mind that some reviews can be one-sided and even planted by the company itself, so look for fair third-party sources giving the review.\nInvestigate  ingredients. The source of ingredients is of major concern when it comes to reducing the risks of pet food recalls and keeping pets healthy. Read the labels and ask questions to determine where the ingredients are coming from.\nUnderstand pet foods. Cat and dog food should contain 100 percent protein, which will supply them with the nutrients their bodies require. The problem with many commercial pet foods is that it is full of numerous fillers, such as cheap fillers and grains.",
