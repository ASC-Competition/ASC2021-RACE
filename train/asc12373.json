  "article": "My father was Chief engineer of merchant ship, which was sunk in Word War II. The book Night of the U-boats told the story.\nMemories\nIn September, 1940, my mother, sister and I went to Swansea, where my father's ship was getting ready to sail. We brought him a family photograph to be kept with him at all times and keep him safe.\nThen I remember my mother lying face down, sobbing. She had heard from a friend that the ship had been sunk by a torpedo  .\nI can remember the arrival of the telegram  , which in those days always brought had news. My grandmother opened it. It read, \"Safe, Love Ted.\"\nMy most vivid memory is being woken and brought down to sit on my father's knee, his arm in a bandage.\nHe was judged unfit to return to sea and took a shore job in Glasgow for the rest of the war. For as long as I can remember, he had a weak heart. Mother said _ was caused by the torpedoes. He said it was because of the cigarettes. Whichever, he died suddenly in his early 50s.\nTen years later I read Night of the U-boats and was able to complete the story.\nTorpedo\nOne torpedo struck the ship. Father was in the engine room, where the third engineer was killed. He shut down the engines to slow the ship making it easier for it to be abandoned.\nBy the time he got on deck   he was alone. Every lifeboat was gone except one which had stuck fast. When he tried to cut it free, it swung against the ship, injuring his hand and arm. He had no choice but to jump -- still with the photograph in his pocket.\nThree days later, he and other survivors were safe in Glasgow. All 23 with him signed the back of the photograph.\nA Toast\nIn my room is the book and the photograph. Often, glass in hand, I have wondered how I would have dealt with an explosion, a sinking ship, a jump into a vast ocean and a wait for rescue? Lest we forget, I have some more whisky and toast the heroes of the war.",
