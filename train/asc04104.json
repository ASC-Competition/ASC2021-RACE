  "article": "A survey has shown that what you do on a plane can be determined by which nationality is listed on your passport.\nAccording to the results of an international passenger survey, Australians are the biggest drinkers on board with 36 percent choosing to down the hatch, compared to 35 percent of Americans and 33 percent of Brits.\nThe Airline Passenger Experience Association(APEX) spoke to around 1,500 people, aged 18 and older, who have travelled by plane at least once during the last three months and were living in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, China, Singapore, Australia and Brazil.\nThe results found Chinese travelers are most likely to nod off once the seat-belt sign switches off. They are also the first to take out their credit card for some in-flight shopping and the biggest fans of gaming. Americans on the other hand like to use their time in the air more productively---- when not drinking---- choosing to work while flying at 35,000 feet.\nMeanwhile, Brits and Germans are the best at making chat with random strangers----spending 50 percent more time than any other nationality. Comparatively, Brazilians conduct their conversations online via email, messaging apps or social media.\nDespite plane food having a bad reputation, seven out of ten interviewees said they were happy to eat up on the selection of in-flight snacks and meals. In-flight magazines were also popular with four out of five passengers.\nThe international flyers did however express their desire for better in-flight entertainment. \"The industry has greatly improved the comfort, entertainment and onboard service, and passengers are accepting those improvements\" said Russell Lemieux, APEX executive director. \"At the same time, passengers are demanding more from their air travel experiences which will drive more improvements touching all aspects of the journey. \" he added.",
