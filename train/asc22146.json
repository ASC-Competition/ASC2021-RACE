And as soon as he gets up in the morning, he can find some cakes on the table in his bedroom.\nOne morning, before Jim got up, his grandma took some cakes to his bedroom. She saw Jim crying in bed.\n\"What's the matter, dear?\" his grandma asked in a hurry.\n\"I've a bad toothache,\" said Jim.\nSo his grandma had to take him to the dentist's.
