  "article": "You must have a favorite line or _ you repeat often in your conversations. Studies say that pet phrases can reflect our changing society and reveal information about a person's personality. Here are some of the most popular pet phrases among young people.\n---nuts\nI love the word and use it whenever I think a person is stupid, or a behavior is crazy. I learned the term from one of my classmates. Once, we saw two high school girls wearing miniskirts on a very cold winter day and my classmate called the two girls \"nuts\". I don't think the word reflects my personality. I use it because it sounds cool.\nDiao Yujie, 22, computer science major at Nanjing University.\n---stunning\nI use this word very often. Once, my classmates and I were discussing how amusing QQ is. One guy suddenly burst out, \"I have MSN too\". This comment had no relation with the topic we were discussing. I used this word and everybody laughed. I think it is a fantastic word that can change awkwardness to amusement.\nMu Li, 20, journalism major at Beijing Normal University.\n---I'm giddy!\nI use this word a lot---more often than my classmates. It has became a symbol of me, as my friends sometimes refer to me as the guy who often says the word. I am a person who wants to be different and this word gives me that feeling.\nChen Zhou, 21, Nanjing University.\n---stunning\nI only use this word with my friends. My parents don't understand it. The word, which is only used among people of my age, is intimate. I think it stands for being young and energetic. And I want to be young forever, so I like the word.\nChen Jianjun, 23, senior at Nanjing University.",
