  "article": "In England, some food companies across the whole country have been told to carry out urgent   tests on all beef products. Do you know why? That's because some food companies used horsemeat to make beef products.\nThere are some examples about the horsemeat matter. In January, 2013, in a number of UK supermarkets, frozen hamburgers were found to have _ of horsemeat in them. Some frozen beef products made by food company FINDUS were found to contain horsemeat. All of the beef products made by this company have been removed from sale.\nThe government said that there's nothing to suggest any health risk from the products. Food minister David Heath said people should not throw away frozen meat products and carry on eating meat. The government will tell people not to eat meat if the meat is not safe.\nFood safety has been an important matter all over the world. More and more countries plan to take some useful measures to ensure the safety of food.\n,.",
