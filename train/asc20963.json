  "article": "In my second year of high school, the class was scheduled to run the mile. when the coach yelled, \"Ready. Set. Go!\", I rushed out like an airplane, faster than anyone else for the first 20 feet. I made up my mind to finish first. As we came around the first of four laps, there were students all over the track   . By the end of the second lap, many of the students had already stopped. They had given up and were on the ground breathing heavily. As I started the third lap, only a few of my classmates were on the track. By the time I hit the fourth lap, I was alone. Then it hit me that nobody had given up. Instead, everyone had already finished. As I ran that last lap, I cried. And 12 minutes, 42 seconds after starting, I crossed the finishing line. I fell to the ground. I was very upset.\nSuddenly my coach ran up to me and picked me up, yelling, \"You did it. Mark! You finished, son. You finished\" He looked at me straight in the eyes, waving a piece of paper in his hand. It was my goal ( ) for the day which I had forgotten. I had given it to him before class.  He read it aloud to everyone. It simply said, \"I, Mark Brown, will finish the mile run tomorrow, come what may.\" My heart lifted. My tears went away, and I had a smile on my face as if I had eaten a banana. My classmates clapped. It was then I realized winning isn't always finishing first. Sometimes winning is just finishing.",
