I am not talking about your friends and family , but others who have no importance in your reality - like your social peers and others like them . They are unimportant to your life , and yet you secretly struggle for approval at the cost of your own . Remember , your opinion is king .\nStart by being your true self . Allowing your true self to appear and connect with people on a more real level helps them in turn do the same with you . There is openness and honesty in the interaction . At the end of the day this is what we all want - the joy of true and meaningful connections .\nNext , evaluate your decisions . Are they representing who you are or are they the result of other people's opinion ? Practice your ability not to be affected by pressure and learn to take nothing personally . When we are bothered by outer criticisms , it influences and changes our behavior . Don't look to others for guidance on how to behave . Don't look for approval . If you don't need approval , you won't have a reason to try to impress people or be impressed by them .\nAnd finally , be real in EVERY situation . As you express your real self , others will think highly of you and the few who don't - don't matter anyway . Be willing to be judged , and then not take it to heart . If all this is a bit scary , then start small . Rather than not caring at all what others think , start by just caring a little less . No one outside your inner circle should get a vote or pass judgment or have influence on how you live your life .",
