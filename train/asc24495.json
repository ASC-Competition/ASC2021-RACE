  "article": "Judy had very bad luck yesterday. In the morning, she came to school late, because her alarm clock didn't _ . Usually she goes to school at 7:20 am. But yesterday, it was already 8:00 am when she got up. The teacher was angry  and asked her to stay in the classroom after school. At 5:00 pm, it was time for students to go home. But Judy couldn't. She stayed until  5:30 pm. When she just went out of the classroom, it began to rain. She didn't have an umbrella. On her way home, she fell off  her bicycle. When she got home, she was wet all through.",
