You have to cross a bridge and then turn to the right. When you see a post office, turn left. You can see a shop between a bank and a school on your right.\"\n\"Is it far?\"\n\"No, it is not far. You can go there on foot.\"\n\"Is the bridge long?\"\n\"Yes, it's about thirty metres.\"\nThe woman thanks him and goes towards(, ) the bridge. Suddenly she hears someone running after her.\"Stop!\" Mr Smith shouts.\"I'm sorry. I just remember the bridge is forty metres long.
