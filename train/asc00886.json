  "article": "Why is setting goals important? Because goals can help you do, be, and experience everything you want in life.Instead of just letting life happen to you, goals allow yourself to make your life happen.\nSuccessful and happy people have a vision of how their life should be and they set lots of goals(both short-term and long-range)to help them reach their vision.By setting goals you are taking control of your life.It's like having a map to show you where you want to go.Think of it in this way.There are two drivers.One has a destination in mind(her goal) which is laid out for her on a map.She can drive straight there without any wasted time or wrong turns.The other driver has no goal or destination or map.She starts off at the same time from the same place as the first driver.But she drivers aimlessly around, never getting anywhere , just using up gas and oil.Which driver do you want to be?\nWinners in life set goals and follow through on them.They decide what they want in life and then get there by making plans and setting goals.Unsuccessful people just let life happen by accident.Goals aren't difficult to set, and they aren't difficult to reach.It's up to you to find out what your goals,ideals and visions really are.You are the one who must decide what to pursue and in what direction to aim your life.\nResearch tells us that when we write a goal down we are more likely to achieve it.Written goals can be reviewed regularly, and have more power.Like a contract   with yourself, they are harder to neglect or forget.\nAlso when you write your goals in a particular way you are able to make yourself continuously aware of situations that will bring you nearer to your goals.",
