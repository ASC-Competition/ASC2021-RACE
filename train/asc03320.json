  "article": "Maddie Messe, 13, has always loved Temple Run, a mobile game that sends her racing through swamps   and forests to outrun a pack of crazed monkeys. What she didn't love was being forced to play as a boy -- unless she was willing to buy a female version. \"I felt like l was being cheated or misrepresented,\" Maddie explains.\"Girls are just as capable   of running away from monkeys as boys are.\"\nSo last winter, Maddie researched 50 of the most popular iPhone games. What she found was infuriating:90 percent offered free male characters, but only 15 percent let you play as a female for free.\nArmed with those statistics, Maddie drafted a spirited article and fired it off to several major newspapers. The Washington Post agreed to run the piece, which attracted millions of readers around the globe -- including the makers of Temple Run! \"We realized she had a point,\" says Natalia Luckyanova, the game's co-creator. \"It was the kick in the pants we needed to say,'We should fix it.'So we did.\"\nNow you can play Temple Run with a female character for free, but Maddie hopes her campaign inspires something deeper.\"If you don't see characters that look like you on TV or in movies or games, speak up! Just do your research first,\"says Maddie. \"One well-supported argument is much more effective than a million angry complaints.\"",
