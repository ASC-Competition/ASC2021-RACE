  "article": "Thomas Alva Edison  was awarded more patents  on inventions than any other American. When he died in 1931, Americans wondered how they could best show their respect for him. One suggestion was that the nation observe a minute or two of total blackout(,). All electric power  would be shut off in homes, streets, and factories. Perhaps his suggested plan made Americans realize fully what Edison and his inventions mean to them. Electric power was too important to the country. Shutting it off for even a short time would have led to complete confusion . A blackout was out of the question.\nOn the day of Edison's funeral  ,many people silently dimmed  their lights. In this way they honoured the man who had done more than anyone else to the great force of electrity",
