  "article": "When Shakespeare was twenty-one, he went to London to try his fortune in that great city, and a very interesting place was the London of his day.\nThere was the famous London Bridge and St. Paul's Cathedral, and palaces and markets and long streets full of shops.\nThen, too, there were the daily crowds where people from all over the world could be seen. Knights,scholars and the highwayman  or thief,who had been infamous for his clever robberies, passed by each other. Here, also, were noblemen dressed in gold, from Italy and Spain and France; slaves from Spanish America, sea captains and ministers, soldiers and servants--all held by chance or interest within the gray walls which circled London, and whose gates gave welcome to as strange a crowd as could be found in the world.\nInto this curious crowd came Shakespeare, quick to see and eager to learn. And before long all these strange sights were as familiar to him as the faces of his own town's residents. Each _ told its story to him so plainly that, as before he had learned the secrets of the fields and woods, so now he learned men and men's interests that make up the great world.\nAnd he learned these lessons so well that when he came to write his plays, he made such use of them as no writer ever made before or since; for it is the use of this knowledge of the world, combined with his own genius, that makes Shakespeare the greatest dramatist that has ever lived.",
