  "article": "Mr William Shakespeare and the Internet\nExplanation of Contents\nThis is the fourth edition of these pages. It is hard to believe, but once again they are new and improved. My motive in publishing these pages remains to help and stimulate others in Shakespeare studies, and especially those who might contribute their work to the Internet. The spirit of altruism   that originally built the Internet is not quite gone, though, sadly, through the pressure of time and profit has lessened.\nA major new addition to the pages is a Shakespeare Timeline, which is an online biography mounted at this site. The problems with searching for Shakespeare resources using the available Search Engines are:\n---- It is difficult to focus most searches so that you get a manageable number of relevant hits;\n---- It is impossible by simply reading an abstract  to make any distinction between the output of a Junior High School student and that of a professional researcher.\nAnother change in these pages over previous editions is the \"What's News\" page.  If you come away from these pages with the feeling that they are very useful but slightly pedantic  , I will have realized my goal.\nAn Apology\nI am continually apologizing to the many who have written me requesting revisions of the pages. We are all too busy. I simply have not had the time to dedicate to these pages that I wish. But I love the material and so have, at long last, made some time to update them.\nA Reminder to Young Students\nThese pages contain the best links I can find to Shakespeare on the Internet. As a reminder, I would say I very much enjoy hearing from people who view and use these pages. If you want to do Shakespeare research using the web, this page is a great starting point, and I keep it as current as I can. The web is in its infancy(in bringing good, scholarly content to students. Don't forget the best, if not quickest, resources are still in your library.",
