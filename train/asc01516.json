Some 30 years ago on from his death, he is still respected by many people in the West.\nThe Beatles, formed in 1960 in Liverpool, were one of the most commercial successful acts on the history of pop music, with, according to some estimates, global record sales over 1.1 billion.\nThe band conveyed the progressive ideals in which many young people of the time believed.\nIn the 1960s and 70s, widespread tension developed in both British and American society, regarding issues such as women's rights and the Vietnam War.\nLennon in particular became known for his message of peace and for his opposition to the war in Vietnam. This led to an attempt by former US president Richard Nixon to drive him away from the US. Lennon's second-wife Yoko Ono was also politically active.\nLennon was also hugely admired for his musical abilities. Along with fellow-Beatle Paul, Lennon and McCartney were the Beatle's song-writing team.\nAfter Lennon was shot by crazy fan Mark Chapman,one of his most iconic songs, Imagine, became a humanist anthem .\nLennon's legacy survived his death and continued till this day. In 2008, he was ranked the fifth greater singer of all time in US-based Rolling Stone magazine.\nFormer possessions of Lennon or furnishings from his homes continue to be sold for vast sums.\nIn an auction  to be held next week in London, lines written by Lennon on the back of a demand for an outstanding bill are expected to sell for PS350,000(3.7 million yuan).\nIn August, a bathroom from his last home in Britain, was auctioned for PS9,500. And in 2009, a British film describing his early years before the Beatles began, was one of the most successful films of the years in the UK.\nBut do Lennon and his music continue to resonate  with the young people of today?",
