  "article": "When we heard that our friend astronaut Gregory Chamitorff was going to be on board the last flight of the space shuttle Endeavour, we asked him if he would answer some questions from space. He said yes!\nHere are our questions and Greg's answers from space.\nWhat's the best thing about being in space?\nZero-gravity  is by far the best thing about being in space. It does not really mean that there is no gravity. It means that we are moving around Earth in the same way the space station is moving around Earth. So we are floating inside the space station.\nWe travel around Earth once every 90 minutes. That's 16 sunrises and sunsets every day. Really fast!\nInside the station, we can fly around like superman. It's an amazing feeling, and I hope everyone gets a chance to fly in space someday to experience the wonder of zero-gravity.\nWhat do you do for fun in the space shuttle?\nThere are so many things you can do in zero-gravity that are fun. Flying around is fun. Eating food that floats is fun.\nI like to play like Superman and see how far I can fly without touching any walls. Another fun thing is to play with water. Most of all, the most exciting thing to do is to look out the window at our beautiful planet Earth below. You never get tired of seeing it like that, the way it really is and it can never be seen that way while standing on its surface.\nWhat's the coolest thing about being on a spacewalk?\nWow! Doing a spacewalk is cool. There is nothing more wonderful than floating in space in your own space suit. It's amazing, and when you are doing a spacewalk, you are \"out there\" just floating in empty space, like the earth, like the moon, like the sun, like the space station. It's not science fiction. It's real.",
