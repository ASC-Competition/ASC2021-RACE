  "article": "The other day at a supermarket, I saw a naughty boy of about six crying loudly, falling to the floor and refusing to move. All the while the troubled mother was trying to persuade him to behave well but failed.A little smack on his bottom would have done the job,I thought.\nTeenagers also cause discipline problems.As a teacher, I had a 16-year-old student who had fallen in love with a waiter at a fast-food restaurant.In fact,she had left home to stay with him.So we decided to put her in the school hostel.She refused.When she heard her mother begging her to stay in the hostel she turned round and said:\"Why don't you stay in the hostel if you like it so much?\"\nMy palms were itching to slap her for being so rude but the poor mother continued to _ her,hoping that gentle persuasion would work wonders.It did not.The last I heard,she had run away from home again.\nThe list goes on and on.Could it be that today's parents are softer and believe that they must not rod their children for fear of the bad result? Or do they actually believe that the children will get rid of the bad habits and behave well naturally as they grow older? I beg to disagree.I believe it is the parents' duty to discipline the children even at a young age.\nMy children who are now adults will prove the fact that I used the rod when I thought it necessary.Later when they went abroad,they related to their British university friends on how they were disciplined.Their friends abroad were filled with horror and told my daughter that I could be charged with child abuse .However,my daughter showed great respect for me when she told them that she would not be where she was today if not for my strict discipline.",
