  "article": "Mr. and Mrs. Wilson lived in a big city, and one summer they went to the country for their vacation. They enjoyed it very much, because it was a quiet, clean place. One day they went for a walk early in the morning and saw an old man.   He was sitting alone in the warm sun in front of his house.
