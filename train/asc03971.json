  "article": "Orville Wright was born on August 19, 1871 in Dayton, Ohio, USA and died on January 30, 1948. Together with his brother, Wilbur, he was the first airplane builder. The brothers created the first controlled, powered and heavier-than-air human flight.\nHis parents were Milton Wright and Susan Catherine Koerner and besides the two famous brothers they had five children. One day after a trip his father brought as a gift a small helicopter. The kids loved it and as they played daily with it after a while it broke. The brothers managed to create a new one. Wright even let go his plans of attending Yale. He spent his time helping his ill mother and reading in his father's library.\nIn 1884 the family decided to move to Dayton and they remained there until the 1870's. A printing press was built by the two and Wilbur was an editor. In 1892 they started being fascinated by the aeronautical   events of that time. Then they started to create an airplane and Wilbur was considered the head of the team. They were the inventors of \"three axis-control\", which permitted the pilot to _ the aircraft's balance.\nIn 1900 they had their first attempts to make a functional glider -- of course it didn't have a pilot. After three years they thought of introducing an engine to the glider. At first, their patent  application was refused in 1903, but after one year it was accepted.\nOrville's first flight lasted 12 seconds and had 36.5 meters. He was responsible with the public shows near Washington in the United States. On September 9, 1908 his flight was 62 minutes and 15 seconds long and the success was huge.",
