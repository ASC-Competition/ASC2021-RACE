  "article": "How did it make you feel when you learned that KFC'S Beijing restaurants pulled three more items from their menus last week? There were fears that the items may have contained the cancer-causing coloring Sudan I.Do you have any desire to take the food provider to court because it feeds you something dangerous?\nAfter all,the law supposedly gives people the right to fight for their rights.But some experts have said it might not be so wise to take the company directly to court.\nQiu Baochang,a lawyer in Beijing,suggested that consumers not take the company directly to court.\"In addition to the high costs,consumers'complaints are unlikely to win unless they can prove they have had the banned dye at KFC,\"--Qiu explained.\nOne problem for those wanting to take action against the fast food chain is that few customers ask for or keep receipts .And,this must be the first step.\nIf they can prove that their health has been damaged by KFC,they can cue the company.But that would be almost impossible to do so because the Sudan I damage is a long-term effect and is not immediately apparent.\nA KFC spokesperson said on Monday that the company was confdent of being able to handle customers'complaints,\"We will obey legal procedure if We raceive any complaints.\"",
