  "article": "Ask any person who is successful in whatever he or she is doing what motivates him/her, and very likely the answer will be \"goals\". Goal Setting is extremely important to motivation and success. So what motivates you? Why are you in college? If you are in college because that's what your parents want, you may find it difficult to motivate yourself. Sure, it's possible to succeed with someone else providing the motivation for you. (\"If you graduate from college, I'll give you a car!\" or worse \"If you don't graduate from college, you won't get a car.\") But motivation that comes from within really makes the difference.\nCertainly, you need some intelligence, knowledge base, study skills, and time management skills, but if you don't have motivation, you won't get far. Think about this analogy. You have a car with a full tank of gas, a well-tuned engine, good set of tires, quadraphonic CD system, and a sleek, polished exterior . There it sits. This car has incredible potential. However, until a driver sits behind the wheel, puts the key in the ignition , and cranks it up, the car doesn't function. You guessed it; the KEY is MOTIVATION.\nInterest is an important motivator for a student. So is a desire to learn. When you link these two things together, you create success. Often success in an endeavor  leads to more interest and a greater desire to learn, creating an upward spiral  of motivation toward a goal you have established.\nSo be honest with yourself. Are you genuinely interested in being in college? Have you set realistic goals for yourself? How can you develop the internal motivation that really counts? When it comes to motivation, KNOWING is not as important as DOING.",
