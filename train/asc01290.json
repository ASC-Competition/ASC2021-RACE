This is awful! They either do not care anymore, or have completely lost it. I never thought U2 would become irrelevant, but they have officially become one of those bands that you will now say, \"Remember when they were great?\"\n----- Posted by Ronald Harris\nFebruary 28th, 2009 8:29 pm GMT\nTotal drivel, Mr Harris. The new album is great, far better than the safe, cynical HTDAAB and ATYCLB. U2 have become inventive again, like they were in the 1990s. thank goodness!\n----- Posted by Dan\nMarch 3rd, 2009 12:09 pm GMT\nAgree, Dan. The new album is the best since Actung Baby. Magnificent is an anthem in the waiting, Breathe is unbelievable, and Stand Up Comedy is absolutely outstanding----- to name just three! Loving the new sound, pure class as usual.\n----- Posted by Martin\nMarch 4th, 2009 7:43 pm GMT\nTotally agree with you guys. This album is unbelievable. Breathe is definitely a great song, same with Moment of Surrender. I bet their upcoming tour will be amazing. If you haven't bought the CD yet, you should. I bought mine on Amozon.com for $3.99. I couldn't believe it.\n----- Posted by Josh Briggs",
