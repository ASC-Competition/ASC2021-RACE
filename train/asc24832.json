Even children and old people can drive them to schools or parks.\nIf everyone drives such cars in the future, there will be less pollution in the air. There will be more space for all the cars in cities, and there will also be more space for people to walk in the streets.\nThe little cars of the future will cost less money to buy and to drive.

They will go 450 kilometers, then they have to stop for more gas.\nThey are nice cars, aren't they?",
