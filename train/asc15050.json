  "article": "Did anyone find the names of \"Great Britain\", \"the United Kingdom\", \"England\" and \"the British commonwealth\" which have the same meaning? Strictly speaking, these names all refer to something different. None of them are exactly the same as any of the others.\nThe British isles refer to the main islands and several thousand small ones as well, which you can see on the map. Great Britain, or Britain, refers to the larger of the two main islands. But the word \"Britain\" is often used as a short form for the United Kingdom or you call it the UK.\nNow as for England, it refers simply to the largest of the three countries on the island of Great Britain. The United Kingdom is the name of the state and the official name of the country, which many people popularly refer to England.\nFinally, the Britain commonwealth is the usual name for what is left of the British Empire  . This change shows the weakening of British Empire and the rising of the national liberation movements throughout the world today.",
