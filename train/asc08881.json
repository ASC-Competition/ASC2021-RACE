  "article": "China is casting a huge shadow on the United States that many Americans are struggling to learn Chinese in order to maintain their competitive edge.\n\"Interest in learning Chinese among American youth and their parents has grown dramatically  in the past five years,\" said Vivien Stewart at the Asia Society, a US grow trying to bridge the gap between Americans and people of Asia and the Pacific.\nChina, the world's most popular nation, is very important to the United States because it is a leading trader, consumer and investor. Its political influence is also rising across the globe. It has replaced the United States as the world's largest consumer and could become the second largest economy country in the world, after the superpower status and its telling effects politically, economically and culturally are driving the interest to learn the language, experts say.\nFrom kindergartens to high schools, studies by the Asia Society show, there is a \"rapid rise\" in interest among pupils to study the Chinese language.\nEven though the US State Department has stressed the Chinese language \"important \" to national prosperity  and security, the \"current infrastructure   to support recruitment   of students and teachers as well as the growth of high quality programs is badly inadequate,\" an Asia Society study says. The Society has set a target of having at least 5% of American high school students learning Chinese by 2015. \" Millions of Chinese are learning English, but only 24,000 Americans are learning Chinese,\" said Andrew Corcoran of the San Francisco - based Chinese American International School.",
