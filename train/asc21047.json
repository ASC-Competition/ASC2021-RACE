  "article": "Many teenagers feel that the most important people in their life are their friends. They believe that their family don't know them as well as their friends do. In large families ,it is quite often for brothers and sisters to fight ,and then they can only go to their friends for some ideas.\nIt's very important for teenagers to have one good friend or a group of friends. Even when they are not with their friends, they usually spend much time on the phone. This communication   is very important in children's growing up, because friends can be the right one to talk about something with .These things are difficult to say to the family.\nHowever, parents often try to choose their children's friends for them. Some parents even ask their children not to meet their good friends.",
