  "article": "In England, people don't often talk much. You can get on a bus or a train,and everyone sits looking out of the window.\nOften they read books and papers, but they don't talk much. When you meet English people they often talk about one thing--weather  . So when you meet somebody in England, you can say, \"Nice weather for the time of year!\" \"But it is a little cold today,\" somebody may answer. \"But it will be a little warmer later,\"you can say. Talk like this, and the English people will think,\" How friendly you are !\"",
