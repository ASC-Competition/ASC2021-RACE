  "article": "Recently, I happened to hear a mother and daughter in their last moments together at the airport as the daughter prepared to leave.\nThey hugged and the mother said \"I love you and I wish you enough.\" They kissed and the daughter left.\nThe mother walked over to the window where I sat. Standing there, I could see she was going to cry. I tried not to disturb her but she welcomed me by asking \"Have you ever said goodbye to someone knowing it would be forever?\"\n\"Yes,\" I replied. \"But may I know why this is the final goodbye?\"\n\"I am ill and she lives so far away. It's highly possible that the next trip back will be for my funeral \" she said.\n\"When you were saying goodbye, I heard you say 'I wish you enough'. May I ask what that means?\"\n\"That's a wish that has been handed down from past generations. My parents used to say it to everyone.\" She paused for a moment and looked up as if trying to remember it in detail and she smiled even more.\n\"When we say 'I wish you enough', we want the other person to have a life filled with just enough good things to be with them\". Then turning to me, she shared the following:\n\"I wish you enough sun to keep your attitude bright.\n\"I wish you enough rain to appreciate the sun more.\"",
