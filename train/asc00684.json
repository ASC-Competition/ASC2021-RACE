  "article": "I was twenty-two, and in Bolivia. I'd been to every other country in South America, and now I was set on getting into Chile, the last on the list.\nAfter several days, I reached the hills. It was cold, and even the distant mountains were clear. The days were lonely, but one evening I met Filomeno and his fellow teachers. They tried to persuade me not to go to Chile, saying it was a bad place, and that I would be killed. I didn't believe them. I knew nothing of the current politics; I just wanted to go there.\nSo I walked into the mountains, feeling excited, and came to a sign with the word \"Chile\" on it.

The police chief then told me, \"There's nothing for you here.\" I explained that I had come to see this beautiful country. But he was annoyed.\nIn the evening they filled me with food.

Throwing my belongings into my backpack, I shouted and screamed at the soldiers. After all this effort I was being sent home! I stomped   towards Bolivia expecting to feel a bullet. But I'd be back! I told myself.",
