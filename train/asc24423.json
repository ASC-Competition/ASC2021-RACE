Stefanie Sun is touched   by those poor kids there: \"Some children are already 3 or 4 years old, but they are so thin that you can hold them with your single arm. You can see scare  and hopelessness in their eyes. The children only wish to have food to eat, and can survive and go to school. However, these basic needs are like dreams to them.\"\nStefanie Sun is deeply touched by a 4-month baby who weighs only 2.5kg! Stefanie says that the children have nothing but leaves  to eat during famine. The reconstruction   in that area needs enough food, education, and clean water.",
