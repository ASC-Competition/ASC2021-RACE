    "What was older people's attitude towards personal computers at first?"
  ],
  "article": "One form of social prejudice against older people is the belief that they cannot understand or use modern technology. Activities like playing computer games, going on the Net and downloading MP3s are only for the youngsters. Isn't it unfair that older people enjoying a computer game should be frowned  upon by their children and grandchildren?\nNowadays older people have more control over their lives and they play a full part in society. Moreover, better health care has left more people in their sixties and seventies feeling fit and active after retirement. Mental activity, as well as physical exercise, can contribute to better health. Playing computer games is a very effective way of exercising the brain.\nWhen personal computers were first introduced, most older people didn't believe they would ever familiarize themselves with it. Now computers have been around for a few generations and retired people have gradually become more relaxed about using them for fun. Gamers over 65 prefer playing puzzle games and card games. Kate Stevens, aged 72, says: \"I find it very relaxing. It's not very demanding, but you still need to concentrate.\"\nAnother development that has favored \"grey games\" is a change in the type of videogames available on the market. There's a greater variety of games to choose from, including more intellectual and complex strategy  and simulation  games. Internet Chess and Train Simulator are among the most popular of these. Train Simulator is based on real-world rail activities. Players can choose from a variety of challenges, such as keeping to a strict-timetable and using helper engines during a winter storm.\nSome people argue that \"grey gamers\" simply don't have the skills required for computer games, and that teenagers are better. _ . Most computer games require the kind of analytical thinking that improves with practice, which means that the \"grey gamers\" may well be far better than gamers half a century younger than them. In games where speed is the main consideration, older people would be at a disadvantage because they may have slower reaction times. On the other hand, \"grey gamers\" have a preference for slower paced, mind challenging games.",
