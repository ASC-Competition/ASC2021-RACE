And they are all in the Guinness Book of Records(<<>> ).\nThe book is going to celebrate its birthday this August. It began exactly half a century ago. And it's always one of the best selling books in the world.\nPeople now can break over 1000 records every week! Why do so many people want to break the records? Do they want their names in the book or meet more people around the world? \"It gives people a chance to show they're the best in the world.\" said one of the record keepers Stewart Newport.\nThe book was started by Hugh Beaver from Britain.
