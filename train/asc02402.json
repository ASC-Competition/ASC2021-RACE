  "article": "Warley Woods Community   Trust\nWelcome to our third newsletter of the year!\nOur main activity for March is our Walk for the Woods fundraising events on Saturday,17thMarch,starting any time between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. We will be walking the distance between Warley Woods and Tipperary. It is indeed a long way-80 miles. The more people that you can get sponsor you,the more money we can raise to help look after our beautiful woodland. More information is available at our website.\nThe Sunday volunteers planted two beeches and on oak last week. This was thanks to the money fro the Big Tree Plant and to Lisa and Gordon Whitiker,whose friends gave money for the big trees instead of for their wedding presents. Thanks to everyone who took part.\nThere were 15 volunteers at the Oral History Training Day which was led by vey ably by Julia Letts. The group will be meeting again and will start to interview the local people who have offered to tell their stories. We are happy to hear from others who would like to be interviewed about their memories of the Woods for the project. If you or anyone you know is interested,please call Viv Cole at the office. This project is financed by Heritage Lottery Fund.\nThere was a huge response to the Forest Schools activities held at half term. These will be held again during the Easter holidays on the following dates: 4thApril from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. for over 8s. On 12th April form 10 a.m. to 12 noon,there will be a Teddy Bears' Picnic for the under 8s. All these must be booked in advance.\nFinally,don't forget the Easter Egg Roll on Bank Holiday,9th April,staring at 11 a.m. Bring your own hard-boiled and decorated egg to roll down the hill in the woods. The first past the finishing line will win a large chocolate egg! This year,due to popular demand,there will also be an Adults' Easter Egg Roll following the children's competition.\nWe look forward to seeing you all soon,at one of our many events.",
