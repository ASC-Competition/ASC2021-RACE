If you're looking for the weird, the wonderful, or just odd, then these houses are the top of the list.\nUpside Down\nLike the previous upside down home, this is the type of concrete house that is more interesting to really see from the outside than it is to actually live there. The door is near the top. If you want to live here, you are going to have to deal with the crowds exploring daily.\nSatellite Home\nHaving an entire side of your house made of glass is just asking for a rock to be thrown by the local children. However, it also offers the best view surrounding the scenic home. The inside appeared to be separated into multiple tiers, with each tier broken down into various rooms.\nUFO House\nThis home is located within Taiwan at present. For those who have wondered what it would be like to be _ by aliens and forced to live within their ship for a few years, this house should offer some similar experience.\nNew Age Tree Fort\nIf you grew up a flower child, then chances are you either adapted that lifestyle into your own or would prefer to forget it. If it's the former, then the tree fort-style home would be perfect to live within. It's centered perfectly in the middle of a forested area, supported by metal beams, and built from strong wood.",
