When they get to know you're a shy kid, they'll understand you better. This also helps you feel more relaxed in talks.\nTry to smile more. When you smile, people think you're friendly and easy to talk to. Remember that other people have feelings too and most people will stay away from an angry-looking face.\nLearn to be a good talker. If you find it hard to start talks, say something nice about people around you. Think about how great you feel when someone says something nice to you. Doesn't it make you want to keep talking to that person?\nGet your attention elsewhere . Think more about ways to enjoy parties or games. Don't waste time worrying about your look or whether people like you or not.\nTake one small step at a time. Each time when you say \"Hi\" or smile at someone, say to yourself \"You did it\". Keep trying and one day you'll never feel shy when you talk about yourself.",
