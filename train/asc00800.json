While she was driving on a road,a big truck hit its head on a pickup car. _ .Kristy rushed out and ran to the pickup.Two farmers,Dean Bernhard,51, and his brother,Donald,44,were inside.\nWhen she got close,Kristy could see the unconscious driver.The other man was under the passenger seat. \"The smells were sicking.I was afraid the truck would blow up and kill us all,\" said kristy.\nThe driver of the big truck was struggling to open the passenger door,so Kristy rushed to the driver's side.Finally they opened the door.She reached in,seized the driver and, to her horror,felt her hands sink into his chest.She quickly dragged the man to safety on the roadside,then hurried back.As Kristy started down the ditch  with the passenger,the pickup exploded..She jumped on top of him and they both rolled to safety.\nToday,the two farmers,each the farmer of two children,are good friends with Kristy.To show their deep appreciation,they bought her a ring with nine diamonds---one for each member of their immediate families,and the ninth for her.",
