  "article": "Every day  we are bombarded with images, videos, music and news. In this age of  visual and aural hyper-stimulation, the medium of radio is making a phenomenal  comeback.\n\"We're at the dawn of a golden age of audio,\" said US-based podcaster Alex  Blumberg in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald. In the last month alone, 15  percent of US adults listened to a radio podcast. These statistics, released by Edison  Research, reveal the successful evolution of traditional radio broadcasts to the present  day's digital podcast format. The term \"podcast,\" was coined in 2004, but the trend only  started gaining mainstream popularity in recent years. Since the leap in consumer  demand for smartphones and tablets, podcast subscription rates have only accelerated.\nThe appeal of the podcast partially resides in its multiplatform delivery and  on-demand capabilities. You can tune in during those extra minutes of the day when  you're walking to the shops, waiting in a queue or riding the subway. Similar to television shows, podcasts are generally free to download and most offer new content  every week.\nDonna Jackson, 22, Sydney university media graduate, listens to podcasts two or three times a week, via iTunes .\"I listen while I'm pottering around the house doing  something else. It makes completing a boring task a lot more enjoyable..... And it's an  easy way of keeping in touch with what's going on in the rest of the world,\" she said.\nUnlike television and music, the audio format has the potential to create a deep impression on readers. Blumberg says this comes down to the podcast's ability \"to  create intimacy and emotional connection.\" Sydney University undergraduate Hazel  Proust, major in social work and arts, agrees. \"When you're tuned in, it feels as if the voice of the podcast's narrator is talking directly to you. It's comforting,\" said Proust.",
