  "article": "Years ago, I lived in a building in a town. There was another building across form mine, and it was only a few meters away. There lived a woman whom I had never met. I could see her sit by the window each afternoon, drinking or reading.\nSeveral months later, I noticed her window was very dirty. Everything was not clear through the window. I wondered why the woman didn't wash her window.\nOne sunny morning, I decided to clean up my apartment, including washing my windows. Late in the afternoon when I finished the cleaning, I sat down for a rest by the window. What a surprise! The woman sitting by her window was clearly seen! Her window was clean! Suddenly, I realized I had made a mistake. I was watching her through my dirty window all the time!\nThat was quite an important lesson for me. Since then, whenever I wanted to judge  someone, I asked myself first, \" Am I looking at him through the dirty window of my heart?\" Then I try to clean the window of my own world so that I may see the world clearly.",
