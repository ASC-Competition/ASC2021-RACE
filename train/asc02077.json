  "article": "New York State has passed the USA's first state law banning motorists talking on hand-held cell phones. The ban will begin November 1, although drivers caught using hand-held cell phones will be given only warnings during the first month.\nFirst-time violators  will face a $100 fine. A second time call for a $200 fine and every violation after that will cost$500.\nAt least a dozen localities  have established bans, starting in 1999; and 40 states have had bans proposed but not passed.At least 23 countries, including the Great Britain, Italy, Israel and Japan, ban drivers from using hand-held cell phones.\nThere are about 115 million cell phones in use in the United States and more than 6 million in New York State.\n\"To think that I'm not going to use cell phone when at the same time I can still use my laptop, I still can read a paper, I can still change my pants  while driving 65 mph. I think there's just something wrong,\" an official said.\nOther critics noted that other things like eating, drinking coffee and applying make-up while driving posed  at least as much of a concern. They suggested that the ban include a broader range of things.",
