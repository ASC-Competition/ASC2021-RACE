  "article": "I have many new teachers in high school, but Lori Runkle, my English Language and Composition teacher, is my favorite teacher.\nMs. Runkle enjoys getting to know more about students, so I have many chances to talk with her after class. I have always wanted to become a journalist  . Since Ms. Runkle used to be a journalist back in the United States, she has introduced many helpful journalistic writing skills to me.\nAlthough she is my teacher, Ms. Runkle and I are more like friends. She often invites my classmates and me to take part in different activities outdoors. For example, I went to listen to a journalist's speech, which helped me better understand current events  .\nNot only does Ms. Runkle talk with me outside of school, she is also a great teacher in the classroom. English Language and Composition is a really hard subject for a second language learner. We felt worried in the beginning, but Ms. Runkle really makes an effort to help us out. In class, Ms. Runkle always encourages students to question everything to keep us active. One part of class I love the most is when groups of students are requested to give speeches on events that are happening in the world. It requires a lot of deep thinking and I really learn quite a lot from it.\nI love Ms. Runkle very much. She not only helps me to get good scores, but also acts as a good friend and always gives me advice on life.",
