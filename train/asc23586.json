  "article": "A man punished his 5-year-old daughter for wasting some expensive gold wrapping paper. Money was little and he became more upset when the child used the gold paper to decorate a box and put it under a Christmas tree.\nHowever, the little girl brought the gift box to her father the next morning and said, \" This is for you, daddy.\"\nThe father was embarrassed by his earlier anger, but he got angry again when he found the box empty. He spoke to her in a serious manner, \"Don't you know young lady, when you give someone a present, there's supposed to be something inside the package?\"\nThe little girl looked up at him with tears in her eyes and said, \"Oh Daddy, it is not empty.I blew kisses into it until it was full.\" The father was moved. He fell on his knees and put his arms around his little girl and he begged her to forgive his unnecessary anger.\nAn accident took the life of the child away only a short time later and it is told that the father kept the gold box by his bed for all the years of his life. Whenever he was discouraged or faced difficult problems, he would open the box and take out an imaginary kiss and remember the child who had put it there.",
