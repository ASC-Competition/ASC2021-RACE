  "article": "Life's coincidences   can be good or bad, but they always surprise us. I moved to Anderson in 2004 from a small town in New York. One day I stopped at a red light and was behind a car with a license plate that read \"Pearl Harbor Survivor\". My father was a Pearl Harbor survivor, so I jumped out of my truck and tapped to his window. He rolled the window down and I asked if he was a Pearl Harbor survivor.\n\"Yes,\" he said. The lights turned green so I got back in my truck, turned left and went home straight. Then, I said to myself, \"Why didn't I get his name and phone number?\" I went to the local Legion Post and asked if there was a Pearl Harbor survivor here on their roster  . They told me yes and his name was Bronsil Metz. I looked up his name in the phone book and gave him a call. However, I failed to reach him anyway. I then drove to his address. With no answer to the door, I left a note saying that I would like to speak with him.\nThe next day Metz called me back and we arranged to meet at his house. I gathered my father's picture albums and drove to his house the next morning. My father passed away years ago, so I was filled with excitement about talking to someone with similar experiences. We two went through the albums. As I turned the pages, he started pointing out the people he knew as well as those familiar buildings. My father was a great record keeper, so after Metz named people in some pictures, I took the photos out and on the back, in my father's handwriting, were the names, _ that Metz did really know the people. At that moment, I was stunned   .",
