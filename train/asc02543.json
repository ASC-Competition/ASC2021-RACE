  "article": "Look carefully and you'll find musicians at the top of almost any industry. The television broadcaster Paula Zahn(cello) and the NBC chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd (French horn) attended college on music scholarships; Both Microsoft's Mr. Allen and the venture capitalist Rogar McNamee have rock bands. Lorry Page, a co-founder of Google, played saxophone in high school. The former World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn has played cello at Carnegie Hall.\nThe connection isn't a coincidence. I know because I asked. I put the question to top-flight professionals in industries from tech to finance to media, all of whom had serious ( if often little-known) past lives as musicians. Almost all made a connection between their music training and their professional achievements.\nWill your school music program turn your kid into a Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft (guitar)? Or a Woody Allen (clarinet )? Probably not. These are outstanding achievers. But the way these and other visionaries   I spoke to process music is interesting.\nBut the key question is: why does that connection exist? Paul Allen offers an answer. He says music \"establish your confidence in the ability to create.\" He began playing the violin at age 7 and switched to the guitar as a teenager. Even in the early days of Microsoft, he would pick up his guitar at the end of marathon days of programming. The music was the emotional analog   to his day job, both of them show his different creativity. He says, \"something is pushing you to look beyond what currently exists and express yourself in a new way.\"\nFor many of the high achievers I spoke with, music functions as a \"hidden language,\" as Mr. Wolfensohn calls it, one that enhances the ability to connect different or even opposite ideas. When he ran the World Band, Mr. Wolfensohn traveled to more than 100 countries, often taking in local performances (and occasionally joining in on a borrowed cello), which helped him understand \"the culture of people\".\nConsider the qualities these high achievers say music has sharpened : cooperation, creativity, discipline and the capacity to coordinate   conflicting ideas. All are qualities obviously absent from public life. Music may not make you a genius, or rich, or even a better person. But it helps train you to think differently, to process different points of views --- and most important, to take pleasure in listening.",
