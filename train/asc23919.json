  "article": "As you know, the great American writer Jack London was often in need of money when he began writing his books. He worked hard but it didn't help him.\nOnce he promised   a New York magazine to write a story for it, but he was busy at that time and could not keep his promise. The boss   of the magazine wrote letters to Jack London several times to ask him to send the story. At last he went to Jack London's room and left a note   .\n\"Dear Jack London, if I don't get the story in twenty-four hours, I'll come to your room and kick   you downstairs, and I always keep my promise.\"\nJack London read the note and answered, \"Dear Dick, if I could do my work with my feet like you, I could keep my promise, too.\"",
