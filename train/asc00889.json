  "article": "Hello, I'm Severn Suzuki speaking for E.C.O. -- The Environmental Children's Organization.\nComing here today, I am fighting for my future. I am here to speak for all generations to come. I am here to speak on behalf of   the starving children around the world whose cries go unheard. I am here to speak for the countless animals dying across this planet because they have nowhere left to go. I am afraid to go out in the sun now because of the holes in the ozone  . I am afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemicals are in it.\nYou don't know how to fix the holes in our ozone layer. You don't know how to bring back an animal now extinct. And you can't bring back forests that once grew where there is now desert. If you don't know how to fix it, please stop breaking it!\nHere, you may be delegates of your governments, business people, organizers, reporters or politicians-- but really you are mothers and fathers, brothers and sister, aunts and uncles-- and all of you are somebody's child.\nAt school, even in kindergarten, you teach us to behave in the world. You teach us: not to fight with others, to respect others, to clean up our mess, not to hurt other creatures, to share-- not be greedy. Then why do you go out and do the things you tell us not to do?\nDo not forget why you're attending these conferences, who you're doing this for-- we are your own children. You are deciding what kind of world we will grow up in. But are we even on your list of priorities? My father always says \"You are what you do, not what you say.\"\nWell, what you do makes me cry at night. You grown-ups say you love us. I challenge you, please make your actions reflect your words. Thank you for listening.",
