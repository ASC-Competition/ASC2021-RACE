  "article": "Dear Sir,\nI have to travel every day from Souk Road to the airport. Two buses travel along their route  : the number 49 and number 16. But by the time the number 16 bus reaches Souk Road it is always full, so I can't get on it. I have to wait for the number 49, because sometimes there are empty seats on it.\nThe timetable says that there are buses from Souk Road to the airport every ten minutes. If this is so, why do I have to wait half an hour for a bus nearly every day?\nThe regulations say that if there are empty seats on a bus, the bus must stop at every stop where people are waiting. Why do the half-empty buses go straight past me when I am standing at the bus stop?\nThe regulations say that no bus may carry more than 40 seated passengers  and 20 standing passengers. Yesterday I was the first to get off the bus when it reached the airport. I counted the other passengers as they got off. There were 129 of them.\nIt is clear that our bus companies break the regulations and think little of their passengers. Can nothing be done to make your service  better?\nYours\nTired passenger",
