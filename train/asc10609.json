  "article": "Three months ago, Mariza Castro leftprefix = st1 /Honduras. Today, she is in theUnited Statesand she has a job. Castro works behind the counter at McDoald's. Speed is an important part of her work life. Fast - food counter workers are expected to serve customers in less than a minute. At McDonald's they say, \"Work fast or you don't last.\"\n       Are McDonald's workers lucky to have their jobs? Or are they being _ ? The answer depends on who you talk to.\n       McDoald's does many good things. For example, no other company hires more young people than McDonald's. More than half of its workers are under 20 years old. McDonald's also has a good record of hiring minority workers. Thirteen percent of its workers are black. This is better than any otherUScompany.\n       But the burger house has its critics as well. The pay bothered Edward Rodriguez. He worked for nearly a year at a Los Angeles McDonald's. During that time he got only one 10 - cent raise. \"I used to joke that working for McDonald's is the closest thing to slave labour in theUStoday,\" he days. Today, most McDonald's pay about $ 5.00 an hour. They hire new workers constantly. The restaurant has no other choice because 70 percent of its workers quit or are fired every year.\n       But McDonald's also gets its share of praise. Its best workers move up quickly. Just talk to 17 - year - old Ameer Abdur - Razaaq of Harlem, New York City. \"They call me 'Young Crew Chief' around my block,\" he says. \"When else can I go at my age and be in charge of this many people?\" He sees the job as the first step in his career.\n       However, most McDoald's crew members never make it to manager because the job pressure is so intense, and the rewards so few. As one worker put it, \"They expect a lot and they don't pay you much.\"",
