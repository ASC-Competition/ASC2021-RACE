  "article": "Children are often far more gifted than what their parents or teachers can realize.IQ tests do not measure creative talents.By depending on them to measure intelligence,therefore,we miss out on the talents of many of our most gifted youngsters.Most children start life with valuable creative potential.Unfortunately,many of them have it knocked out of them,so to speak,by the time they reach the 4th grade.It is not that parents and teachers deliberately squelch  creativity;or rather,they fail to recognize it.By simply observing the child at work or at play,you may detect creativity,if you look for the following key signs:\n*Curiosity.The child's questioning is persistent and purposeful.He is not content with given explanations,and he would rather dig under the surface.\n*Flexibility.If one approach doesn't work,the child quickly thinks of another.\n*Sensitivity to Problem.He is quick to see gaps in information.He is sensitive to contradictions between prior rules and what he hears or reads.\n*Selffeeling.He has a feeling of being somebody in particular.He is selfmotivated,selfdirected,and can work alone for long periods provided it's on his own project.\n*Originality.He has surprising,uncommon,interesting ideas.His drawings and stories have a style that marks them as his own.\n*Insight.He has easy access to realms  of the mind that noncreative people visit only in their dreams.He toys with ideas that easily come to him.\nQualities like these count very little in IQ tests,which measure memory,vocabulary,mathematical ability and general reasoning.These abilities are valuable,and the creative child does usually have them.However,the child with a socalled genius IQ of 180 is in reality no more likely to be a genius than the child with a slightly aboveaverage IQ of 120.In fact,evidence suggests that some children with high IQs may develop memory and logical reasoning powers at the expense of insight,imagination,and adventurous qualities that are essential to geniuses.",
