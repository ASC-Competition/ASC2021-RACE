  "article": "Finding a good friend can be quite difficult in the contemporary lives of teenagers. I was once baffled by what the definition of a good friend was,until I discovered a single step that,if taken,would make you the greatest friend.\nIt is willingness. That is all it takes in order to be considered a good friend. Willingness must come from within your heart. Listening to your friends makes them feel important, special and wanted. The will to sacrifice  for your friends will also take you a step closer to being a good friend. For instance,as you are about to leave to enjoy your Saturday night,your best friend calls you right when you are stepping out and tells you how terrible he feels,and then you must be willing to give up your Saturday night and go to your friend's house and try to comfort him in any way that you can.\nYou must always be willing to give advice to your friends. For example, if your friends are in a situation where they do not know what to do,you must be willing to think things through and try to give them the best advice. The willingness to care is also a big must in being a good friend. You must care about how your friends feel and what they're experiencing. Caring about your friends is one of the best things you can do,because when your friends are in their time of need and the whole world seems to turn against them,you must be the one to care.\nNobody ever said being a good friend was easy. If you want to be a good friend,you have to be willing to listen, sacrifice,give advice and care about your friends.",
