  "article": "Next time you're in a public place, take a look around you, and count how many people are using their phones. I can tell you that it is probably more than half, whether you're in a bus, in a cafe or simply walking down the street.\nI'm not saying that I am not an example of this, but I wonder how people can spend so much time on their phones without actually talking to anyone in particular. We can now do almost anything with a phone. But has it gone too far? We spend too much time on our mobiles but not enough time talking to people in real life.\nLast time I visited London, I traveled by subway. I noticed that almost everybody else\nwas on their phones except those who were asleep. People were playing games, reading articles and listening to music.\nRecently, my smart phone broke and I had to use an old basic phone just to keep in touch with my family and friends. I could only send text messages, make calls and play one game with it. And I loved it. I loved being free from the Internet, and I really didn't mind what my friends were doing or what the latest news was. I could enjoy my time watching the people around me and seeing what was going on.\nHowever, I  knew that as soon as I got my smart phone back, I would be one of those people once again.",
