  "article": "Last summer was Ann's first trip to Spain . She was very excited. But when she arrived at the hotel, she found that her Spanish money wasn't in her handbag. She looked for it carefully in all her bags, but she couldn't find it. She had only a ten-pound note with her. She found a place to change her English money. On her way back to the hotel, Ann bought some cheese, some bread and some oranges. She told the manager that she didn't eat Spanish food except for breakfast, because she knew the price of hotels included   breakfast. Other tourists visited places of great interest in Spain. Ann said she wasn't well. In fact, her holiday wasn't bad, except that she was hungry. After all a piece of fruit for lunch, and bread and cheese for supper isn't very much. especially not for two weeks. On the last day of her holiday, Jane, one of the tourists asked Ann why she never ate with them in the hotel restaurant. The food was delicious. Ann told her all about her money problem. Jane looked at her for a moment, and then said, \"But didn't you know the price of this hotel includes everything?\"",
