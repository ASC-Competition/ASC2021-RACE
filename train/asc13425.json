  "article": "An anxious mother watched as rescuers freed her baby from a muddy well. After being pulled from the well,the baby joyfully ran to its mom as the rescuers took a break.\nIt was a difficult and potentially dangerous rescue: the baby was an 8-month-old elephant, and at first its mother thought the humans were trying to harm it. The baby elephant fell into the five-foot-deep well near Kenya's Amboseli National Park. Local people had dug the well for water.\nIt took 30 minutes to remove the trapped elephant. While Vicki Fishlock of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants made a loud shout to frighten the mother away, two men struggled to get a rope around the baby elephant. Once the rope was in place, Fishlock used her jeep to pull the baby out.\nFishlock recognized Zombe, the mother of the trapped baby elephant,from a mark on her ear. She believes that in the end Zombe realized the humans were trying to help.\n\"Rescues where the elephant's family members are around are always stressful, and I'm always happy when everyone is safe,\" Fishlock said.\"The reunions   always bring tears to my eyes. The depth of their love for each other is one of the things that make elephants so unusual.\"\nThe very next day, another baby elephant fell into the same well. The 3-month-old's family had been driven away from the area by local people. Once it had been rescued, the Amboseli Trust had to send it to an elephant orphanage   in Nairobi, Kenya's capital city.\nThe rescues showed the _ of elephants across Africa. Elephants are fighting to survive, as conflicts between the animals and humans are increasing. Thousands of elephants are also being killed for their tusks. The tusks are sold in Asia, where ivory trinkets are in high demand.\nThe Amboseli Trust has been studying elephants and trying to help them since 1972. Fishlock said, \"We hope this rescue persuades people that elephants are special and deserve to be protected and treasured.\"",
