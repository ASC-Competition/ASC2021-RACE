  "article": "Why are so many people afraid to fail? Quite simply because we forget that failure is part of the human life and that every person has the right to fail. Every person is able to fight failure and finally succeed.\nMost parents work hard at preventing failure or protecting their children from the knowledge that they have failed. One way is to lower standards . When a child finishes making a table, the mother describes it as \"perfect\" even though it doesn't stand still. Another way is to blame others. If John fails in science, his teacher is unfair or stupid.\nThere's a problem with the two ways. It makes a child unprepared for life in the real world. Young children need to learn that no one can be best at everything, no one can win all the time, and that it's possible to enjoy a game even when you don't win. A child often feels terrible, of course, when he is not invited to a birthday party, or is not chosen into a football team. But parents should not say \"It doesn't matter.\" quickly. The young should be allowed to experience failure and be helped to come out of it.\nFailure never gives people pleasure. It hurts both adults and children. But it can be really good to your life when you learn to use it. You must learn to ask \"Why did I fail?\" Don't blame anyone else. Ask yourself what you did wrong and how you can improve. If someone else can help, don't be shy about asking them. Success just repeats what has been done. It is not as good a teacher as failure. You can learn how to give a good party from an unsuccessful one.",
