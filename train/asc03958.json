  "article": "An American psychotherapist   Glenn Doman wrote a best-selling book calledHow to Teach Your Baby to Readin 1963. Now translated into 17 languages, this book arose from his work with brain-damaged children in Pennsylvania. Doman and his team of specialists had wondered why brain-injured children didn't improve with treatment. Then they realized that orthodox  methods of treatment only relieved the symptoms, not the problem, which of course was the brain itself. So they develop a new approach. \"All we do for all the children here is to give them visual, auditory   and tactile   stimulation with increased frequency, intensity and duration, in recognition of the orderly way in which the brain grows,\" says Doman. \"The result was that by 1960 we had hundreds of severely brain-injured two-year-olds who could read and understand.\" The team had discovered that even children who had half their brains removed could, by stimulation, achieve higher IQs than the average normal child.\nThen the team began to think if such amazing results could be achieved with brain-damaged children, what would happen if the same treatment were given to normal children? So eight years ago the Better Baby Institute was opened for the benefit of normal children. The same stimulating environment was provided, and by the time the children left, around seven years old, they could generally speak and read three foreign languages, play a musical instrument, read three full-length   books a week and do all the other things that a so-called \"normal\" child could do.\nIn Doman's view, the child's passion to learn during the years up to six must be fed. He believes that, like muscles, the brain develops with use, especially so in those first few years.\nNowadays, parents come from all over the world to Pennsylvania to see and learn from the workof Doman and his team; they want to discover how they can fulfill their roles as nature's teachers, by using their love, understanding and instincts for the benefit of the children. For in the words of Doman, \"every child born has a greater potential intelligence than Leonardo da Vinci used\".",
