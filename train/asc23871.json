  "article": "A long time ago, there was a man. He wanted to buy a pair of new shoes. He measured  his feet with a straw ,and then went to a shoe shop in town.\nThe shopkeeper took out a pair of new shoes, and let him try it on. But when he looked into his pocket, he found that the straw was not there. So he said, \"I'm sorry, I forgot to bring the size  here! Let me go home to get it.\" After that, he ran out of the shop. It was very far from his home to the shoe shop. When he got back home, he was out of breath.\nWith a straw in his hand, he hurried to the shoe shop again. But the shop was closed.\nSomeone near the man said, \"Your feet are with you. Why don't you try which pair of shoes fits ? And why do you believe your straw, but not your feet?\"",
