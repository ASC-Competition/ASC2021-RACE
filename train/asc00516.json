  "article": "Dear Grandma,\nIt was nice seeing you at Christmas.You looked so happy!\nAfter losing two grandparents within the past year, I have taken some time to reflect on what is most important.I want to let you know what a positive influence you have been on me.I am the person I am because of you.\nI remember being on your farm a lot when I was younger.I remember the projects you planned for us.We painted rocks to represent our family members.We made doll clothes out of colorful socks.We made many \"playhouses\" in the woods.\nWe learned that if you left a bucket of soybeans in the rain, you would soon have a bucket of growing beans.We learned that if we helped pick the strawberries in the morning, we'd have them on our ice cream in the afternoon.We learned that some plants have funny names, like the elephant ear plant.We learned that you could make do with what you had.We learned that making things out of paper and cardboard was more fun than what came inside the packaging.We learned it was OK to get dirty, but Grandma would wash us up before Mom came.\nYou once made models of everyone's houses, which made me want to be an architect.Another time, you made quilts for all of the grandkids.I still use mine every night.The edge has worn out.\nBut you taught me how to fix it.\nI love and respect you.You are always patient, with a quiet determination.\nGrandma, thank you for everything you have taught me.I hope that I am able to pass on all these memories and skills to my children and grandchildren.\nLove always,\nKelly",
