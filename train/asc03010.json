  "article": "If you are tired of common hotel rooms, maybe it's time to climb into a tree. A new generation of tree houses are appearing across the world, and designer Roderick Romero says he knows why and he said \"They're magical. I've never seen someone climb into a tree house and not smile.\"\nEdisto River Canadys, S. C.\nBefore you can stay in one of the wilderness tree houses, you first have to canoe down the Edisto River. The paddle-in homes offer a cooking gear and comfortable sleeping bed. \"It's a really good place to get back to nature,\" Romero says. The lofts have gas stoves and are lit by lanterns. The website: caneosc.com\nTreehotel\nRomero was astonished when he first saw the buildings at this hotel 40 miles south of the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden. \"It blew my mind. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.\" he says. The hotel rooms draws heavily on spare Scandinavian design. \"Architecturally this is one of the coolest ideas for a tree house.'' The website: treehotel.se\nHideaway Cafe\nWhile most treehouses are found in the woods, this coffee shop and inn turns the idea on its head with a location in downtown Tokyo. The building itself stands on stilts with a tree growing through the center of it. The cafe was the first treehouse designed by Kobayashi Takashi, who has since created more than 120 homes. \"He's one of my heroes.\" Romero says, \"In the treehouse community, he's who we talk about the most.\" The website: treehouse.jp/ hideaway/.\nTongabezi\nOne of the world's most stylish treehouses perches in a tree alongside the Zambezi River near Victoria Falls. The large pine deck holds a bed and Turkish carpets. Guests can go on safati, or simply stay in their perch and watch for hippos playing in the river. The website: below.tongabezi.com.",
