  "article": "The class teacher thought that hobbies were important for children. So she encouraged all her students to have one, and sometimes she arranged hobby shows for their parents to see as a result.\nOne morning the teacher told the class to have a holiday and get their hobby things to school before 5 p.m. A hobby show would be held the following afternoon.\nSo in the afternoon, the students with nothing to show did their lessons at school as usual, while the lucky ones had a holiday to go home for their hobby works.\nWhen the afternoon lessons began, the teacher was surprised to see that Tommy was not there.  \"I don't believe Tommy has a hobby,\" she thought. However, at a quarter to five. Tommy arrived with a beautiful collection of butterflies  in glass case. The teacher liked the samples   very much and put them on a desk in the classroom.  But, to her surprise, Tommy picked them up again and began to leave.\n\"What are you doing, Tommy?\" she asked. \"Those things must stay here until tomorrow afternoon.  That's when the parents are coming to see them. \"\n\"I know that,\" answered Tommy, \"and I will bring them back tomorrow, but my big brother doesn't want them to be out of our house at night. \"\n\"But, aren't the butterflies yours?\" asked the teacher.\n\"No,\" answered Tommy. \"They are my brother's.\"\n\"But Tommy, you should show your own hobby here, not somebody else's. \"\n\"I know that,\" answered Tommy. What surprised her most was the answer. \"My hobby is watching my brother collecting butterflies. \"",
