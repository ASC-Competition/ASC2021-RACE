  "article": "Many people may not believe it, but this is what is happening: polar bears are dying out! They are dying because they are losing a great deal of habitat due to human incursion and global warming.  They are dying because of starvation as well.  With the sea ice they depend on for survival shrinking, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to find food.\nAn ecosystem is highly dependent on all of its parts, and removing even a single species can result in serious consequences.  Polar bears are at the top of the predators where they live.  They play an important part in the ecosystem.  They feed on seals, fish and deer.  Several other animals depend on the kill of polar bears.  The failure to save polar bears might result in loss of these predators.\nIn addition, all large predators perform a very important function in their habitat: helping to control the populations of other species.  When an animal group loses its natural predators, its population will rise rapidly, having a direct result in population decrease of other groups.  A huge boom in population of Arctic seals would have a direct effect on the prey  of seals, and could reduce numbers of certain types of fish.\nThis could also have a direct effect on humans, who might have to compete with Arctic seals for food supplies from fish. Lack of polar bears could eventually affect human food supply. Human beings shall save polar bears to ensure the food supply.\nThere is no doubt that we should save polar bears.  However, there is still another question: can they be saved? This is a matter that scientists debate because of rapid degradation of the polar bear' environment in recent years due to warming temperatures.  It is estimated that if the bears cannot adapt to changing climates, they might die out before the end of the 21stcentury, with about 50% of the animals disappearing by 2050. So time is running out!\nThere are some things that may help slow down global warming and help delay extinction of polar bears.  These include finding new energy sources that don't give off greenhouse gases and not making any more incursions into polar bear's territory.",
