The book is A fresh Summer Day. Zhao Yue finished it in three months.\nZhao Yue is a Junior One student of a middle school. She started writing this book after she finished her first book.\n\" I think it is important for me to write the life of students. Adults cannot understand the world of us. So if adults read my book, they will know more about students.\" The girl also said that she wrote most of the book at night, sometimes until the early hours of the next morning. \" I went to school as usual during the three months of writing.
