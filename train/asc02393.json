  "article": "A great loss--Shirley Temple dies at 85\nFebruary 12,2014\nBYDERRIKJ.LANG ,Associated Press\nShirley Temple Black, who died on February 10that age 85, wasn't just a child star. She was THE child star--the sweet little girl whose shining smile helped _ some of the darkest days the US has known during the Great Depression.\nIt's hard today to imagine the super star Shirley was once \"America's Little Darling\". She sang and danced her way to the top of the box office in such films as Bright Eyes, Curly Top and Heidi. By 1940, she had appeared in 43 films. Temple teamed with Bill Robison in four movies, and their dance on the stairs in The Little Colonel is still a legendary film moment.\nIn the 1930s, her name on a movie introduction assured  a packed house. She inspired dolls, dresses, dishes--even a drink (alcohol-free, of course).\nUS President Franklin D. Roosevelt once famously said that \"as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right.''\nUnlike so many of today's child stars, Temple didn't end up with her name appearing across the headlines for bad behaviors. Instead of getting her photos on front pages or struggling with drugs and alcohol, Temple went on to a second career in diplomacy  , including presidential appointments as ambassador to Ghana.\nShe surprised a lot of people who doubted her with her grace, knowledge and eagerness to serve. In fact, her career in public service (20 years) was longer than her career in movies (19). The role she valued most, however, was as wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother.\nThe world has lost a treasured Hollywood legend. But her movies will allow that little dynamic figure to continue charming audiences for a very long time.",
