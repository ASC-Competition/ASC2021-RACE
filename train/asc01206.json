  "article": "My family moved around a lot when I was growing up.In 2nd grade,I lived here in Washington D.C,where I made an amazing group of friends.I was upset when my parents told me we were moving again and I would have to leave all my best friends behind.\nIn 7th grade.we moved back to Washington D.C.And I could not have been more excited and I felt like I was finally home again.But things had changed.There were two new girls,who decided that they didn't like me,which meant no one else could,not even all my former best friends.\nAnd then one day during school,I opened my locker,only to find a note lying on the floor.The note said:Die.Nobody likes you.\nMy heart started beating faster and I felt the blood rushing to my face.I had no idea what to do.The note wasn't signed and I had no idea who had written it,but I figured the new girls were behind it.I had to sit in class all day with my head down,wondering who else knew about this shame.I felt horrible and sure that nothing would ever be good again.\nI decided that the perfect way to end all of this was with another note,left on the bathroom mirror at school.\nIt's sad for someone to bully other classmates to make themselves feel better or look cool.Bullying others is a way to impress others.It's common,but that doesn't mean it's okay.Looking cool is not worth making others feel bad.Obviously I'm very happy now,but it doesn't mean I'11 ever forget about that note or how it made me feel.And to those of you that are current victims  of bullying--know that you are NOT alone.It will get better.I promise.",
