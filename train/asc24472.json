  "article": "Dear Mary,\nI'm sorry to hear that you didn't get good grades in math mid-term exam. And you said you spend a lot of time studying math. However, it is difficult for you to learn it well. I think you should find a right way to learn it. Here is my advice for you.\nDuring the class\n* Listen to the teacher and be sure to write down everything the teacher puts on the blackboard.\n* If you don't understand a step or how to get the answer to the question, ask the teacher or a classmate for help right now.\n* Underline key points while taking notes.\nAfter the class\n* Recopy each day's notes into a new notebook clearly.\n* Do your homework every day carefully. And don't copy other students' homework.\n* If a step is unclear or you don't know how to do it, ask for help soon. _ \n* Look for useful examples of how this kind of difficult problem is used in your textbook or other materials \nBefore exam\n* Review  all of your notes quickly and find out every missing problem at times.\n* Work examples in the text each several times until you can do them quickly. This will help you improve the speed  needed for the exam.\nIf you do as I said, I think you will get good grades in the final exam. Come on! Mary.",
