  "article": "Paper is a cheap and accessible medium that can produce beautiful results. To most people, making a paper plane could be one of the simplest things to do. It's the simplest and easiest form of paper art. And paper art can be dated back to Japan, where it originated   over a thousand years ago. However, there's a special minority who takes paper art to the next level, magically turning the plain white or colored paper into some of the most amazing artworks. Check out the following artists and their works!\nThe Danish artist Peter Callesen is famous for his talent in combining the minimalism   of a white sheet of paper with the complexity of carefully cut and folded paper and uses the two to build out some pleasing works.\nThe British artist Su Blackwell often goes to secondhand bookstores -- to look for materials with which she can carve out delicate sculptures. The models look as if they \"grow\" naturally from the pages of the books. The artist finds inspiration from the book title or a paragraph or picture inside and then spends months carefully making each one into an eye-catching paper model. Her old book sculptures sell for up toPS5,000 each.\nBy carefully folding simple pieces of paper, German artist Simon Schubert creates amazing masterpieces. He turns paper into architectural masterpieces by folding a simple piece of paper to shape the creases  , then unfolding it to show the fascinating artwork.\nAnother master of paper-folding is Jen Stark. Her artwork is often in the form of colorful caves and land maps. Using her imagination and a special knife, she is a modern day magician who turns _ materials like construction paper and glue into fantastic, complicated sculptures that puzzle the eyes. Her work draws inspiration from nature.",
