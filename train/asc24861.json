  "article": "When  people    travel    in  another  city  or   country ,they  sometimes  stay  in  the  homes of the local people.  This is called _ .   It  is    a  great  experience  because  you  can  meet  people    from   a  different  country   or  city  and  learn  something  new  about   that  place   .                                                                                       I  am  Wan  Li  from  China.  I came  to  the  UK   with  my  friends  for  a  short   visit  .    we   are  living   with  an English  couple   ,Mr.   and  Mrs.Green  ,in  the  west   of    London.    They   have    a    wonderful      four -bedroom  house   .     This   is  a new   house  .  It   has    two   bathrooms     and  a   garden    with  many    beautiful    flowers.   I   have   a   bedroom    of   my   own   .\nThere  are   some    shopping    centres    and     restaurants     near     the    house,     and   the  house   is  close   to   an     underground  station. It  takes   about  thirty  minutes  to  get  to   the  centre  of  London.\nI  think   a  homestay   may  be   a  good   choice  for  you  if  it  is  your  first  time  to  visit  abroad .  The local  people  are  friendly  and  willing  to  help. If  you  happen  to  celebrate   the  holidays  with  them,  you  will  get  to  know  more  about    western  culture  and  customs.",
