  "article": "As an old-fashioned explorer, Paul Salopek sets out on foot to circle around the world. He is also a modern-day explorer. _ a few clothes, a small first-aid kit and notebooks, he is carrying a recorder, a video camera, a small computer and a satellite phone -- a telephone that connects to a satellite and can be used in many places where cell-phones don't work.\nThe journey is long: 21,000 miles! It will take seven years to complete it.\nSalopek was born in California and spent his childhood in Mexico. He says he has always liked to travel and doesn't like to rush. At the age of fourteen, he climbed Mount Whitney in California and crossed the state's Sierra Nevada Mountains alone. When he was fifteen years old, he walked the length of Death Valley. He once rode a mule 2,000 miles through mountains in Mexico.\nAs a longtime reporter, Salopek has reported from Africa, Asia and Mexico. Now 51 years old, he plans to keep writing. As he travels around the world, he is writing stories about the people he meets and the way they live. He looks for how people find local solutions to big problems such as lack of food and water. He also records the sounds he hears and takes photos of the sky and the Earth's surface.\nThe long walk started in the Rife Valley in Ethiopia in East Africa. Many consider East Africa to be home to the first humans, who lived 160,000 years ago.\nSalopek is retracing the paths our ancestors took as they left Africa and settled in parts of  the Middle East, Europe, Asia and the Americas. As Salopek is walking, he is learning more about himself and all of humankind.",
