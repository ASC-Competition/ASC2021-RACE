  "article": "South Africa hosted the fifth BRICS Summit in March 2013,which completed the first cycle of BRICS summits,BRICS is an acronym for the powerful grouping of the world's leading up-and-coming economies,namely Brazil,Russia,India,China and South Africa.The BRICS aims to achieve peace,security,development and cooperation.It also seeks to contribute to the development of humanity and build a more stable and fairer world.\nThe industry leaders from the business communities of the five countries agreed that the BRICS countries will actively support industrialization on the African continent in order to contribute significantly to its development and to expand trade links between Africa and  BRICS.The global economic situation,though improving,continues to remain uncertain with the Euro-crisis a major concern.The task ahead is to build on these developments and BRICS countries remain committed to the cause of promoting sustainable growth.Greater economic cooperation among BRICS countries can be significantly important,which will prove beneficial for global economic growth.\nAccording to Dr.Rob Davies,South African Minister of Trade and Industry,the African continent is recognized as the second fastest growing continent after Asia.There are four drivers of the economic growth in African continent.These are the boom in mineral products in the African continent,the development of the service industries,the benefit of not having the financial crisis,and infrastructure development.Davies also adds that other BRICS countries have advantage of large populations providing big home markets for their products.The South African population is small compared to other BRICS countries,but if you add up numbers on continent then you have a critical mass that can support the new industrial wave in Africa:That is why the South African needs to create large trading blocks across large parts of African continent.",
