  "article": "As a child, I always thought about what the college admissions process would look like for me. I dreamed of the day when I'd get my first acceptance letter, and go on to learn as much as I could about many things as possible.\nHowever, as I got older, my fears of going to college _ . I'm a senior now, and the college admissions process isn't exactly what I dreamt of when I was 7 years old. There are deadlines to meet, majors to choose, and how am I going to pay for all of this ? My mind plays tricks on me, convincing that my roommate will hate me and that my classes will be horribly boring and that each day will begin at five in the morning. To be honest, while I have many reasons to be excited for the next journey in my educational pursuits, I'm also scared to death.\nI've invested hours upon hours studying for AP tests, SATs and ACTs. My peers and I sacrificed our Friday night football games, school dances and field trips to do better in studies in school. But is it all worth it ? What if the promise of college ends up being disappointing rather than a relief ?\nIn a year from now, my whole life will change. I'll be a legal adult. My dorm might be in Paris, Los Angeles or Chicago. I'll be doing my own laundry, cooking my own food and paying for things on my own. I'll meet entirely new people and say goodbye to others. But isn't that also the joy of life ? I want to experience joy, heartbreak, first times and new adventures.\nCollege freaks me out, but you know what scares me more ? I must leave my life inside a comfort zone. It's a big, bright and beautiful world, and I think it's finally time for me to walk in it with the confidence at this time, I'll be doing it right.",
