After arriving in New York, he went into a cafeteria   in Manhattan to get something to eat.He sat down at a table and waited for someone to take his order . Of course nobody did. Finally, a woman with a plate full of food sat down opposite him and told him how a cafeteria worked.\n\"Start out at the end,\" she said, \"Just go along the line and choose what you want. At the other end they'll tell you how much you have to pay.\"\n\"I soon learned how everything works in America.\" the grandfather told my friend. \"Life is like a cafeteria here. You can get anything you want only if you are willing to pay the money. You can even get success, but you'll never get _ if you wait for someone to bring it to you. You have to get up and get it by yourself.\"",
