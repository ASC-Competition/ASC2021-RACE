If people meet them, they will come down in great quantities to bite and kill, sucking blood and flesh through the wounds they cause.\nIn June, 1966, a boy named Marl Andre who went into the mountains in search of butterfly specimens   was killed by these butterflies.

The boy struggled and cried as he tried to free himself from their attack. Finally he fell senseless to the ground.
