  "article": "Mark felt that it was time for him to take part in his community activities, so he went to the neighborhood meeting after work. The city councilman  was leading a discussion about the decreasing life quality. The neighborhood faced many problems.\nMark looked at the charts taped to the walls. There are charts for crime, parking problems, and for problems in vacant buildings. People were supposed to suggest solutions to the councilman.\nIt was too much for Mark. \"The problems are too big,\" he thought. He turned to the man next to him and said, \"I think this is a waste of my time. Nothing I could do would make a difference here.\"\nMark thought some more on his way to the bus stop. \"People should just take care of themselves,\" he decided. \"That's enough to do. I can't take on all the problems of the world.\"\nAs he neared the bus stop, Mark saw a woman carrying a grocery bag and a baby. She was trying to unlock her car, but she didn't have a free hand. As Mark got closer, her other child, a little boy, suddenly _ into the street. The woman tried to reach for him, but as she moved, her bag shifted and groceries started to fall out. Mark ran to take the boy's arm and led him back to his mother. Then he picked up the groceries while the woman smiled in relief. \"Thanks!\" she said. \"You have got great timing!\"\n\"Just being neighborly,\" Mark said. As he rode home, he glanced at the walls of the bus. On one of them was \"Small acts of kindness add up.\" Mark smiled and thought, \" Maybe that's a good place to start.\"",
