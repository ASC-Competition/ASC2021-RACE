  "article": "Do you know how to write an English letter? It is different from the Chinese letter. When we write a letter in English, we should write the date on the top of the right corner. Sometimes we write the _  ---the number of the house and the names of the street, city and country. Then we can begin the letter at the left corner. We always use words like \"Dear sir\", \"Dear Mr/Miss/Mrs ...\"to begin the writing. At the end of the letter, we usually use expressions as \"Yours\", \"Yours ever\" or \"Yours sincerely\". Then sign the writer's name.\nIt is also different to write an English envelope. You should write your name and address on the top of the left corner and write the receiver's in the middle or on the bottom of the right corner.",
