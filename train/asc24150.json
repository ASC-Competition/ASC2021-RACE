  "article": "On Saturday Patrick woke up with a little shock, knowing that this was a special day. For a moment he couldn't think exactly why, and then, with an excited flutter of his stomach, he remembered. At ten o'clock today he was going to find out the final result of the programme called Super Brain. He got dressed more carefully than usual, went downstairs and turned on the TV. Quickly he switched channels. Cartoons, cartoons, advertisements, man talking, snow, snow... and still nothing at all on Channel 8.\n\"Patrick, turn it off, darling, if you're going to watch.\" Judith walked past with the newspaper under her arm and her eyes half closed. She headed for the kitchen. Patrick turned off the TV and followed.\n\"What's for breakfast, Mum?\"\n\"We will see,\" Judith said in a low voice, turning on the electric kettle  . She looked sleepily at him and smiled. \"You look nice, darling,\" She said. \"You're all ready. But we can't go till eight-thirty at the earliest, you know. Nothing will be open till then.\"\nPatrick's stomach seemed to feel a little sick. \"We aren't going out, are we?\" He asked. Judith began to make the tea. \"Don't say you've forgotten!\" she said, \"I promised you, last Saturday. Your new trainers, remember?\"\n\"Oh--oh, but I can't go out this morning, Mum. There's something I've got to watch on TV. At ten o'clock. I've got to! My trainers will be all right for another week.\" Patrick said with excitement, looking quite worried.\nJudith faced him, hands on hips, \"Patrick,\" she said with great dislike, \"it's all organized.\"",
