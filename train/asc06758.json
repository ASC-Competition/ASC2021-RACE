  "article": "A taxi driver taught me a million dollar lesson in customer satisfaction and expectation. Inspiring speakers charge thousands of dollars to give his kind of training to business managers and staff. It cost me only a$12 taxi ride. \nI had flown into Dallas just for the purpose of calling on a client. Time was important and my plan included a quick turn-around trip from and back to the airport. A clean taxi pulled up. \nThe driver rushed to open the passenger door for me and made sure I was comfortably seated before he closed the door. As he got in the driver's seat, he mentioned that the neatly folded Wall Street Journal next to me was for my use. He then showed me several tapes and asked me what type of music I would enjoy.\nWell! I looked around for a \"Watching Camera!\" Wouldn't you? I could not believe the service I was receiving! I took the opportunity to say, \"Obviously you take great pride in your work. You must have a story to tell.\"\n\"You bet,\" he replied, \"I used to be in Commercial America. But I got tired of that, thinking my best would never be good enough. I decided to find my right position in life, somewhere I could feel proud of being the best I could be. I knew I would never be a rocket scientist, but I love driving cars, being of service and feeling like I have done a full day's work and done it well. I evaluated my personal property and, I became a taxi driver! One thing I know for sure is that to be good in my business I can simply just meet the expectations of my passengers. However, to be great in my business, I have to go beyond the customers' expectations! I like both the sound and the return of being 'great' better than just getting by on average. \"\nDid I tip him without hesitation? You bet! Commercial America's loss is the traveling folk's friend. \nThe taxi driver taught me a great life lesson: Go an extra mile when providing any service to others. And there is no good or bad job and you can make any job good.",
