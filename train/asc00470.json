  "article": "As weather cools across the United States, a growing number of Americans visit farms. They harvest fruits, enjoy hay wagon rides and walk in the fields. These people are called \"agri-tourists.\" They improve the economy of rural areas and help farmers increase their profits.\nSchool children are walking in a corn field _ . The corn is cut into tricky passageways that make it difficult to find a way out. The children are from Yorktown Elementary School in Bowie Maryland. They have traveled to Montpelier Farms in Prince George's County which is also in Maryland. The farm is about 40 kilometers from The White House.\nDebbie Pierson is the student's teacher. \"We go on these kind of field trips so that the children will have a hands-on experience of what it's like to be on a farm,\" Pierson said.\nIn Loudoun County Virginia, there are farms where grapes are grown for use in making wine. Many of the farms let people visit, and drink the wine that is made there. Bill Hatch owns the Zephaniah Farm Vineyard. He holds wine tastings in his home. \"We are doubling the number of visitors to our farm every year. We have an average of 250 people on a weekend,\" Hatch said.\nAs more people visit farms, more farmers are adding activities in which visitors can take part.\nMalcolm Baldwin owns WeatherLea Farm and Vineyard in Loudoun County. Six years ago, he began letting people be married at his farm. They can also sleep at the farm overnight. Mr. Baldwin says the money he makes from these activities let him keep his small farm operating. \"But without the animals, and without the vines, the wedding business wouldn't be as profitable  , because people like to see the vines. They like to see the animals and without which I don't think this will be a popular place,\" Baldwin said.",
