  "article": "It is amazing to note that the Internet is still such a new device,and yet it is one of the fastest and most powerful media tools. But think about it for a moment. On the Internet,a big online company can be run by only two guys in their garage. So it is only reasonable then,that people shopping online would be a little _ of the security levels.\nInternet giants such as Microsoft knew consumer confidence was the key to getting virtual  shopping off the ground,and they work hard to make people feel safe to shop online.\nCredit card companies,too,quickly saw the potential for online shopping,and have installed things like online shopping insurance for people. If you ever have a problem with your online credit purchases,many credit card companies will happily refund  your money and then set their claws on the company that wronged you. Now that's buying power!\nThere are other bonuses for online shoppers,of course. No lineups,for one. No annoying mall shopping carts with broken wheels and kids crying because their parents won't get them what they want.\nWhen shopping online,consumers can sit down,have a coffee,and wear their slippers,not having to worry about their hair or parking,and just clicking through sale after sale. Comparison shopping couldn't be any easier. And thanks to courier companies  getting in on the act,you never need to wait longer than a day or two to get those all important purchases delivered right to your door.\nNo wonder so many companies are shaking their heads at traditional advertising and instead looking to the\"virtual\" world to attract online shoppers.",
