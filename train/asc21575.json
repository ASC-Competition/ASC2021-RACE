So he put an ad in the newspaper. \"Wanted-the greatest gift for my mother.\"\nAbout a week before his mother's birthday a man came to his office. He brought a big bird.\n\"This bird.\" the man said, \"can speak ten languages and sing some pop songs.\"\n\"Really?  I'd like to listen to it,\" Bill said.\nThe man made the bird talk in French and tell a joke in Japanese. Then the bird sang a beautiful song. Bill was very happy and paid nine thousand dollars for the bird.
