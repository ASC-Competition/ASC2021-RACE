  "article": "Beethoven   was born in a small city near the Rhine in Germany. His father always drank and his mother was a maid  . They lived a poor life.\nBeethoven was a talented   child in music. People at that time thought he was as clever as Mozart. His father wanted to make money from his talent, so he told him to practice and play all the time. If he didn't do that, his father would be angry with him and beat him.\nBeethoven was very short and ugly. He couldn't hear well from the age of 22 and later he heard nothing, but all these unhappy things didn't make him dislike music. He began to write sonatas   at 12, and later he became a great musician.\nHis life was so short that he didn't leave many works. But people think he was one of the best musicians in the world.\n,A, B, C, D,.",
