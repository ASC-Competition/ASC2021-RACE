  "article": "As we know, it is very important that a firm should pay attention to the training of its staff as there exist many weak points in its various departments. Staff training must have a purpose, which I defined  when a firm considers its training needs, which are in turn based on job descriptions and job specifications.\nA job description should give details of the performance that is required for a particular job, and a job specification should give information about the behaviour, knowledge and skills that are expected of an employee who works in it. When all of this has been collected, it is possible to make a training specification. This specifies that the training department must teach for the successful performance of the job, and also the best methods to use in the training period.\nThere are many different training methods, and there are advantages and disadvantages of all of them. Successful training performances depend on an understanding of the difference between learning about skills and training in using them. It is frequently said that  learning about skills takes place \"off the job\" in classroom, but training in using these skills takes place \"on the job,\" by means of such activities as practice in the workshop.\nIt's always difficult to evaluate the costs of a training programme. The success of such a programme depends not only on the methods used but also on the quality of the staff who do the training. The evaluation of management training is much more complex than that.",
