  "article": "Amy Pankratz spent a few nights in the hospital with her daughter, Isabella, who caught a bad flu. \"Lying in bed beside Isabella, I could hear the cries of children in pain, \"says Amy. \"It completely broke my heart.\"\nWhen Isabella was getting well and could leave her room, she wore her prized possession--a \"superhero cape \" Amy had sewn to encourage her--and walked into the hallway. The pink cape was an instant hit with the other young patients, who were doing exercise around the nursing station. \"Then, all the kidswere taking turns wearing the cape, giggling, \"Amy says. \"These were some of the same children I had heard crying the night before, and here they were playing and having fun--kids just being kids!\"\nFrom that moment on, Amy began making Comfort Capes for little ones battling with serious illnesses. \"I felt God presenting an opportunity, \"she says. \"I hoped Comfort Capes can help these kids feel brave, to lift some of the fear away. \"\nSince then, Amy has made and donated more than 5, 000 capes in the United States. Amy usually pays for materials herself, although she accepts donations.\nThe capes she makes for kids in treatment are different from those her own children have. Before Amy starts to sew she learns what image or character the little boy or girl connects with. \"I choose the pattern, color and theme specially for each child,\" explains Amy.\nWhen she is not sewing, Amy is raising awareness of childhood cancers and looking into ways to get Comfort Capes to more kids who need them, \"If a cape can help a child, even only for a moment, forget his illness, it's worth the time spent sewing,\" she says.",
