  "article": "An old woman went suddenly blind. She promised a doctor a lot of money if he could make her see again. \"If you fail\", she said , \" you will get nothing,\" The doctor agreed with her.\nThe doctor soon discovered what was wrong with her, but he decided not to cure her right away. Instead, each time he visited, he secretly took some of her things. When he had taken everything that he wanted, he cured her blindness and sent her a large bill. Now when the old woman could see again she noticed that all her things had gone and she refused to pay the bill. So the doctor took her before a judge.\n\"What the doctor says is true.\" she said to the judge. \"But I say I'm not cured, because I still can't see any of the things in my house.\"\nThe old woman won her case and the doctor went away unhappily without getting his pay.",
