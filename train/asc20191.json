  "article": "In most parts of the world, many students help their school make less pollution. They join in \"environment clubs\". In an environment club, people work together to make our environment clean.\nHere are things students often do:\nTurn off the water! Do you know that some toilets can waste twenty to\nforty tons of water an hour? In a year, that would fill a small water! In environment clubs, students mend those broken toilets.\nNo-car day. On a no-car day, nobody comes to school in a car-not the students and not the teachers. Cars give pollution to our air, so remember: walk, jump, bike or run.\nUse your legs! It's lots of fun!\nNo-garbage  lunches. How much do you throw away after lunch?\nEnvironment clubs ask students to bring their lunches in bags that can be used\nagain. Every week they will choose the classes that make the least garbage\nand report them to the whole school.\nWe love our environment! Let's work together to make it clean!",
