Some beauty products can cause lasting damage that goes far below the surface of the skin.\nIn America,many people use sunlight and non-natural light to darken their skin. Health experts advise against what is called\"tanning\"because of its links to akin cancer.

So,she made\"This Color That Bothers Me\",a film about the subject of skin lightening. She said,\"I used the most shocking images so that women would see the dangers.
