  "article": "Mr. Robinson never went to see a dentist, because he was afraid , but then his teeth began aching a lot, and he had to see a dentist. The dentist did a lot of work in his mouth for a long time. On the last day Mr. Robinson asked the dentist, \"How much is all the work going to cost ?\" \"Twenty-five dollars,\" said the dentist. But he didn't ask him for the money. After a month Mr. Robinson phoned the dentist and said, \"You haven't asked me for any money for your work.\" \"Oh,\" the dentist answered, \"I never ask a gentleman for money.\" \"Then how do you live?\" Mr. Robinson asked. \"Most gentlemen pay me quickly, the dentist said, \"but some don't. I wait for my money for two months, and then I say, 'That man is not a gentleman,' and then I ask him for my money.",
