But in American, most shoppers enjoy shopping in the shopping malls.\nA mall is a group of many shops. There you can buy clothes, furniture, and everything you need. Shopping malls provide parking for your cars. Usually, the mall is under one roof so the shoppers do not get cold or wet from rain, wind, or snow.\nAfter shopping, you may get tired. You can walk into the sitting-room for a short rest. If you go into the dinning rooms in the malls, you can have a good meal. Now more and more Americans like to go shopping there.",
