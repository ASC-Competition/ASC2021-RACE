  "article": "Nowadays, computer games are becoming more and more popular in many cities and towns.\nA lot of small shops along busy streets have been made into small game houses in order to get more money. These places are always crowded with people, especially young boys.\nIn the computer game houses, people  spend  a lot of money competing  with the machines. It's hard for one to win the computer, but one can make  progress after trying again and again. People have a kind of gambling psychology when they play computer games. The more they lose, the more they want to win. When class is over, the school boys run to the nearby computer game houses. Little by little , they forget all about their lessons and fall far behind others. Some of them can get enough money from their parents. But some of them are not lucky enough to get the money. They begin to take away other students' money and become thieves.",
