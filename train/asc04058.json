  "article": "Young people frequently say that they want to exercise, but they just can't find the time.\nThe solution just might be in-office interval training.\nRecent studies show that very short but intense exercise rapidly builds and maintains fitness and health, even when the workout is only a few minutes long.\nWork the stairs\nYou can complete an excellent, effective -- and very brief -- workout in an office stairwell, says Martin Gibala, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Canada and an expert on interval training.\nFor a study that he and his colleagues presented earlier this year, they asked 12 out-of-shape women in their 20s to warm up for two minutes by slowly walking up and down stairs in a campus office building.\nThey completed three of these abbreviated stair workouts per week for six weeks.\nBy the end, their aerobic fitness had improved substantially, the researchers reported, by about as much as if they had been running or cycling each week for hours.\nFidget your way to fitness.\nParents and teachers may once have urged you to sit still, but wiggling, tapping your toes, standing briefly, and otherwise fidgeting as much as possible at your desk is in fact good for your body.\nIn one recent study, college students showed healthier blood flow in their lower legs if they fidgeted than if they did not.\nEven better, a 2008 study found that among office workers, those who frequently fidgeted burned as many as 300 calories more each day than those who resolutely stayed still.",
