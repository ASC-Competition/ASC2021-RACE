  "article": "Almost 80% of the Americans have stated their opposition to cloning pet animals such as cats and dogs, yet companies still try to make a business out of selling cloned pets. Pet cloning has been promoted as a way to \"bring back\" or \"copy\" a beloved companion animal. However, studies have shown that cloning remains an experimental technology with many failures.\nBehind each lovely picture of a cloned cat or dog lie hundreds of animals that were kept in lab cages, receiving bad treatment to produce just that one cloned animal. For all that, you end up with a cloned animal who is unlikely to appear like the original physically or behaviorally and may experience serious health problems. Also, while pet cloning companies are charging customers up to $150,000 for a cloned pet, millions of homeless animals of the same species are available in US animal shelters for around $100. Unfortunately, most of these animals are killed for lack of adopting homes.\nWith No Pet Cloning campaign, the American Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS) tries to protect both animals and people from harm. They campaigned until the US companies that sold cloned animals closed their doors. First it was Genetic Savings & Clone Inc. and then it was BioArts International.\nWhen BioArts was closed, its owner, Lou Hawthorne, finally had to _ the problems of pet cloning. According to Hawthorne, he has seen numerous failures during his pet cloning attempts, \"One clone----which was supposed to be black and white----was born greenish-yellow where it should have been white (we still have no good explanation for how that happened).\"\nThe AAVS is educating the public about the animal suffering and is seeking regulation of cloning activities. They will continue to take the lead in protecting animals from the threats of pet cloning.",
