  "article": "We feel it important to start reading to your child right from the start -the younger the better! With little ones(children from birth to 4)it is very important to read and reread books.Starting early makes the job of _ (for you will be teaching your child how to listen) easier,as it helps to develop an early love of the written and spoken word.\nWe believe that you should read aloud to your child at least once every day .Set a special reading time during the day or evening when you can settle down  and enjoy a book,without interruption.For most families,reading aloud at bedtime is a common practice.\nWe understand that it can be quite discouraging to read to a child who takes no interest .Take heart! Learning to listen takes experience .The more you read ,the more your child will learn to sit for a story .Children have a natural development of responses to your reading .By the time your child reaches6-7 months,she/he is attracted by the book in your hand ,and would like to test it out by using it as a chew toy.This is natural! By one year,your child is learning to listen and talk about the pages,often shouting out things she/he recognizes.Encourage this! And at the onset  of walking ,you have your biggest challenge yet.your child  is always on the go.you need to set your reading time for a time in the day when your child is preparing to settle down.This means bedtime.Remember,it is your right and duty to teach your child about the power of books.Of course ,it doesn't happen overnight,but the returns are great!",
