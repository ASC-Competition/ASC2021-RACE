He's the second youngest ever to win a world ranking title !\nIn the final, Ding beat the world champion 9:5. He came from far behind to win. \n\"I didn't feel nervous because I just looked at it as a practice match,\" said Ding. \"I was able to learn from the other players.\"\nDing doesn't talk much. Besides snooker, he hasn't many outside interests. He says he doesn't want anyone to beat him at snooker. \nHe has been in Britain since he was 16. He can play with the world's best players there. He practices many hours a day. \n\"Every game is so different for me. I have to think a lot before I win. That's why I enjoy snooker so much,\" he said.",
