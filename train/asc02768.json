  "article": "He may not have an \"S\" across his chest but this dog is most certainly a hero.\nHarley, who was rescued from a puppy mill four years ago, was named the American Humane Association's 2015 American Hero Dog. Harley, who is missing an eye and has other medical issues from his time at the mill, is now a \"spokes-dog\" against puppy mills. He serves as the adorable furry face of the\"Harley to the Rescue\"campaign, which raises funds for the National Dog Mill Rescue, according to a press release.\nThe pup was rescued back in 2011 and adopted by Rudi and her husband, Dan. \"It was just four years ago that he was pulled from the cage in the puppy mill and left to die,\" Harley's owner, Rudi, said during the awards show at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles this past weekend, according to Today. com. \"We never would have ever thought he would live this long and make such a difference for so many puppies. \"\nThe dog was one of eight finalists up for the American Hero Dog and was chosen as the winner through public votes. The finalists all won $ 1,500 to be donated to one of American Humane Association' s charity partners, with Harley receiving another  $ 5 ,000 to go toward his charity partner, New Leash On Life.\nAccording to the release, Harley spent 10 years at the puppy mill, and endured rough  treatment there,  which led to his many medical issues.  He lost his eye as a result of his cage being power-washed with him inside.\nThe dog isn't just the face of his campaign, he also goes on rescue missions and makes public appearances at events and schools to raise awareness for puppy mills.\nThis incredible work is all due to the dog' s fighting spirit.  That spirit is allowing him now to be the voice for dogs who cannot speak for themselves and give everybody hope that tomorrow's going to be a better day.",
