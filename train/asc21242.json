  "article": "One day an old man is selling  a big elephant . A young man comes to the elephant and begins to look at it slowly. The old man goes up to him and says in his ear, \"Don't say anything about the elephant before I sell it. Then I will give you twenty dollars.\" \"All right,\" says the young man. After the old man sells the elephant, he gives the young man twenty dollars and says, \"Now, can you tell me how you found  the elephant's bad ears ?\"\"I didn't find the bad ears,\" says the young man. \"Then why are you looking at the elephant slowly?\" asks the old man. The young man answers, \"Because I didn't see an elephant before, and I want to know what it looks like.\"",
