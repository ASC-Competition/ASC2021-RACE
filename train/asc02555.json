  "article": "It was on her 14th birthday that her first book ,In the Forest of the Night, was accepted for publication. It was a huge success gaining the attention of millions of young readers. At 16, her second novel,Demon in My View, also reached the bookstores. Several books later, the teenage author still works away in her room, surrounded by shelves full of dark tales about vampires  and witches. Amelia Atwater - Rhodes is widely seen as America's finest teen writer and was named one of Teen People's \"20 Teens Who Will Change the World.\"\nBorn in 1984, she began making up stories when she was about three years old. \"I never stopped and said, 'I want to write',\" Amelia remembers. \"I loved stories and created stories before I was old enough to know how to write them down.\"\nIn her family, reading was basic and fun. \"My parents encouraged me to read -- and to read anything I wanted, so long as I was reading,\" she said. \"They never restricted what I read. Later, when I started writing, they never criticized what I did or said I was 'too young'. They never said it was impossible for me to achieve what I have.\"\nIn her short but successful career, Amelia has tried different styles. But vampires were the first characters to really come alive in her work. From _ she has developed a whole world, one which she always enjoys learning more about.\nAs a published teen writer, Amelia's advice to other teens who dream of being authors is: just do it! \"I believe anything is possible. Don't give up your dreams just because you fear failure. Getting a book published is difficult, but if I can do it, others can too. \"",
