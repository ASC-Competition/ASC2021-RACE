  "article": "Ellen Parker was worried about her health. She could not walk very quickly and it was difficult for her to climb stairs . She was soon out of breath. \n\"I think I had better go to the doctor, \" she thought.\nShe went to the doctor and told him her problem.\n\"I'm not at all surprised, \"he said. \"It's obvious  what your problem is.\"\nHe examined her and then gave her some advice.\"If you don't do what I say, Mrs. Parker,\" he said. \"You will have a heart attack . It could kill you.\"\nEllen was very worried as she left the doctor's. She knew that she had to take his advice but that would not be easy and it would take time.\nThe next day she went shopping. The first shop she went into was a butcher's shop .\n\"I'd like ten pounds of steak  , please,\" she said.\n\"Certainly, madam,\" the butcher  answered and went into the cold room and found a large piece of steak. He brought the huge piece of meat back into the shop and placed it on the scale .\n\"That's just ten pounds,\" he said.\n\"That's big enough,\" Mrs. Parker said.\nThe butcher worked out  the price.\n\"At $ 4.99 a pound that will be $ 49.90, please. Would you like me to cut it into small pieces for you?\"\n\"Oh, I don't want to buy the meat,\" Mrs. Parker said.\n\"If you don't want to buy it,\" the butcher said angrily, \"Why did you ask me to get it for you?\"\n\"My doctor told me that I am overweight  and have to lose ten pounds. I wanted to see what ten pounds of flesh looked liked.\"",
