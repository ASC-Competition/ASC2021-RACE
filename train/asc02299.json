  "article": "Have you ever listened to young children talking in the playground? They are always boasting. They say things like, \"My Dad's car is bigger than your Dad's,\" and \"My Mom is smarter than yours.\" They particularly like to boast about their families.\nThere were three little boys, Harry, Ted and Gavin, who were always boasting. Gavin was the worst. Everything about his family was always the best or the biggest or the most expensive.\nWhatever the others said, he could always go on better. One day when they were walking to\nschool, Harry said, \"My father had a bath twice a week,\" Ted spoke next. \"That's nothing,\" he said. \"Having a bath twice a week is dirty. My father has a bath every day, sometimes twice a day.\" Ted looked at Gavin. Now it was his turn. But what could he say? \"This time,\" Ted thought, \"I'm going to win.\" Gavin didn't know what to say. He couldn't say that his father had a bath three times a day. That was silly. He walked on in silence. Ted smiled at Harry, and Harry smiled back. They were sure that for once they had beaten Gavin. They reached the school gates. Still Gavin said nothing. \"We've won,\" Ted said to Harry, but he spoke too soon. On the way home, Gavin said, \"My Dad is so clean that he doesn't have to bathe at all.\"",
