  "article": "In October 2012, I joined an organization to volunteer to work in Thailand. When I arrived in Thailand, I thought I would be taken to an orphanage . However, I was told that I had to go to the place where I would live by train alone. And then I knew that my job was to teach English in a school instead of working at an orphanage.\nThe next day I went to the school and met the kids I would teach. In the classroom, the kids looked at me, saying nothing. No one could speak English. But from their eyes, I knew they were really nervous to learn English, It seemed like a big challenge for me, but that was just what I wanted.\nAlthough I loved the kids and the challenge, my life in Thailand was quite hard at first. I was alone and there was nobody I could talk to. However, I didn't give up. If I had been afraid of difficulties, I wouldn't have traveled all the way from England to Thailand to be a volunteer. Little by little, I learned some Thai and started to fall in love with Thailand. Every time I saw the kids' pleasure of learning English, I was happy and felt that what I was doing was really _ .\nNow I'm working in a hospital in Thailand. If you also want to be a volunteer like me, don't worry too much about the food or the place where you live. After all, as a volunteer, the most important thing is to help people who need help!",
