  "article": "How many hours does it take to be fluent in English?\nThere are plenty of people in the UK for whom even basic English is a problem. According to the survey, 726,000 people in England and Wales said they could not speak English well, and another 138,000 said they did not speak it at all.\nLing, 40,who arrived five years ago from China, found it difficult to learn English. \" When I came here l was pregnant and so I was at home for the next three years. It took me longer to learn as l was very busy with the children.\" Eventually she was able to begin taking classes and now speaks good conversational English. But even with classes, it can be a long process to pick up the language.\nAge is the most important factor in language acquisition, says Mila Vulchanova, professor of linguistics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. \"There is a sensitive period in language learning, which is biologically determined, with an onset at birth and a decline around puberty. So the younger the immigrant, the better. Since this decline is only gradual, teenagers are at an advantage over adults.\" he says.\nThere are a number of systems for grading English. The government expects immigrants to reach \"ESOL Entry 3\" or \"B1 level\" in Scotland, before they can be granted citizenship. It's equivalent  to being able to hold a confident conversation and-it might take 360 hours of study to achieve.\nGeorge Osborne said in June following the spending review that welfare claimants who don't speak English will have their benefits cut if they fail to attend language courses.\nHuan Japes, deputy chief executive of English UK, a trade body for language colleges, says a rule of thumb is 360 hours-120 hours for each of three stages-to get to the standard the government expects benefit claimants to reach.\nBut many of the people who attend courses are visiting students rather than people settling in the UK. Immigrants tend to have very varied levels of education.\n\" Using 120 hours( for each stage of English fluency) is a rather traditional approach to course book learning,\" says Dr Elaine Boyd, head of English language at Trinity College London. \"If someone is really highly motivated, they can learn really quickly. It's common for children under the age of 11 to be very immersed and be fluent in about six months. \"",
