  "article": "I will be traveling to Australia as a Student Ambassador with People to People. People to People arranges for American students to travel all around the world to learn about other cultures, and to help others understand American culture. The program was founded by former President Dwight D. Eisenhower to promote peace through understanding.\nI had to put in many hours of special work to get to this point. First, a teacher nominated   me, and then I attended an informational meeting about the program. The application process included an interview, and finally, I was accepted.\nThat's when the hard work really began. In addition to attending monthly meetings to prepare for the big trip, my parents encouraged my twin sister Beth (also participating in the program) and me to raise $ 2,000 each to help pay for the cost. And so the fund-raising began. We did everything from selling candy bars to selling an old car to decorating people's mailboxes during the holiday season. We also babysat, washed cars, held a yard sale, and washed windows. After months of hard work I had raised a total of $2319.87! Combined, Beth and I raised over $ 4500.00!\nNow I have a problem-packing. Yes, I know it sounds unimportant, but my suitcase seems to have shrunk   as I placed my belongings inside. According to airline regulations  , a suitcase can be no larger than 54 inches and weigh no more than 44 pounds. For a person who likes to wear a different outfit every day, packing all my clothes into such a small space seemed an impossible task. However, I have lessened my load and my suitcase which started out weighting overweight now checks in at a mere 36. Apart from a slightly bloated   carry-on bag, my luggage is definitely manageable.\nI doubt that I will not get much sleep tonight because I am so excited! I know that what lies ahead is going to be the trip of lifetime!",
