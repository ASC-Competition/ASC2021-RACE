  "article": "\"There's no point in talking with you: you don't understand me. You don't even know me.\" A teen spits these words at a parent, who is hurt and annoyed. How can her own child say these things? She's worked hard getting to know him, learning to read his feelings from his voice and gestures. How can her own child now say to her, \"You don't know who I really am\"?\nNothing shakes a parent's confidence as much as the starting of a child's adolescence. The communication that has flowed easily through words, glance and touch becomes a minefield \nRecent discoveries that the human brain undergoes specific and dramatic development during adolescence offer new \"explanations\" of teen behavior, particularly of the impulsiveness  of teenagers. During this development, there may be too many synapses  for the brain to work efficiently, the mental capacities of decision-making, judgment and control are not mature until the age of twenty-four.\nAn old explanation is that anger hormones account for the apparently unreasonable moodiness  of teens. Though hormones do play a role in human feelings, the real task of adolescence, and the real cause of the unrest, is the uncertainty of teenagers about who they are, alongside their eagerness to establish a sense of identity.\nThis involves self-questioning, self-discovery and self-development across a range of issues, including sex, faith, intellect and relationships. A sense of who we are is not a mere luxury; without it we feel worthless. A teen often looks upon his or her friends sa models: \" I don't know who I am, but I know who he is, I'll be like him,\" is the underlying thought. Parents also become such mirrors: teens want that mirror to reflect back to them the vividness and clarity they themselves do not feel.\nArguments with parents can often be understood in this context. While those common teenager-parent quarrels, which explode every few days, are often over small things such as homework, housework, and respect; a teenager's real focus is on a parent's recognition of his maturity and capability and human value. \" No, you can't go out tonight,\" implies that a parent you got your keys?\" or \"Do you have enough money for the bus?\" are questions that can be easily accepted if asked by a concerned friend, but awaken a teen's own doubts if asked by a parent. Feeling the need to distinguish himself from the kid who can't remember to take his lunch, his keys or his money, he blames the parent for reminding him of the child-self still living within him. What my research shows is that quarreling witj your teen doesn't necessarily mean you have a bad relationship. The quality of teenager-parent relationship has several measures.",
