  "article": "Do you know Xishuangbana? It's a very beautiful place. It lies in Yunnan. The Dai people live there. Their homes are wonderful. The houses are very big and have long legs to hold   them up. Sometimes those legs are over two metres tall.\nIt can be very hot in Yunnan. But the Dai people do not need air conditioners   to keep cool. Their houses usually have two floors. One half of the second floor is the living room. The living room has a balcony. The other half of the second floor is their bedroom. There is a long corridor   between the living room and the bedroom.\nYou must always take off your shoes before you go into a Dai family's house. They like to keep their houses clean. The bed is made of bamboo  . The family's tables, chairs and cupboards are all made of bamboo too. It often rains in Yunnan. Pigs and chickens live on the first floor, because it is a good place to stay _ .",
