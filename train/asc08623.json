  "article": "No one could have failed to be moved had he watched the live televised volleyball game between the Chinese and Cuban women's teams. As we sat before the television set, with our eyes fixed on the screen, we experienced every kind of feeling. When the two teams played neck and neck, we were on pins and needles, anxious as to what would come next, and when our team fell behind our hearts were in our mouths. Watching the game between those two teams is not only a matter of great joy. For more than that it provides food for thought. Just see how the Chinese women won the game --by their co --operation  , by their excellent skill, their effort and strong will. A Chinese saying goes, \"When two competent opponents   meet, the strong --minded one will win. \"This is the spirit of the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team. If every Chinese showed some of the spirit, never losing heart in times of difficulty and remaining clear --minded in times of advantage  , then our nation would stand in the vanguard   of the world family of nations, just as the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team has done, is doing and will do.",
