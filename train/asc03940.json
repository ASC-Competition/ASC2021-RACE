  "article": "Jamie Oliver, a lively Britain guy, loves to share his secrets. In his first television show,The Naked Chef, Oliver taught everyone to make simple but delicious food. In Jamie's Kitchen, he taught young people how to prepare meals. His next show,Jamie's School Dinners, is about changing the food that students eat.\nOliver saw that some schools in Britain were serving junk food--food that is easy to eat but unhealthy. Although it can be delicious, junk food is not very good for children. It is sometimes bad for their health, because it doesn't give them the energy they need at school. They sometimes can't think well or feel down, and they sometimes put on weight.\nSome of the junk food that Oliver wants to change is canned spaghetti, chicken nuggets, French fries, soda, and muffins. He encourages schools to serve fresh and health meats, vegetables and fruits. He helps the school cooks to make healthy dinners without junk food.\nPeople liked Oliver's idea of bringing quality food to schools. Thousands enjoyed his television show. But Oliver wanted them to do more than just watch. At hisFeed Me Betterwebsites, he collected over 270,000 signatures   from people. Oliver sent these signatures to British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Then Blair promised to help change the school kitchens, teach school cooks to make healthy food, and spend more on school dinners. Thanks to Jamie Oliver, my children will be able to enjoy more healthy meals at school.",
