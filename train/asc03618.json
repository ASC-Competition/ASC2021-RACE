  "article": "Michael Jordon is the greatest basketball player of all time. Once he was making a television commercial  . All Michael needed to do in the advertisement was to miss a shot.\nFor Michael, this was difficult. He had conditioned himself to succeed whenever he was throwing the ball. Every time he threw a basketball, it went in. Every time he tried to miss a shot, he failed. In total, it took him over 20 attempts   before he missed a shot.\nFor Michael, success is a strong habit. He had formed a habit that was so strong that it took him a lot of time to break it and \"fail\".\nJust like drinking, smoking and collecting things, success is also a habit. The only thing is, it is much more effective!\nLike all habits, once it is established  , it is difficult to break.\nMany people think that success is difficult to maintain  . They feel that it will be hard work and will need too much action and focus. The truth is that it is simply a habit, and as easy to maintain as any other habit.\nSpend some time making success a habit in your life. Once you have developed it, it is not something you will want to change again. Then, the only thing you will fail at is failing.",
