  "article": "There are about 7,000,000 people in London. London is one of the big cities in the world. London is famous for many things. People from all over the world come to see the famous buildings. There is a famous clock called Big Ben, too.\nLike many big cities, the _ is very busy in London. When the work hours begin, over 1,000,000 people use the London underground , but there are still too many buses and cars on the streets. The air isn't clean.\nFor me, the best things about London are the parks. There are five in the middle of the city. But my children's favorite is playing in Hamleys, the biggest toy  shop in the world.\n,,.",
