  "article": "\"I never did hate the Yankees . All that I hated was the war...\" That's how my great-aunt Bettie began her story. I heard it many times as a child, whenever my family visited Aunt Bettie in the old house in Berryville,   Virginia.\nBettie Van Metre had good reason to hate the Civil War. Her brother was killed at Gettysburg, and her husband, James, a Confederate officer, was taken prisoner and sent to an unknown prison camp somewhere.\nOne day in late September, Dick came to Bettie reporting that he had found a wounded Union soldier in a farmhouse half a mile away from the Van Metre home. When talking about her first sight of the man in the blood-spotted blue uniform, she always used the same words. _ She went out into the cool air, trying not to be sick at the thought of that smashed right hand, that missing left leg.\nThe man's papers Bettie found in the farmhouse showed his identity: Henry Bedell, 30 years old. She knew that she should report the presence of this Union officer to the Confederate army, but she wouldn't. This is how she explained it: \"I kept wondering if he had a wife somewhere, hoping, and not knowing--just as I was. It seemed to me that the only thing that mattered was to get her husband back to her.\"\nSlowly, patiently, skillfully, Aunt Bettie fanned the spark of life in Henry Bedell. Of drugs or medicines she had almost none. And she was not willing to take any from the few supplies at the Confederate hospital. But she did the best she could with what she had.\nThe October nights in the valley grew cold. With the help of Dick and his wife, she moved the Union officer at night, to a hidden room above the warm kitchen of her own home. But the next day, Bedell had a high fever. Knowing that she must get help, she went to her family doctor, Graham Osborne. Dr. Osborne examined Bedell and said, \"there was little hope unless proper medicines could be found.\"\n\"I'll get them from the Yankees at Harpers Ferry.\" Bettie said. The doctor told her that Harpers Ferry was almost 20 miles away. Even if she reached them, the Yankees would never believe her. \"I'll take proof,\" Bettie said. She found a blood-spotted paper bearing the official War Department seal  . \"When I show it, they'll believe me.\"\nEarly the next morning she set off with a list of medical items. For five hours she drove, stopping only to rest her horse. The sun was almost down when she finally stood before the general at  Harpers Ferry. The general listened, but did not believe her. \"Madam,\" he said, \"Bedell's death was reported to us.\" \"He's alive,\" Bettie insisted. \"But he won't be much longer unless he has the medicines on that list.\" \"Well,\" the general turned to a junior officer, \"see that Mrs. Van Metre gets the supplies.\"\nWith the medicines, Bedell gradually recovered. Ten days later he was walking with sticks. \"I'd better go back as soon as possible.\" Bedell told Bettie. So it was arranged that Dick should help Bettie deliver Bedell to Harpers Ferry in his wagon. Bedell lay down in a box filled with hay, his rifle and sticks beside him.\nAt Harpers Ferry, the soldiers were amazed when the Union officer with the missing leg rose from his hay-filled box. Bedell told the story to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who wrote a letter of thanks to Bettie and signed an order to free James Van Metre. It was arranged for Bedell to go with Bettie as she searched for her husband. Records showed that a James Van Metre had been sent to a prison camp in Ohio. Then at Fort Delaware, near the end of the line of prisoner, a tall man stepped out and walked clumsily into Bettie's arms. Bettie held him, tears streaming down her face. And Henry Bedell, standing by on his sticks, wept, too.",
