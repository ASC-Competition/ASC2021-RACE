  "article": "Late one afternoon, when a professor was walking along a country road, he saw a farmer eating his supper alone on the road before his house.\nThe professor walked up to the farmer and asked, \"Why are you eating here alone?\"\n\"Well, sir,\" answered the farmer after a short pause, \"the chimney  smokes\"\n\"That's too bad,\" said the professor. \"But it shouldn't be too difficult to fix. Let me have a look at it.\"\nAnd before the farmer could say a word, the professor was at the door. A broom  fell on his shoulder and a woman's voice shouted, \"Go away, you old rascal , or I'll kill you...\"\nThe professor left the house quickly. The farmer sat on the road looking very unhappy. The professor walked up to him and put his hand on his shoulder. \"Never mind,\" he said, \"my chimney sometimes too.\"",
