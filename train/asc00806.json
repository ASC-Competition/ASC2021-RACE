  "article": "When you put down your pens at the end of the college entrance exam, 12 hard years of study will have come to an end. Forget your studies for a while. It's time to enjoy yourselves!\nThere are many ways to celebrate this special month of graduation. You can have photos taken with your classmates and teachers, or dine out together and exchange gifts.\nHigh school students in western countries such as the United States and Canada usually have party to _ their graduation. It's to mark the time when kids turn into young men and women. After the party, teenagers either go to college or find a job. It means they will no longer depend on their parents as before.\nAs the party, boys usually dress in dinner jackets and bow ties, though many different types of formal clothes are worn. Girls traditionally wear formal dresses, or dress to shock or be noticed, in shiny or brightly colored materials.\nCommon party activities include dining, dancing, the crowing of a ball king and queen, and just talking to friends. In some cases, high school students collect funds for their class party through the four years of their high school.\nHigh schools in or near large cities may rent big rooms at expensive hotels or,to be unusual, on a pleasure boat.But often costs are out by simply using the school gym.Students make a lot of effort to decorate the gym to make the event special.The music played at the party will be the most popular kinds,like rock and hip-hop.\nSometimes teachers and parents also go to the party,but others like to go with friends,to whom they are soon going to say goodbye.",
