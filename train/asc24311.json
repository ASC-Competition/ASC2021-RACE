  "article": "Our little boy came up to his mother one evening while she was cooking supper, and handed her a piece of paper with some words written on. And this is what it said:\nFor cutting the grass in the garden $5.00\nFor cleaning up my bedroom this week $1. 00\nFor going to the store for you $0. 50\nFor baby-sitting my kid brother while you went shopping $2. 25\nFor taking out the rubbish $1. 00\nFor getting a good report card $5. 00\nTotal owed  :  $14.75\nAfter reading, his mother thought for a while. Then she picked up the pen, turned over the paper and wrote:\nFor the nine months I carried you while you were growing inside me--free\nFor the nights and days I worried about you--free\nFor the toys, clothes, food--free\nFor all the love I've given you--free\nThen with tears in his eyes, our son looked straight up at his mother and said, \"Mom, I love you. \" And he took the pen and wrote: \"PAID IN FULL\".",
