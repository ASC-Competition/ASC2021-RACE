  "article": "Children's allowance. Many children first learn the value of money by receiving an allowance . The purpose is to let them learn from experience at an age when financial (;;)mistakes are not very costly.\nIn any case, parents should make clear what the child is expected to pay for with the money. At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If so, they'll learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget . Parents are usually advised not to offer more money until the next allowance. It is to show them that a budget demands choices between spending and saving.\nMany people who have written on the subject of allowances say it is not a good idea to pay your child for work around the home. These jobs are a normal part of family life. Paying children to do extra work around the house, however, can be useful. It can even provide an understanding of how a business works.\nAllowances give children a chance to experience what they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or give it to a good cause. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require sacrifice: They have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowance can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer services to help children learn about personal finance.",
