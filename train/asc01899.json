  "article": "Thousands of hungry birds left the countryside of Britain in the bitter winter to find food and warmth in urban gardens. The move included species such as the redwing and the fieldfare, almost unknown outside rural areas\nThe hard situation of farmland birds has been revealed in the latest survey of bird populations from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds released today.\nThe redwing has an obvious stripe over the eye and a red flash on the flanks  , while the fieldfare has a grey head, a peach underbelly, and a distinctive dark band on the tail.\nGraham Madge, the society's spokesman, says, \"For many urban birdwatchers the sight of these striking species is a real treat. Many people have never imagined there being such an amazing chance.\"\n\"Frozen ground prevented them from getting food in the countryside and they have been saved from starvation in towns,\" he added.\nHe says the unusual sight this year somewhat _ the frustration felt at the suffering of small garden birds such as robins and wrens. These birds are sensitive to cold and must eat almost continuously to stay alive. Data from people who took part in the society's Big Garden Birdwatch recorded sightings in 280,000 gardens during the last weekend of January, with the goldcrest down 75 percent, the longtailed tit down 27 percent, and the coal tit down 20 percent. The study highlighted the need for food to be left out for birds during winter.\nThe redwing and the fieldfare are relatively unknown outside the eastern part of the country. The research shows, however, that they moved to the other side of the country where the climate is generally mild in winter and that many for the first time have reached Cornwall and Isles of Scilly. The number of redwing sightings was up 185 percent, those of the fieldfare 73, and of the yellowhammer 68.\nAnother surprise garden \"guest\" this year was the blackcap. This robinsized, silvergrey bird was rare in Britain 50 years ago, but increasing numbers now arrive each year from Germany and Austria.",
