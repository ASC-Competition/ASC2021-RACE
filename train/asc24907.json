Try to find out what you're worried about\nSometimes, you will know what you're worried about. Other times, you might not. Try to find it out first; if you can't, you can ask for help.\n2. Think of ways to make it better\nThere is always something you can do to help you feel less worried. Sitting there worrying is no fun and it won't solve your problem.\nGrades at school are often top worries for kids. If you're worried about grades, ask yourself these questions:\n Why are grades important? What do grades mean to me?\nHow do I get ready for class? Do I\nmy notes even when there isn't a test?\n Do I have a good place to do my homework?\n Have I tried different ways of studying?\nIf your worry is about a fight you had, you might write down all the things you could do: write a note to him or her, invite him or her to a basketball game, say sorry to him or her, etc. Once you have a list of things you could do, you can choose the one that gets your friend back.\n3. Ask for help\nWhen you're worried, it can help to find someone to talk to. You can ask your parents, friends, or teachers for help.\n,. (5)",
