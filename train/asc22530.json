  "article": "When you are in England, you must be more careful in the street because the traffic drives on the left. Before you cross the street, you must look to the right first and then left.\nIn the morning and in the evening, when people go to or come from work, the streets are very busy. Traffic is the most dangerous then.\nWhen you go by bus in England, you have to be careful, too. Always remember the traffic moves on the left. So you must be more careful, have a look first or you will go wrong.\nIn many English cities, there are big buses with two floors. You can sit on the second floor. From there you can see the city very well.",
