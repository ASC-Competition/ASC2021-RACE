Local leaders told her that the animals were not healthy and the number of reindeer was. getting too small to support the community.\nBack in the United States, Morgan Keay and a friend who had also studied inMongoliastarted an organization. They named it Itgel the Mongolian word for \"hope\".\nThe Itgel Foundation has helped bring foreign scientists to Mongoliato research and treat reindeer diseases. They also helped Tsaatan workers build a community and visitor center. The building includes guest rooms for tourists. The Tsaatan not only work as guides, they now provide services for travelers. The community works in partnership with international tour operators, who had formerly been in control of the services.\nPeople in the community designed the center, which they also own and manage. Before the visitor center was built, families earned an average of 100 dollars a year. Now Morgan Keay says the average is 3 to 4 times that. Money also goes into a community account.\nFour years ago the Tsaatan had fewer than 500 reindeer. Now the herd has already reached 900.\nMorgan Keay says the Tsaatan are becoming economically independent for the first time.\nThe Mongolian government is now considering a development plan written by the community that deals with education, health, the environment and economics.",
