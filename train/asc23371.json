Finally the expert had to agree.\nThe next morning, the gemologist put a jade   stone in the young man's hand and told him, \"Hold it!\" The expert then went about his work: cutting, weighing, and making. The big boy felt a bit strange  , but he said nothing. He just sat quietly and waited.\nThe following morning the expert again placed the jade stone in the young man's hand and told him to hold it. On the third, fourth, and fifth day the young man did the same job.\nA month went by, and the young man felt more and more boring because of holding the same stone.\nOne morning, the gemologist came and asked him to hold out his hand, he couldn't go on any longer. But just as the gemologist put the stone in his hand, he said loudly,\"This is not the same jade stone!\"\n\"You have begun to learn,\" said the gemologist with a smile.",
