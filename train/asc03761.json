  "article": "Earlier this week, I wrapped up   a 5-day trip in San Francisco. I woke up a few hours before sunrise, drove through the darkness and out of the city, hiked for 30 minutes to the top of a hill overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, and snapped  this photo. As I stood there soaking in the early morning light, I was reminded of an important lesson.\nWhen I arrived in San Francisco, I told myself, \"Just take photos as you do other things.\" My primary goal was to meet with friends and so I figured I could take pictures as we walked around the city. This resulted in exactly zero photos worth sharing. I had vague ideas like, \"I'd like to do some street photography,\" but I never went out with the intent of photographing something specific. Finally, on the last morning, I went out with the intent of capturing a specific picture and I ended up with something worth sharing. My mistake was that I assumed that because I wanted to take photos, I would end up getting a desirable result.\nHow often do you do this in your own life? We go to the gym to \"work out\" without trying to become better at something specific. We wish that we were more creative, but never work on a particular project. When you commit to a task, however, then the next step is obvious. You want to take a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge at sunrise? Next step: find a good spot. You've found a good spot? Next step: wake up early and drive there.\nThis is perhaps the most shocking thing: if box yourself in, then you'll begin to break out and achieve something greater than you ever imagined.",
