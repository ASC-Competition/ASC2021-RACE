  "article": "It started as a game.Wendy and Peter were in River Park.They watched the boats in the river and visited the zoo.They played on the slides and swings.They watched the merry-go-round,but they did not have money for a ride.They ate their sandwiches at a picnic table.Suddenly Wendy jumped up.\n\"I know what to do,\"she said.\"Look at all that junk under the tables.Let's pick it up.\"\nSo they picked up paper and empty boxes and cans.They put them in the green cans marked\"Litter\".Peter's dog Stoopy picked up some paper and ran away with it.Peter called him back and took it from him.Then they taught Stoopy to carry trash for them.They put it in the cans.They worked until there was no trash left on the picnic grounds.\nThe next day their friends Mario and Andy came to the park with them.They helped to tidy the picnic grounds again.Then they ran all over the park looking for litter.They tried to see who could find the most.After that,it was a game they played every time they came to the park.\nOne day,a man came with a camera.He watched what they were doing.He asked to take a picture for them.Then he took them all for a free ride on the merry-go-round,even Stoopy.The next day their picture was in the newspaper.It said.\"Five Litter Lifters at River Park\".After that all their friends wanted to be litter lifters.It was the beginning of a club that was a model for others to follow.",
