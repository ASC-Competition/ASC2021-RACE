  "article": "Many blind people use guide dogs to help them get safely from place to place and to warn them of danger. But what can blind people do if they are allergic  to dogs or just don't like them? For these people, they can turn to the Guide Horse Foundation.\nJanet and Don Burleson founded  the organization in 1999. They began training miniature horses to help guide blind people. Miniature horses look just like common horses, only much smaller. They are generally less than 34 inches tall.\nCuddles was the foundation's first guide horse in full service. She became 45-year-old Dan Shaw's helper. Shaw has an eye disease and his sight is very poor. One night, while filling out a form to get a guide dog, Shaw heard a news story on TV about people training horses to guide the blind. Shaw loves horses and wanted a guide animal that would live a long time. So he applied ,and a year later, Cuddles and Shaw began training as a team.\nOn a trip to New York, Cuddles helped Shaw safely visit many places of interest .They even traveled on a boat and on the subway system.\nShaw says that he is very lucky to have Cuddles. He believes that Cuddles has changed his life for the better by giving him the chance to do things himself and making him feel much more confident about himself.",
