  "article": "You can never be too sure these days in the United States of your neighbors or even your customers! Try to keep a low profile   in your neighborhood: Don't announce to everyone that you are running a home business with thousands of dollars worth of equipment. As much as possible, do not invite clients   or visitors to your home. In fact, I know of some homebased entrepreneurs   who would rather meet their clients in a neutral ground, e.g. the client's office or even Starbucks.\nThere are other ways to keep burglars away from your house.\n*Keep lights on around your house in the evenings. Light is a natural fright for burglars.\n*Invest in a security alarm, particularly if your house is located at a remote spot. Security systems can often bring down the cost of your homeowner's premium  .\n*Make sure that all windows and doors are locked and the security alarm turned on before you sleep at night or go out of the house. Avoid keeping house keys in obvious places, such as under the lamp or on top of the doorframe.\n*Adding an additional lock will provide extra security when you are home. The deadlock, sometimes called an \"exit only deadbolt\"is a deadbolt that does not have an external   key. It is clearly visible on the door from the outside, but cannot be broken into without destroying the door, frame or lock itself. While this security won't help directly when you aren't home, the visibility may discourage an _ from trying the door.\n*Your door itself should be made of strong materials, such as oneinch thick solid hardwood or heavy metal.",
