  "article": "Michelle Obama, Kate Moss and Samantha Cameron are three of the most stylish women on the planet but it seems they have their daughters rather than their style know how to thank for that. New research has shown that women with daughters tend to be more stylish than mothers of sons; a fact partly because of the style advice their daughters offer as they get older.\n78 percent of women over the age of 50 say they would be more than happy to let their daughters choose a complete outfit for them. However, just five percent of women say they would turn to their sons for style advice, while 28 percent believe that mothers of boys are less fashionable than women with girls.\n\"Women who don't have daughters become less interested in style as they grow older but having a daughter may keep alive her interest in looking great,\" comments psychologist Honey Langcaster - James. \"And, because of their close relationship, they also have a source of support and encouragement when it comes to their style decisions.\"\nMore than a quarter of women believe that Mums who have sons are less fashion - conscious than Mums with daughters. The most common reasons for this are that daughters are more critical  , offer good advice and inspiration, and add an element of competition to look the best while sons don't seem to care and aren't as strict as daughters.\nInterestingly, although mothers tend to rely on their daughters' style tips, their confidence isn't reciprocated, with 40 percent of women between the ages of 19 and 34 saying they wouldn't allow their mothers to shop for them as what their mothers would choose for them would not be as good as they expected.\nAnd although they might not appreciate the fashion advice, the research, which was conducted by online retailer Gray & Osbourn, showed that daughters do still need their mothers with 71 percent saying they chat to their female parent every day.\n\"Overall, the research shows just how important relationships are between mothers and daughters,\" added Langcaster - James, \"and just how much women appreciate an honest and trustworthy opinion.\"",
