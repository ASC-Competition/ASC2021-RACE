  "article": "The reason why women love to spend hours in shops while men prefer to be in and out of the high street in minutes can trace back  to their hunter-gathering past, find scientists.\nWhile women spent their days gathering food, often with children, men were hunters who made plans about how to catch and kill their prey  . These two ways of getting food in the past show how we shop in modern times, the study believes.\nWomen would spend hours trying to find the right things, because they had in the past spent ages trying to find the best quality and health-giving food. Men, on the other hand, decided in advance what animal they wanted to kill and then went looking for it. Once it was found and killed, they returned home.\nDaniel Kruger, professor of the University of Michigan, said the study could be the answer to why there are a lot of _ when couples go shopping together. He said it could also help couples to avoid fights in the shops if they understood the reasons why each sex had different ways of deciding on the perfect present.\n\"In modern times, women are much more likely than men to know when a specific type of item will go on sale. Women also spend much more time choosing the perfect color and texture.\"\nProfessor Kruger said his study was important because if men and women understood each other's shopping habits they could avoid arguments while shopping.",
