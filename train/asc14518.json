  "article": "The World's Largest Insect .This giant insect can be used as a toy.\nA child ties one end of a string to a stick and the other end around the \"neck\" of an insect. Holding the stick, the child lets the insect go. With a loud whirring sound, the insect takes off, pulling the string in a large curve over the child's head. The child laughs as the stick jumps around. The child is African, and the toy is the African Goliath beetle, the largest insect in the world.\nThe Goliath is a true insect because it has six legs and a body that is divided into three parts. Like all beetles, it has two pairs of wings. The front pair are thick and stiff and protect the back pair, which are soft. It is these soft back wings that make the beetle fly forward. They also cause the loud whirring sound the beetle makes when it flies. To steer, the beetle twists and turns its legs the same way you steer a bike by turning its front wheel.\nAfrican children often use the Goliath beetle as a toy. Although it is over 15 centimeters long, it is quite harmless.",
