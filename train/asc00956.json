  "article": "A thief entered the bedroom of the 30th President of the United States, who met him and helped him escape punishment.\nThe event happened in the early morning hours in one of the first days when Calvin Coolidge came into power, late in August, 1923.He and his family were living in the same third-floor suite   at the Willard Hotel in Washington that they had occupied several years before.The former President's wife was still living in the White House.\nCoolidge awoke to see a stranger go through his clothes, remove a wallet and a watch chain.\nCoolidge spoke, \"I wish you wouldn't take that.\"\nThe thief, gaining his voice,  said, \"Why?\"\n\"I don't mean the watch and chain, only the charm  .Take it near the window and read what is impressed on its back, \" the President said.\nThe thief read, \"Presented to Calvin Coolidge.\"\n\"Are you President Coolidge ? \" he asked.\nThe President answered, \"Yes, and the House of Representatives   gave me that watch charm.I'm fond of it.It would do you no good.You want money.Let's talk this over.\"\nHolding up the wallet, the young man said in a low voice, \"I'll take this and leave everything else.\"\nCoolidge, knowing there was $80 in it, persuaded the young man to sit down and talk.He told the President he and his college roommate had overspent during their holiday and did not have enough money to pay their hotel bill.\nCoolidge added up the roommate and two rail tickets back to the college.Then he counted out $32 said it was a loan  .\nHe then told the young man, \"There is a guard in the corridor.\" The young man nodded and left through the same window as he had entered.",
