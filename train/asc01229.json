  "article": "Goats are amazing animals. They can survive just about anywhere. Altogether there are nine species of goats in the world.\nGoats have more uses than you could ever imagine. Goat's meat can be eaten and goat's milk is becoming popular as a healthy choice to drink milk. Goat's milk is easier to take in than cow's milk and it is called universal milk as it can be used to bottle-feed most animals. In nutrition, it is also good. Goat's skins are still used today to make gloves and other items of clothing. The initial reasons for domesticating   goats were to get goat's hair, meat and milk. Goat's skins were used up until the Middle Ages for making bottles to hold water and wine for people who were traveling or camping.\nJust like sheep, goats are considered to be the first domesticated animal. The domestication process began over 10,000 years ago in a North Iranian town. A lot of people keep goats as pets nowadays.\nGoats are easily trained and you can teach them to pull carts and walk on ropes. Goats are also known for escaping their pens . If you have unsecured fencing, your goats will be interested in it and test it out and soon you will know where the openings are. Goats are also widely known for their ability to climb trees, although the tree generally has to be at a slight angle .\nIf goats are raised correctly and trained from an early age, they never develop any bad habits. Goats will attack each other. However, if they're corrected from an early age they never attack humans or other animals.",
