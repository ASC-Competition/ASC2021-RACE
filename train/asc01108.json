  "article": "Many scientists are now exploring the idea of going to live on Mars. Some other scientists from the MASA AMES Center  have already started the creation of a \"Mars town\" and many others are in fact already experimenting with it. Of course, these experiments are done on Earth itself but this \"Mars town\" has an environment practically like that of Mars.\nThe astronauts working in these towns wear their space suit and also do everything they would really have to carry out if they ever go to Mars in the future.\nBut Mars would be like Earth, a temporary  place for humans. When the Sun starts swallowing up  the planets, Mars will disappear only hours after Earth. So Mars only seems to be the ideal place to spread the human beings. It is also a good location to send humans if ever there is a disaster on Earth. By saying disaster, I mean asteroids  hitting and things like that.\nIf we humans do not want to disappear when Earth or Mars gets swallowed up, we will have to go and live beyond the solar system. But are there any planets outside our solar system prepared to support life? Astronomers' answer is:\n\"If Earth can support life, why can't other planets do the same too? Astronomers have already discovered a Jupiter - like planet _ a Sun-like star, so why not an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star?\nTo achieve this goal though, many other problems have to be taken into consideration. How do we transform  a dusty planet like Mars into one more or less like our Earth? How should we go on? There is still a long way to go.",
