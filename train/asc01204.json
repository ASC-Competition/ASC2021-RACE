  "article": "Shakespeare's life can be divided into three periods: the first 20 years in Stratford, which includes his schooling,early marriage, and fatherhood;the next 25 years as an actor and playwright   in London; and the last five in retirement back in Stratford where he enjoyed the wealth gained from his theatrical   successes. The years linking the first two periods are marked by a lack of information about Shakespeare, and are often referred to as the \"dark years\".\nShakespeare probably left school at 15, and took some sorts of jobs, especially since this was the period of his father's financial difficulty. A great number of references in his plays suggest that William may have in fact worked for his father, thus gaining specialized knowledge.\nAt some point during the \"dark years\", Shakespeare began his career with a London theatrical company -- perhaps in 1589 -- for he was already an actor and playwright in 1592. Shakespeare apparently wrote and acted for Pembroke's Men, as well as a lot of others, in particular Strange's Men, which later became the Chamberlain's Men.\nWhen, in 1592, the theaters were closed for about two years, due to a terrible disease. Shakespeare turned to writing book-length poetry. Most _ were Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, both of which have been translated into many languages and even been included in students' textbooks. During this same period, Shakespeare was writing his sonnets  , which are more likely signs of the time's fashion rather than actual love poems detailing any particular relationship. He returned to play writing when theater reopened in 1594, and published no more poetry. His sonnets were published without his permission in 1609, shortly before his retirement. His final play was Henry VIII, two years before his death in 1616.",
