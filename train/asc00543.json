  "article": "Grandpa Nybakken loved life -- especially when he could play a trick on somebody. At those times, his large Norwegian frame shook with laughter while he pretended innocent surprise, exclaiming, \"Oh, forevermore!\" But on a cold Saturday in downtown Chicago, Grandpa felt that God played a trick on him, and grandpa wasn't laughing.\nGrandpa worked as a carpenter. On this particular day, he was building some boxes for the clothes his church was sending to an orphanage abroad. On his way home, he reached into his shirt pocket to find his glasses, but they were gone. He remembered putting them there that morning, so he drove back to the church. His search proved fruitless.\nSuddenly, he realized what had happened. The glasses had slipped out of his pocket unnoticed and fallen into one of the boxes, which he had nailed shut. His brand new glasses were heading for China!\nThe Great Depression was at its height, and Grandpa had six children. He had spent twenty dollars for those glasses that very morning.\n\"It's not fair,\" he told God as he drove home in frustration. \"I've been very faithful in giving of my time and money to your work, and now this.\"\nSeveral months later, the director of the orphanage was on vacation in the United States.He wanted to visit all the churches that supported him, so he came to speak on Sunday night at my grandfather's small church in Chicago. Grandpa and his family sat in their usual seats among the small congregation  .\n\"But most of all,\" he said, \"I must thank you for the glasses you sent last year.\"\n\"Even if I had the money, there was simply no way of replacing those glasses.Along with not being able to see well, I experienced headaches every day, so my co-workers and I were much in prayer about this. Then your boxes arrived.When my staff removed the covers, they found a pair of glasses lying on the top.\" After a long pause, he continued, \"Folks, when I tried on the glasses, it was as though they had been custom-made just for me! I want to thank you for being a part of that!\"\nThe people listened, happy for the amazing glasses. But the director surely must have confused their church with another, they thought, there were no glasses on their list of items to be sent overseas.\nBut sitting quietly in the back, with tears streaming down his face, an ordinary carpenter realized _ had used him in an extraordinary way.",
