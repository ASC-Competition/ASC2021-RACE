  "article": "I'm Lisa from London,England,and I'm a vegetarian.That's someone who don't eat meat.Why am I a vegetarian? Well,I love animals,so I don't want to eat them.We can stay healthy if we eat onlv fruit and vegetables.\nA lot of  people are vegetarians in England.There are a few shops and restaurantints that sell food  Just for us.For example,there's a store near my house that makes lots of dishes with cheese and tofu. The tofu is great but I can't eat the cheese.It has too much fat.\nIt's easy to be a vegetarian when I'm at home.1 cook lots of interesting dishes from grains and vegetables.I can make many different kinds of food,and I often cook meals for myfamily  they aren't vegetarians,but they don't mind vegetarian food\nIn some restaurants it is difficult to get vegetarian food.Last Sunday, I went to Steve's Steakhouse with my friends.They all wanted to eat roast beef. I looked for vegetarian food,but\nevery dish had meat in it.I asked the waiter;\"Can you give me something with no meat?\"He asked,\"Would you like some fish?\"\"No,thanks,\"1 said.\"I only want vegetables--no meat,and no fish.\"\"But this is a steakhouse.\"said the waiter.\"People come here because they want to eat meat!\"\nSo we didn't eat in Steve's Steakhouse.We went to an Italian restaurant.My friends had meat pizzas(yuck!),and Ihad a big salad.",
