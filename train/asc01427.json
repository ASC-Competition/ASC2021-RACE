  "article": "People with bigger brains ftend to score higher on standardized tests of intelligence, according to new study findings.\nHowever, the study author Dr Michael A.McDaniel of the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond emphasized that these findings represent a general trend, and people with small heads should not automatically believe they are less intelligent. For instance, Albert Einstein's brain was \"not particularly large\", McDaniel noted. \"There's some relationship between brain size and intelligence on the average, but there's plenty of room for exceptions,\" he said.\nInterest in the relationship between brain size and intelligence grew in the1830s,  when German anatomist  Frederich Tiedmann wrote that he believed there was \"an unquestionable connection between the size of the brain and the mental energy displayed by the individual man\". Since that statement, scientists have conducted numerous studies to determine if Tiedmann's  assertion was, in fact, correct. Most studies have looked into the link between head size and intelligence. More recently, however, researchers have published additional studies on brain size and intelligence, measured using MRI scan .\nFor his study, McDaniel analyzed more than 20 studies that looked into the relationship between brain size and intelligence in a total of 1,530 people. The studies showed that on the average, people with larger brain volume tended to be more intelligent. The relationship between brain volume and intelligence was stronger in women than men, and in adults than in children. McDaniel notes in the journal Intelligence.\nMcDaniel is not sure why the relationship was stronger for adults and women. \"Other research has shown that women, on the average, tend to have smaller brains than men, but score just as well--if not higher--in tests of intelligence,\" he said.\nMcDaniel insisted that the relationship between brain size and intelligence is not a \"perfect\" one. \"One can certainly find lots of examples of smaller-sized people who are highly intelligent,\" he said, \"But, on the average, the relationship holds.\"",
