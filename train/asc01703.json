  "article": "Myth: If you cut your hair, it will grow long faster.\nTruth: That's not true. \"Your hair isn't like a lawn or a rosebush, where cutting can stimulate fresh growth,\" says Phillip Kingsley. The length of your hair is genetically determined. When it reaches a certain length, it stops growing. When you clear up the dead split ends, this make your hair look healthier, but not necessarily longer.\nMyth: If you skip meals, you lose weight fast.\nTruth: There's no truth in this advice. Not only will you lose weight by starving yourself, but according to Carol Ann Rinzler, this may actually cause you to gain weight. Rinzler reasons that missing a meal causes your metabolism  to slow down so that you burn food more slowly. This only makes you feel hungrier and by the time you finally do reach the table you will probably eat more food. Strange as it may seem, studies show that eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day is a more healthy way to lose pounds.\nMyth: If you swallow gum,it will stay inside your stomach for seven years.\nTruth: Actually, it takes just a few days for gum to make its exit---not seven years, says NeiIzenberg, M. D., editor of Kids Health Organization. But because gum is made of the same thing as rubber, it cannot be fully digested in your stomach--- so if you gum up the works on a regular basis, you might find yourself in a sticky situation.\nMyth: The best way to stop a nosebleed is to lift your head back.\nTruth: Now that's bad advice. Bloody noses are caused by broken blood vessels, so while lifting your head back might stop the fluid from rushing out of your nose, it won't stop the bleeding; you'll just end up swallowing lots of blood. Your best bet? \"Rest quietly. Don't poke or pick, and the blood will naturally clot   within a minute or two\". Suggests Dr. Izenberg.",
