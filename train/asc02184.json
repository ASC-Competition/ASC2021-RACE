  "article": "It is difficult for parents of nearly every family to teach their children to be responsible for housework, but with one of the following suggestions, you really can get your children to help at home.\nIf you give your children the impression that they can never do anything quite right, then they will regard themselves as unfit or unable persons. Unless children believe they can succeed, they will never become totally independent.\nMy daughter Carla's fifth - grade teacher made every child in her class feel special. When students received less than a prefect test score, she would point out what they had mastered and declared firmly they could learn what they had missed.\nYou can use the same technique when you evaluate  your child's work at home. Don't always scold and give lots of praise instead.  Talk about what he has done right, not about what he hasn't done. If your child completes a difficult task , promise him a Sunday trip or a ball game with Dad.\nLearning is a process of trying and failing and trying and succeeding. If you teach your children not to fear a mistake of failure, they will learn faster and achieve success at last.",
