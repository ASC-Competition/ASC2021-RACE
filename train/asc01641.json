  "article": "There are several ways to break the technology code that teenagers have written among themselves. The following are ideas to help parents understand the sometimes confusing world of the teens.\nSocialNetworking  Sites: Sites like MySpace and Facebook _ all generations and are a good way for a parent to understand what social standards your teen is living with. There are many ways to help you take part in your child's online activities. You also can be from an onlooker   who keeps a bird' s-eye view of his cyber world to an active member of his social group.\nMMORPG: Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game comes in the form of games. A child can easily become addicted to   them if no limits are set. To fully understand the attraction behind MMORPG, you can make your own account and character to explore the digital   world. Playing the online games may seem strange at first to your teen, but experience has led me to only positive feedback   from young people who can communicate with adults about their gaming experiences.\nText and Instant Messenger: The ways of teenage communication have produced a whole new language, such as \"LOLZ\" (laughing out loud) and \"PSOS\" (parent standing over shoulder). Learning the basic shorthand   of teens can open up a whole new world of communication, not only talking to your teens, but being able to listen on their terms as well. You may just find yourself texting faster and ending your correspondence   with TTYL (talk to you later). To teens, texting anyone looks cool, even Mom and Dad.\nEmail: Emailing your child is easy. This, of course, cannot take the place of face-to-face communication, but it provides another way for your child to reach you. Another benefit is that your child cannot act like he didn't hear you.",
