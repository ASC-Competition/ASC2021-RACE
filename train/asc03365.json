  "article": "Elephants might be the most well-known and well-loved animal in African wildlife. But conservation   of the African elephant faces special difficulties. While the elephant population is half of what it was 40 years ago, some areas of Africa have more elephants than populated areas can support. That's why AWF scientists are studying elephant behavior, protecting habitats and finding ways for humans to live peacefully with elephants in Africa.\nYears ago, over hunting and the ivory trade were the biggest threats to elephants survival. Luckily, ivory bans  , hunting rules and protected areas protect elephants from these dangers today.\nThe 21st century brings a different challenge to elephant conservation --land-use. Elephants walk across borders and outside parks and other protected areas. So they often destroy crops, causing conflicts   between local farmers and these big animals.\nSuccessful conservation strategies   must allow elephants to walk freely in their natural habitats while reducing conflicts between elephants and local people.\nAWF researchers are searching for a way to give both elephants and people the space they need. The AWF is collecting information on elephant habitats and behavior. The information they gather will help to develop the widest possible space for elephants.\nThe AWF is helping elephants by protecting their habitats. And they also work with local farmers to improve their life in order to encourage them to protect rather than destroy elephants.",
