  "article": "This is a talk by a London taxi driver.\n\"I've been a taxi driver for nearly ten years. Most London taxi drivers have their own taxis.\"\n\"It's a nice job most of time. You meet a lot of people. I always work at night, because there is too much traffic during the day. I live twenty miles outside London and I go to work at 5:30 in the afternoon.\"\n\"I usually go home between 2 and 3 in the morning.\"\n\"Some very strange things happened late at night .The other day I was taking a woman home from a party .She had her little dog with her. When we got to her house, she found that she had lost her key. So I waited in the car with the dog while she climbed in through the windows.\"\n\"I waited and waited. After half an hour of ringing the bell I decided to find out what was going on .I tied the dog to a tree and started to climb in through the window. The next thing I knew was that the police came. They thought I was a thief.\nLuckily the woman came downstairs.She must have gone to sleep and forgotten about me and the dog!\"",
