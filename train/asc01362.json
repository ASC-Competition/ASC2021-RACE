  "article": "For as long as they can remember Jynne Martin and April Surgent had both dreamed of going to Antarctica.This winter,they each made it to the icy continent as guests of the National Science Foundation(NSF).Bm they didn't go as scientists.Martin is a poet and Surgent is an artist.They went to Antarctica as participants.in the NSF's Artists and Writers program.The NSF is thegovernment agency that funds scientific research in Antarctica.But it also makes it possible for artists,including filmmakers and musicians,to experience Antarctica and contribute their own points of view to our understanding of the continent.\nThe mixing of science and art in Antarctica isn't new.Some of the earliest explorersbrought along painters and photographers.Edward Wilson was a British painter,doctor,and bird expert who journeyed with RobertFalcon Soott on two separate Antamtic expeditionsmore than 100 years ago.Herbert Ponting was a photographer who also accompanied Scott on one of those expeditions.In hundreds of photos,Pontingcaptured the beauty of the continentand recorded the daily lives and heroic struggles of the explorers.\nToday's scientists write articles forscientificjournals.Unlike theearly explorers'journals,scientific papers can now be very difficult for non-scientists to understand.Writers in Antarctica workto explain the research to the public.Peter Rejcek is editor,writer,and photographer for the Antarctic Sun,an onlinemagazine devoted to news about the U.S.Antarctic Program.Rejeck began his career in the Antarctic in 2003 by spending a year at the South Pole.He has returned everyyear since,interviewing,scientists about research at Palmer,McMurdo,and South Pole stations.\nThere are also scientists in Antarctica who work hardto explain their research to the public.Scientist Diane McKnight wrote The Lost Seal,a children's book that explains the research she and others are doing in an unusual ice-free area in Antarctica called the Dry Valleys.\nAntarctica is full of stories and wonders that are scientific,historic.and personal. People such as Martin,Surgent,Rejcek,and McKnight are devoted to bringing those storiesto asmany peopleare they can.\"Some people are going to be scientists,some people are goingto be journalists,some people are going to be artists,but we can all work together,'saysSurgent,\"tocelebrate,thisextraordinary place.\"",
