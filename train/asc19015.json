  "article": "Two students started quarreling at school. One student shouted dirty words at the other, and a fight began.\nWhat can be done to stop fights like this at school? In some schools, disputants  sit down with peer mediators  . Peer mediators are usually students with special training in this kind of problems.\nPeer mediators help disputants to talk in a friendly way. Here are some of the ways they use.\n1. Express what you think clearly but don't say anything to hurt the other. Begin with \"I feel\" instead of \"You always\".\n2. Listen carefully to what the other person is saying. Don't stop the other person's words.\n3. Keep looking at the other person's eyes when he or she speaks.\n4. Try to see the problems on the other person's side.\n5. Never _ . Saying things like \"You are foolish  \" makes the talk difficult.\n6. Try to find a result that makes both people happy.\nPeer mediators never decide on the winner. They don't decide who is right or who is wrong. Instead they help disputants to find their own \"win-win\" result. A \"win-win\" result can make everyone feel good.\nPeer mediators' work is often successful just because it gets disputants to talk to each other. And getting disputants to talk to each other is the first step in finding a \"win-win\" result.",
