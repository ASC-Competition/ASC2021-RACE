  "article": "\"Hey, Jenna, do you think we' ll still be friends when we're eighty-two?\" I asked my friend.\nLosing Jenna would be like losing a very close sister.\n\"Of course, we'll still be friends when we're eighty-two,\" Jenna announced loudly\nThe next year, in Grade Four, we met Jamie. The three of us soon became close friends. We played together almost every day. I thought even time couldn't pull us apart, but I was sadly mistaken.\nThe three of us started fighting a lot. Before Christmas, We had a really big fight, and Jamie and Jenna were against me, both saying I was bossy  . I felt helpless and lonely. I thought Christmas would be horrible!\n _ \n\"Wow,\" I said, breaking the silence as we stood on either side of my front door. \"Thanks.\"\n\"Okay...well... I have to go,\" she said softly.\n\"Okay. See you later then...\" and I closed the door.\n\"Who was that at the door?\" my mom asked.\n\"It was Jenna, my classmate.\" I said.\nThe card started off with \"Merry Christmas\", but then it said, \"I am so glad we're friends. I am sorry about what I said when we were fighting. A fight won't stop us from being friends. Besides, we said we were going to be friends even when we're eighty-two.\"\nI stopped reading and started laughing. I couldn't believe I had forgotten what she said that day in the backyard. I couldn't believe I had been so selfish in trying to make my friends feel sorry for me.",
