  "article": "One fine afternoon, I was walking along Fifth Street when I remembered that it was necessary to buy a pair of socks. Why I wished to buy only one pair was unimportant. I turned into the first sock shop that caught my eye. A boy clerk, who could not have been more than seventeen years old came forward. \"What can I do for you, sir?\" he said \"I wish to buy a pair of socks.\" I replied.\nHis eyes shone. There was a note of excitement in his voice. \"Did you know that you had come into the finest place in the world to buy socks?\" I had no idea of that, as my entrance had been accidental. \"Come with me,\" said the boy, eagerly. I followed him to the back of the shop, and he began to pull down box after box from the shelves, showing their contents  for my choice.\n\"Hold on, lad\" I said \"I am going to buy only one pair!\" \"I know that,\" said he, \"but I want you to see how beautiful these are. Aren't they wonderful!\" There was on his face an expression of seriousness and pride and delight as if he were showing me the secrets of his religion . I became far more interested in him than in the socks. I looked at him in surprise. \"My friend, \" said I, \"if you can keep this up, if this is not merely from having a new job, if you can keep up this high spirit and excitement day after day, in ten years you will own every sock in the United States.\"",
