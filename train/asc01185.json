  "article": "At the end of eight grade, our class went to Washington, D.C. For a group of 14-year-olds, this was a big deal!\nThe first day was so tiring; we could hardly remember where we were and what we were seeing. The next morning, we were off to seemonuments ,starting with Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson. We walked along the paths through trees. Then the Wall came into view--the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.\nAs I moved slowly closer to the Wall, I heard abagpipe in the distance, which seemed to show respect to the lives lost in the jungles of Vietnam .\nWe continued walking and felt surprised at the number of names carved in the black stone. I was determined to find a soldier with my last name, but my hunt was stopped when a man caught my eyes. He waskneeling  at the Wall, a single rose at his feet. His head was bowed and he was rubbing his fingers over one name. I thought how sad he was, and then moved on .\nAfter a few minutes I found one with my last name, but my eyes returned to the kneeling man. He was still rubbing his fingers over the same name. He never knew I was watching him, lost in deep sorrow. It was time for me to leave the kneeling man and the Wall. On the way home, I couldn't help thinking of the kneeling man and his sad face. I wasn't sure of the effects of war before, but at that moment I realized how much that man suffered from losing his loved one. Maybe he was the only one of so many families who experienced the same .\nI never knew the full effects of war until I saw that man. I only know about war from history classes. The kneeling man taught me more about war and the effects it has on people than any history book .",
