  "article": "B  It was a hot, humid day, and my brother Walt and I had decided that the only way to survive it would be to go swimming in a deep swimming hole across Mr.Blickez's pasture  and through some woods.\nThe only problem with our plan was that this pasture was guarded by a huge, mean Hereford bull.Mr.Blickez had told us that Elsie was the meanest bull in the township, maybe even the county, and we believed him.But the hotter it got, the more we thought there was something fishy about his claim.For one thing, we remembered Mr.Blickez liked telling tall tales; for another, Elsie seemed like an odd name for a bull.\nFinally, I talked Mom into asking permission for us to walk through the pasture, but then another problem surfaced.Mom said she would talk to Mr.Blickez if we would take our cousin Joanie along with us.Joanie was almost two years older than me and a head taller.If her teasing ever got around my grade school, it would be all over for me.In fact, I still had a headache from a quarrel with her that morning.\"I'm not going swimming with that dumb girl cousin.\" I told my mom.\n\"Either Joanie goes with, or you stay home alone,\" Mom said in her serious tone.I gave in and we set out.On our way across the pasture, Walt yelled suddenly.Elsie had approached him quietly and was licking  his back.Joanie and I dove under the wire fence, but while I was on the ground I looked up and saw that Elsie wasn't a big mean bull after all.She was going to keep licking my brother's back as long as he stood still.\nWe had many good days growing up and visiting our secret swimming hole guarded by the so-called \"big mean bull\".And as it turned out, for a girl cousin, Joanie hasn't been too bad.She's been one of my best friends over the years.",
