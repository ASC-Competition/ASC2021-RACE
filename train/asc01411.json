  "article": "Britons may like to complain a lot, but they rarely do so right now, explains BBC writer Ruth Margolis. They would rather grumble   afterward. This is because Britons hate to put someone out and cause any embarrassment. Margolis writes, \"For instance, I'm much more comfortable just leaving that piece of raw chicken on my plate instead of complaining to restaurant staff. But beware: if this kind of thing happens when you're dining with an American, they will most likely speak up on your behalf and not understand why you find this ashamed.\"\nIn a BBC blog post comparing cultural differences between the UK and the US, Margolis mentions a few other things that Americans like to do that are offensive to Britons.\n* Not making introductions\nMargolis says most Britons dislike this approach because \"talking to strangers without being introduced gives them a stomachache\". Americans rarely introduce a new friend to their friends at parties. Strangers are supposed to introduce themselves.\n* \"Quite\" good\nUsing \"quite\" to mean \"very\" happens a lot in the US. But if you are invited to a dinner party in Britain, don't describe the meal as \"quite good\" if you want to express high praise. To Britons' ears, \"quite\" _ the \"good\": the meal was OK but could have been better.\n* Money Talk\nAmericans can talk about money subjects for hours without feeling uncomfortable. For Britons, says Margolis, \"Talking about how much we make is unthinkable -- even 1ess so than discussing our feelings.\"\n* Over-politeness\n\"It's not that I want shop assistants to be actively rude. But neither do I want to expend energy responding to someone who's been paid to ask: 'How are you today?'\" says Margolis. In the US, it is not unusual to be greeted by a perfect stranger as \"honey\" or \"sweetie\". But Margolis says Britons find put-on friendliness, especially in stores, deeply irritating.",
