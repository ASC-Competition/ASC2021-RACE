  "article": "When traveling abroad, it is wise to carry your money in traveler's checks because checks are protected against loss or theft. If your checks are lost or stolen, the issuing authority will refund  your money.\nNot only are they safe, they are also convenient. They are available in different currencies and they can be cashed at most banks throughout the world. Most shops, hotels and restaurants also accept them.\nTraveler's checks are very easy to use. When you collect them, you sign each check once. The cashier enters the amount in your passport. When you cash, you sign each check again. The cashier will usually ask to see your passport again too.\nTo get traveler's checks you usually go to your bank. They can be paid in cash or in other ways. Large amounts, however, must be ordered in advance.\nFor the safety and convenience of traveler's checks, you are charged two commissions(,): an insurance commission when you buy them and an encashment commission when you cash them.\nIt is suitable to make a note of the serial numbers of your checks. Keep this separate from your traveler's checks.(191)",
