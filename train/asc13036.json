  "article": "Dana Cummings was in his thirties before he first went surfing. But, even more interesting is that Dana Cummings chose to learn the sport after losing a leg in a car accident. Now, nine years later, he helps other disabled   people learn how to ride the waves in AmpSurf.\nOn the coast of Maine, he is working with 27-year-old Matthew Fish, who is partly blind. Cummings takes hold of Fish and leads him into the ocean. The surfboard floats next to them. Fish lies on the surfboard. He tries to stand up on it. After a few attempts   he is up and riding all the way back to land. \"That was exciting,\" Fish says.\nA car accident in 2002 took Dana Cummings' leg. He says the crash changed him more than just physically. \"Losing my leg made me realize how precious   life is and get off the couch and start living. I do more things now than I ever did before. Next week I am going to compete in a contest in Hawaii,\" Dana says.\nOne year later Dana Cummings formed AmpSurf. AmpSurf is a group that volunteers to hold surfing classes and events for people with all kinds of disabilities.\nRecently, AmpSurf took its training programs to the East Coast. Eleven students attended the class in Maine. They came from all over the northeastern United States.\nDana Cummings thinks AmpSurf can change the way a disabled person thinks. \"Most people with disabilities consider himself or herself unlucky and useless, but we want them to see what they can do. Who cares you lose your leg or you are blind, whatever? Have fun. Just enjoy life. Take the most advantage of _ you can,\" Dana says.",
