  "article": "John is 6 years old. He can read and write very well, but he can't tell time. He doesn't say \"eight o'clock\", \"twelve o'clock\" or \"four o'clock in the afternoon\". He says \"breakfast time\", \"lunchtime\" or \"teatime\"\nHis aunt thinks she can teach him to read a clock.\n\"Can you count  , John?\"\n\"Yes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve...\"\n\"That's fine. Now, if I put the long hand of the clock on 'twelve' and the short one on 'one'-that is one o'clock. If I put the short hand on 'two', what's that?\"\n\"Two o'clock. \"\n\"Good. And on three?\"\n\"Three o'clock. \"\nIt is four o'clock in the afternoon, and John's aunt looks at him and asks: \"What time is it, now?\"\n\"Teatime, Aunt, and I'm hungry. \"",
