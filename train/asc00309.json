  "article": "Steve Flaig of Grand Rapids, Michigan, knew he'd been adopted as a baby, and when he turned 18, in 2003, he decided he'd try to track down his birth mother. The agency from which he'd been adopted gave him his mother's name: Christine Tallady. But online searches didn't turn up any results, and Flaig let it go.\nIn 2007, though, he searched for the name again online. This time, the search results included a home address near the Lowe's store where Flaig, then 22, worked as a deliveryman.When he mentioned the coincidence to his boss, his boss said, \" You mean Chris Tallady, who works here?\"\nFlaig and Tallady, 45, a cashier, had said hi to each other a few times at thestore, but they'd never really talked. He hadn't even known her name. Flaig thought, \" There's no possible way she's my mother.\"\nFor a few months, Flaig avoided Tallady. \" I wasn't sure how to approach her,\" he told a local reporter. Finally, an adoption agency employee volunteered to call Tallady for him.\nWhen Tallady realized that the nice guy she'd been waving at was her son, she _ . \" I wasn't ready to be a mother at that time.\" She'd given him up for adoption in 1985, when she was 23. However, she'd always hoped to meet her birth son one day. Later that day, mother and son talked for almost three hours at a nearbybar.\nMarried with two other children, Tallady said, \"I have a complete family now.\"",
