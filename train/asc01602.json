  "article": "On his bench in Madison Square Soapy moved uneasily, and he realized the fact that the time had come for him to provide against the coming winter.\nThe winter ambitions of Soapy were not of the highest. In them there were no dreams of Mediterranean voyages or blue Southern skies. Three months on the Island was what his soul desired. Three months of assured board and bed and good company, safe from north winds seemed to Soapy the most desirable thing.\nJust as the more fortunate New Yorkers had bought their tickets to Palm Beach each winter, Soapy had made his arrangements for his annual journey to the Island. And now the time had come.\nThere were many institutions of charity in New York where he might receive lodging and food, but to Soapy's proud spirit the gifts of charity were undesirable. You must pay in humiliation of spirit for everything received at the hands of mercy. So it was better to be a guest of the law.\nSoapy, having decided to go to the Island, at once set about accomplishing his desire. He left his bench and went up Broadway. He stopped at the door of a glittering cafe. He was shaven and his coat was decent. If he could reach a table in the restaurant, the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiter's mind. A roasted duck, with a bottle of wine, a cigar and a cup of coffee would be enough. Such a dinner would make him happy, for the journey to his winter refuge.\nBut as Soapy entered the restaurant door, the head waiter's eye fell upon his shabby trousers and old shoes. Strong hands pushed him in silence and haste out into the street.\nSome other way of entering the desirable refuge must be found.\nAt a corner of Sixth Avenue Soapy took a stone and sent it through the glass of a glittering shop window. People came running around the corner, a policeman at the head of them. Soapy stood still, with his hands in his pockets, and smiled at the sight of the policeman.\n\"Where is the man that has done that?\" asked the policeman.\n\"Don't you think that I have had something to do with it?\" said Soapy, friendly.\nThe policeman paid no attention to Soapy. Men who break windows don't remain to speak with policemen. They run away. He saw a man running and rushed after him, stick in hand. Soapy, disgusted, walked along, twice unsuccessful.\nOn the opposite side of the street was a restaurant for people with large appetites and modest purses. Soapy entered this place without difficulty. He sat at a table and ate beefsteak and pie. And then he told the waiter he had no money.\n\"Go and call a cop,\" said Soapy. \"And don't keep a gentleman waiting.\"\n\"No cop for you,\" said the waiter. \"Hey!\"\nThen Soapy found himself lying upon his left ear on the pavement. He arose with difficulty, and beat the dust from his clothes. Arrest seemed a rosy dream. The Island seemed far away.\nAfter another unsuccessful attempt to be arrested for harassing a young woman, Soapy went further toward the district of theatres.\nWhen he saw a policeman standing in front of a glittering theatre, he thought of \"disorderly conduct\". On the sidewalk Soapy began to sing drunken songs at the top of his voice. He danced, cried, and otherwise disturbed the peace.\nThe policeman turned his back to Soapy, and said to a citizen, \"It is one of the Yale boys celebrating their football victory. Noisy, but no harm.\"\nSadly, Soapy stopped his useless singing and dancing. The Island seemed unattainable. He buttoned his thin coat against the north wind.\nIn a cigar store he saw a well-dressed man who had set his silk umbrella by the door. Soapy entered the store, took the umbrella, and went out with it slowly. The man with the cigar followed hastily.\n\"My umbrella,\" he said.\n\"Oh, is it?\" said Soapy. \"Well, why don't you call a policeman? I took your umbrella! Why don't you call a cop? There stands one on the corner.\"\nThe umbrella owner slowed his steps. Soapy did likewise. The policeman looked at them curiously.\n\"Of course,\" said the umbrella man, \"well, you know how these mistakes occur...if it's your umbrella I hope you'll excuse me - I picked it up this morning in a restaurant - if it's yours, I hope you'll...\"\n\"Of course it's mine,\" said Soapy.\nThe ex-umbrella man retreated. The policeman hurried to help a well-dressed woman across the street.\nSoapy threw the umbrella angrily. He was angry with the men who wear helmets and carry clubs. They seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong.\nAt last Soapy stopped before an old church on a quiet corner. Through one window a soft light glowed, where, the organist played a Sunday anthem. For there came to Soapy's ears sweet music that caught and held him at the iron fence.\nThe moon was shining; cars and pedestrians were few; birds twittered sleepily under the roof. And the anthem that the organist played cemented Soapy to the iron fence, for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends.\nThe influence of the music and the old church produced a sudden and wonderful change in Soapy's soul. He thought of his degraded days, dead hopes and wrecked faculties.\nAnd also in a moment a strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate. He would pull himself out of this pit; he would make a man of himself again. Those sweet notes had set up a revolution in him. Tomorrow he would be somebody in the world. He would...\nSoapy felt a hand on his arm. He looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman.\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\"Nothing.\"\n\"Then come along,\" said the policeman.\n\"Three months on the Island,\" said the Judge the next morning.",
