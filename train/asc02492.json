  "article": "For a while, I wrote a \"Tuesday tip\" on my blog Lyonsdenmom.com. It was about easy week-night dinners, organizing parties or perhaps finding time out for friends.\nAbout a year ago, I ran out of tips.\nThe truth? As a busy working mom with five busy kids, I probably do have a few tips to share. But honestly, the bar is set pretty low---on a recent day when I was walking our dog, a stranger who knew I had five kids said, \"Wow! You have a dog, too?! And it even looks like you showered today!\" Yes, it's true, I shower. Not every day, but most days. See, I'm telling the truth. Honestly, in this cold winter, I'm probably taking a shower more to warm up than to clean up.\nOther funny truths? I'm tired. In fact, for the past year, I've been too tired to type up any update on our life here in Lyons Den. It's hard to arrange a career with all these kids. Although folks just believe that it must be so much easier now since all the kids are in school, I'm here to tell you, it's not. It's really not. When I get home from work, I'm often tearfully greeted by five kids and five homework folders filled with math facts, invitations, notices and artwork.\nAll those happy smiling faces I share on Facebook are real. We are a happy family---thank God for that! But we're not always smiling, and even in those rare best times when I can get all five kids looking at the camera, the odds would be that one of them isn't wearing underwear, one is pinching   someone behind the scenes and one is just perfectly pronouncing \"Damn!\" So, less perfectly-posed pictures, but more telling the truth. Even if only on Tuesday.",
