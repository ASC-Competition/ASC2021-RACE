  "article": "Bill, Frank, Dave and Tom were brothers. Every year they sent their mother expensive gifts on her birthday. They liked to show her how rich they were.\nThe eldest brother, Bill, had lots of money and wanted his mother to have the most expensive gift, but he didn't know what to buy. So he put an ad in the newspaper, \"Wanted--the greatest gift for my mother\".\nAbout a week before his mother's birthday, a man came to his office. He brought a big bird, this bird can speak foreign languages and sing pop songs. The man made the bird talk in French and tell a joke in Japanese. Then the bird sang a beautiful song. The next day, Bill sent the bird to  his mother with a birthday card.\nThe day after his mother's birthday, he called his mother, \"Well, mother,\" he asked, \"what do you think of the bird?\" \"Oh, it's very delicious, dear.\" said his mother.",
