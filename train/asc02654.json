  "article": "Today, paper-making is a big business. But it is still possible to make paper by hand, since the steps are the same as using big machines.\nYou should use paper with small amounts of printing. Old envelopes are good for this reason. Colored paper also can be used, as well as small amounts of newspaper. Small pieces of rags or cloth can be added. These should be cut into pieces about five centimeters by five centimeters.\nEverything is placed in a container, covered with water and brought to a boil. It is mixed for about two hours with some common chemicals and then allowed to cool. Then it is left until most of the water dries up. The substance left, called pulp , can be stored until you are ready to make paper.\nWhen you are ready, the pulp is mixed with water again. Then the pulp is poured into a mold. The mold is made of small squares of wire that hold the shape and thickness of the paper. To help dry the paper, the mold lets the water flow through the small wire squares.\nAfter several more drying steps, the paper is carefully lifted back from the mold. It is now strong enough to be touched.\nThe paper is smoothed and pressed to remove trapped air. You can use a common electric iron used for pressing clothes.",
