I don't know Japanese, and Yinzi doesn't know Chinese. We know some English. We are the same age. In the same class we have the same interests  . We like to sing Chinese, Japanese and English songs. I help her to ride a bike and fly a kite. She helps me to swim and jump. We like playing football, but we can't play in the school because the playground is small. Yinzi and the other girls in our class will go to the swimming pool on Monday, and I want to go with them.",
