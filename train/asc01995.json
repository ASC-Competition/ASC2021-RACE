  "article": "Edda, a Little Valkyrie's First Day of School\nWritten and illustrated  by Adam Auerbach.\n32 pp. Christy Ottaviano/Holt. $15.50.\nEdda's home is in Asgard, \"a land full of magic and adventure.\" But Edda, the littlest Valkyrie, doesn't have quite enough to do, until her father flies her \"all the way to Earth for the first day of school.\"\nThe contrast between home and school is hard to get used to (in one, she can ride reindeer; in the other she gazes guinea pig  through glass at the classroom). In his first picture book, Auerbach mixes the two worlds perfectly. Children are likely to appreciate the joke.\nPlanet Kindergarten\nBy Sue Ganz-Schmitt. Illustrated by Shane Prigmore.\n32 pp. Chronicle. $14.99.\nAfter careful preparations and a successful blastoff, a boy finds himself in a very unfamiliar environment. \"We're aliens from many galaxies  on Planet Kindergarten,\" he reflects as he sees his very varied classmates for the first time.\nPrigmore, who designs for the movie industry, uses black backgrounds and bright colors to give this space adventure visual excitement and humor.\nThe Smallest Girl in the Smallest Grade\nBy Justin Roberts. Illustrated by Christian Robinson.\n42 pp. Putnam. $18.99.\nIt makes sense that the author of the long, rhyming lines in \"The Smallest Girl in the Smallest Grade\" is a children's music performer. The story is about the power of one small person to fight prejudice.\nSally, whom no one ever seems to notice, is \"paying super extra special attention\" to the \"terrible stuff\" happening around her. When she decides to take action, she's not alone for long.\nAnd Two Boys Booed\nBy Judith Viorst.\n32 pp. Margaret Ferguson/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $16.59.\nEver felt quietly confident one minute, and a shaking mess the next? In Viorst's story about determination, a little boy wakes up thinking about singing his song in the class talent show.",
