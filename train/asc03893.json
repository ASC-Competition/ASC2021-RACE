  "article": "\"Just ate chicken feet for lunch. \" These were the words I wrote on my blog yesterday. By the next day there were hundreds of comments from my friends. They ranged from \"OH MY GOD! That is so disgusting! \" to \"What were they like?\" to \"Why can't you eat sandwiches like everyone else?\"\nTo Chinese people, chicken feet are a normal snack. To my friends in Britain, the thought of eating a chicken's foot is----well, weird  . As weird, in fact, as eating a bullfrog, scorpion , snake, or turtle.\nBut if there are two things I love more than anything else in life, they are: trying new things and food.\nI arrived in Beijing five months ago. Since then, I've searched for the \"weirdest\" foods so I can try them, then treat my friends to some \"virtual eating\" on my blog.\nOne weekend, I went to Wangfujing, Beijing's \"snack street\". The trip gave me tons of blog material.\n\"I chose a stick with three live, wriggling  scorpions on it,\" I wrote. \"And it was pretty good. The scorpion was warm and crispy. The legs did have a tendency to get stuck between one's teeth, however. What's more, I am sure scorpion number two stung me with its tail in revenge .\"\nNext came snake: \"A bit like a cross between fish and chicken, with a slightly rubbery texture and meaty taste.\"\nSome people were actually angry when I ate turtle soup----especially when I posted pictures showing the poor little guy's head staring sadly up at us from the bowl. \"I am never speaking to you again,\" wrote one (former) friend.\nStill, I will continue my culinary quest.\nNext on my list is starfish, though I feel I should have some vegetables too----algae, maybe.\nSo what am I eating, tonight, you may ask. Pizza. Well, a girl's gotta have a break sometimes.",
