  "article": "In a country that defines itself by ideals, not by shared blood, who should be allowed to come to work and live here? In the wake of the Sept.11 attacks these questions have never seemed more pressing.\nOn Dec.11, 2001, as part of the effort to increase homeland security, federal and local authorities in 14 states staged \"Operation Safe Travel\"---raids on airports to arrest employees with false identification.In Salt Lake City there were 69 arrests.But those captures were anything but terrorists, most of them illegal immigrants from Central or South America.Authorities said the undocumented workers' illegal status made them open to blackmail by terrorists.\nMany immigrants in Salt Lake City were angered by the arrests and said they felt as if they were being treated like disposable goods.Mayor Anderson said those feelings were justified to a certain extent.\"We're saying we want you to work in these places, we're going to look the other way in terms of what our laws are, and then when it's convenient for us, or when we can try to make a point in terms of national security, especially after Sept.11, then you're disposable.They are whole families being uprooted for all of the wrong reasons,\" Anderson said.\nIf Sept.11 had never happened, the airport workers would not have been arrested and could have gone on quietly living in America, probably indefinitely.Ana Castro, a manager at a Ben & Jerry's ice cream shop at the airport had been working 10 years with the same false Social Security card when she was arrested in the December airport raid.Now she and her family are living under the threat of deportation .Castro's case is currently waiting to be settled.While she awaits the outcome, the government has granted her permission to work here and she has returned to her job at Ben & Jerry's.",
