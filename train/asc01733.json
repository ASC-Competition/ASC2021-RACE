  "article": "Animals are natural resources that people have wasted all through our history.\nAnimals have been killed for their fur and feathers, for food, for sport, and simply because they were in the way. Thousands of kinds of animals have disappeared from the world forever. Hundreds more are on the danger list today. About 170 kinds in the United States alone are considered in danger.\nWhy should people care? Because we need animals. And because once they are gone, there will never be any more.\nAnimals are more than just beautiful and interesting. They are more than just a source of food. Every animal has its place in the balance of nature  . Destroying one kind of animal can create many problems.\nFor example, when farmers killed large numbers of hawks  , the farmers' stores of corn and grain were destroyed by rats and mice. Why? Because hawks eat rats and mice. With no hawks to keep down their numbers, the rats and mice multiplied quickly.\nLuckily, some people are working to help save the animals. Some groups raise money to let people know about the problem. And they try to get the governments to pass laws protecting animals in danger.\nQuite a few countries have passed laws. These laws forbid   the killing of any animals or plants on the danger list. Slowly, the number of some animals in danger is growing.",
