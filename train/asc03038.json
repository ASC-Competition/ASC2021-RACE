  "article": "In a time when a dangerous number of people are overweight, many people seem to have forgotten the most important way to keep healthy and slim---exercise. And as a new study carried out on mice in the lab has shown, exercise done early in life can reward you in your adult years.\nA team of researchers at the University of California studied the effects of early exercise on adult physical activity, body mass and eating. They found that early-age exercise in mice has positive effects on adult levels of voluntary exercise in addition to reducing body mass.\n\"These results may have an effect on the importance of regular physical education in elementary and middle schools,\" said Theodore Garland, a professor of biology, who led the research project. \"If kids exercise regularly through their school years, then they may be more likely to exercise as adults, which could have far-reaching positive effects on human health and well-being.\"\nAlthough the positive effects of early-life exercise lasted for only one week, it is important to note that one week in the life of a mouse is the same as about nine months for humans. \"Our results suggest that any positive effects of early-life exercise on adult exercise will need to be kept up if they are to be long-lasting.\"\nHis team of researchers found, too, that all mice that had access to early exercise were lighter in weight than non-exercised mice.\nGarland explained that, in general, exercise will stimulate appetite sooner or later. However, it is possible that certain types of exercise, done for certain periods of time or at certain light levels, might not _ appetite much, if at all, at least in some individuals.\n\"If we could understand what sorts of exercise these might be, then we might be able to tailor exercise recommendations in a way that would bring the benefits of exercise without increase in appetite, leading to a better chance of weight loss,\" he said.",
