  "article": "A new study says electronic toys are not helping babies learn.\n\"Even if companies are marketing them as educational, they're not teaching the babies anything at this time,\" said Anna Sosa the study's author.\nResearchers listened to audio recordings of parents playing with their babies aged 10 months to 16 months. The researchers compared the experiences when the children played with electronic toys, traditional toys such as blocks, or when the children looked at books. What they found is that parents talked less with their babies when the babies played with electronic toys.\nWhy is this important? Research shows that how quickly children develop language is often based on what they hear from parents. When the infants played with electronic toys, parents said little to their children. But with traditional toys, such as blocks, parents shared the names and descriptions of the animals, colors and shapes as their children played. There was even more information given by parents as their babies looked at the pictures in books.\nOf course, there is no need for parents to throw out electronic toys, but they should look at their infants' play with such toys as entertainment, not a learning experience.\nToy Industry Association spokeswoman Adrienne Appell responded to the study. She said it is important that parents make time to play with their children. \"Playing is a way that kids can learn so much, not only cognitive  skills, but social and developmental skills,\" she said. She added that play should be balanced, including time for just \"make believe\" activities, as well as traditional and electronic toys.",
