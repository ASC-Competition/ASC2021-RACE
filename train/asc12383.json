  "article": "Steven Jobs, the designer of Apple Computer, was not clever when he was in school. At that time, he was not a good student and he always made troubles with his schoolmates. When he went into college, he didn't change a lot. Then he dropped out . But he was full of new ideas.\nAfter he left college, Steven Jobs worked as a video game designer. He worked there for only several months and then he went to India. He hoped that the trip would give him some new ideas and give him a change in his life.\nSteven Jobs lived on a farm in California for a year after he returned from India.\nIn 1975, he began to make a new type of computer. He designed the Apple Computer with his friend in his garage. He chose the name \"Apple\" just because it could help him to remember a happy summer he once spent in an apple tree garden.\nHis Apple Computer was so successful that Steven Jobs soon became famous all over the world.\nHe often said, \"I live in order to change the world, there aren't any other reasons. The only way to have a great achievement is to love your own career. If you can't find your favorite career, go on looking for it and never give up.\"\nThis is Steven Jobs, though he is dead, his spirit and achievements still influence our lives.",
