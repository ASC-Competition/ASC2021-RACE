  "article": "When talking about humor, people often refer to famous humorists such as Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by the pen-name Mark Twain.\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens, America's famous writer, journalist and humorist, was born in Florida on November 30, 1835.He was the sixth of the seven children in the family.As a child, Samuel was often kept indoors because of his poor health.\nWhen Samuel was 12, his father died of a deadly disease and at the age of 13, Samuel had to leave school to make a living.He became a printer's apprentice .A year later, he became skilled at printing by working and studying hard.Samuel was then employed as a printer with pay.After two years, he became an editorial assistant.It was then that young Samuel became aware of his fondness for writing.\nWhen he was 17 years old, Samuel left Hannibal for a printer's job in St.Louis.While staying in St.Louis, Samuel became a river pilot in 1858.His pen-name, Mark Twain, came from his days as a river pilot.It is a river term meaning \"safe to sail\".\nBecause the river trade was brought to a stop by the Civil War in 1861, Samuel began working as a newspaper reporter for several newspapers all over the United States.Samuel's career took off and he became famous when his story The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras Country appeared in the New York Saturday Press on November 18, 1865.Samuel's first book, The Innocents Abroad was published in 1896.The two novels The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (in 1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (in 1885) brought him worldwide popularity.He wrote 28 books and numerous humor stories, letters and plays.\nMark Twain passed away on April 21, 1910.To remember him, his childhood home was open to the public as a museum in Hannibal.",
