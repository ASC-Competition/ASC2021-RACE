  "article": "Laura Brent is a manager in an important company. She has three children--the eldest is 10, and youngest is three. \"My job was only possible because my husband David was prepared to take my place and become a house husband,\" she says.\nMore and more couples are finding this arrangement suits them better in today's world, where women are rising to the top of their careers faster and more easily than they did in the past. Many men, on the other hand, like the idea of staying at home and looking after the children. \"My children see a lot more of me than I saw of my father when I was young, and I think it's better for them, especially for the boys,\" says David. \"It works just as well for Laura.\"\n\"Now I can come home from a hard day at work, and immediately relax with the children, instead of having to do the housework and the cooking,\" she says.\nIs there anything David misses about going out to work?\n\"Not really. I suppose the worst thing about looking after children and doing the housework is not having a lunch break! It's a lot harder than most men think.\"",
