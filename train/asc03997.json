  "article": "As a little child,1 was always plump .In college I started blowing up. It got out of control\nwhen l went to law school.\nI'd made a decision a thousand times: I'm going to lose weight now. But what motivated \nme to get serious about it was turning 30.1 weighed 414 pounds.1 was always tired. Some of my\nfamily members have suffered from heart disease, and l was frightened. I also wanted to look better.\nSo after my birthday,1 walked into the office of a weight loss doctor.\nShe was very understanding. Her focus was on balanced meals and she wanted me to exercise.\nWalking was all I could do at first. I started by walking a few blocks and gradually increased the\ndistance, until one weekend, I heard myself saying, \"Wow, this seems pretty easy.\" So I started to run.\n1 was losing nine or ten pounds a month, and I had more energy. I started to think about the New\nYork City Marathon. For years,1 watched the runners and thought, \"This looks like fun, but I could\nnever do that.\" But now I realized that maybe I could.I joined the New York Road Runners.I ran a\nl0km, then a half marathon.I still wasn't confident I could run a full 26 miles. But I told myself I was\ngoing to do it, no matter what.\nBy my 33rd birthday,1 was down to 180 pounds. I started formally training for the marathon.\nAnd on the morning of November l, I stood on the Verrazano Bridge in Staten Island with more than\n40,000 0ther runners, waiting for the event to start.\nIt was unbelievable to have the audience cheering me on, handing me cups of water. And I\ncrossed the finish line. My friends sprayed(......)me with beer, as if I'd won the Super Bowl.\nAnd at that moment,I knew: If I set my mind to something, nothing is impossible.",
