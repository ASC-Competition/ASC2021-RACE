  "article": "Have you ever hoped a toy balloon? They are very light. But there are much bigger balloons can fly very high up in the sky. They are big enough to carry people. They are called hot-air balloons.\nTo make a hot-air balloon go up, turn on the burner . That will make the air inside the balloon hotter. Then the balloon will go up.\nTo make the balloon go down, turn off the burner. The air inside the balloon will get cooler. Then the balloon will go down. Underneath(....) the balloon there is a large basket. That is where the pilot and the passengers go.\nThe burner is just above the basket. You can stand in the basket and turn the burner on and off. The balloon will go where the wind is blowing the right way! Do you want the balloon to go somewhere special? First make sure the wind is blowing the right way!\nPeople have been flying in hot-air balloons for over two hundred years. Before planes it was the only way of flying. Today people fly in hot-air balloon for fun. Some people like to race hot-air balloons.",
