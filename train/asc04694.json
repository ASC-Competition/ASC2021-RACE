  "article": "The British people are among the world's greatest readers of newspapers.It's been the custom ever since most people could read.\nBut why do people want to do nothing but read while traveling to work in a train? Perhaps they are tired, or else they sit behind a newspaper to shut themselves off from the world.All the same, most men would notice a woman struggling with a heavy case and jump up to help her and a pretty girl sitting opposite wouldn't escape their attention either.In this case a paper is useful because they can have a good look at her from behind it without her knowing.Perhaps they do nothing but read.There are stories of girls and young men who met in the rush hours, got married, and went on traveling in the same train hand in hand.",
