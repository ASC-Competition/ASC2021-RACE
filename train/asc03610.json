  "article": "\"Mommy! Call I go and play outside with Danny? Please? I promise l will only play in the shade!\" Kelly said.\nWhat hurt her mother was only being able to stand aside when her daughter needed her most.\"Kelly...I'm really sorry.You can't go.I'm too concerned about you. You might accidentally go in the sun,which means we have to get you to hospital again.\"Kelly was allergic to the sun.The doctor said it was incurable.\nKelly looked outside where her brother Danny was playing.Why did she have to be allergic to the sun? Why?\nKelly's mother closed her eyes and she pointed upstairs where Kelly's bed was.\"Go to bed.\"she said.Kelly had tears in her eyes.She forced her legs up the stairs and buried her face in her pillow.She wanted Danny to come back , for he could tell her stories about birds and squirrels.She waited,and soon he did come and told her about a blue bird he had seen.Kelly often wondered what a bird looked like.She was really curious about the birds in the yard.Maybe she could find out herself someday.\nThe next day, Danny entered Kelly's room again to tell her what he had seen.She wasn't there.He called again and again but no one replied.He searched anxiously around and saw a body.His eyes widened.It couldn't be.Was it what he thought it was? Was it...Kelly? With shaking hands,Danny turned over the body.He screamed.It was Kelly.Her skin was swollen and had ugly rashes all over.She was holding a pencil in her right hand.And in her left hand was an almost finished picture of a bird , below which he found some words which read:\"I finally get to see you.I will always remember you and love your nature no matter what.\"",
