  "article": "In America, each of the states likes to promote itself with a slogan .I currently live in Utah, where the slogan is \"Life Elevated\". It's a nod to outdoor entertainment in the high country,including  the ski industry. I previously lived in Colorado, a land with red dirt,\ngreat mountains and golden plains. T he slogan there is \"Colorful  Colorado\". Years ago I lived in the \"Peach State\" of Georgia, and I grew up in New Mexico as a little boy, whose slogan is \"Land of  Enchantment \".\nWe never seemed to get away from dust in New Mexico, so I  appreciate the story of a   newcomer to the Land of Enchantment who learned about dusty breezes. She was visiting an antique shop and the owner wiped down every item before showing it. The newcomer said,\"\nEverything gets dusty here pretty quickly, doesn't it?\"\"That's not dust, honey,\" the shop owner replied, \"That's ENCHANTMENT.\".\nThat made the problem more acceptable. That an escalator broke. He posted a sign to warn customers. He chose not to use the traditional \"Out  of Order\" or \"Do Not Use\" warnings. Instead, his sign read,\"This Escalator Is Temporarily a Stairway.\"He turned a minus into humor and made it a plus.\nAnd in fact there are some things, like the weather, we can't change. All we can change is our ways that we think and feel about them. I believe one of the best techniques to do this is to find some humor in the situation. Finding something amusing or enjoyable of  difficulty,  an irritation or a troublesome problem can be one of the most creative and effective things we can do. Sometimes the only sense you can make of a situation is a sense of humor.",
