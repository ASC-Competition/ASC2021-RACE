  "article": "Teenagers who turn off the TV and sit down to family meals are less likely to suffer eating disorders .\nA study has connected eating together with lower rates of bulimia  and anorexia . Teens used to eating around the table are less likely to take up smoking to lose weight.\nResearcher Barbara said, \"The common belief is that teens don't want to be around their parents very much, and that teens are just too busy to have regular meals with the family.\"\nThe study shows happy families have teenagers who eat with their parents often. These teens have less bad diet or dangerous eating habits.\n\"Parents may not be able to get their family together around the table seven days a week, but if they can prepare three family meals a week, this will have a big impact on the health of teens,\" Professor Fiese spoke out after reviewing 17 studies on eating ways and nutrition  of almost 200,000 children and teenagers.\nShe found that teens who eat at least five meals a week with their families are 35% less likely to be \"disordered eaters\".\nThe definition  of disordered eating is eating too much, or eating at wrong times too often or eating very little and smoking to lose weight.\nEven three family meals a week helped, with youngsters 12% less likely to be overweight than those who ate with their family less often.\nTeens can also use family meals as a time to _ . They were also 24% more likely to eat healthy foods and have healthy eating habits than those who didn't share three meals with their family.\nProfessor Fiese said, \"Family meals give them a place where they can go regularly to check in with their parents and express themselves freely.\"\nIn the past American research found children who miss out on family meals are much more likely to fight at school, drink and take drugs .\n,.",
