  "article": "I am a person who does not like to wait.I don' t like lines, being put on hold when making a phone call, arriving at an appointment to find that my companion will be delayed and of course, I don * t like waiting rooms.\nHowever, I realize that my agony  will not be good for me, as an increasingly, crowded world can only mean one thing--more waiting.\nOwing to this, I have taken a measure and decided to turn my disappointment to productive ends.In short, I am looking for what I call \"waiting in line books\".\nThese are books that contain material designed for being read in shortened words, so there is no extended story line to lose track of.Another requirement is that they be small enough to slip neatly into my back pocket.\nThe other day I went to the supermarket.Convinced that the rain would keep most people away, I was surprised to see that the place was crowded with shoppers.Every checkout was open--and jammed! But I could take out my pocket book and go to work.\nThe more the world demands that I wait, the more I learn from my waiting library.Look at these titles: One Hundred Things Every American Should Know; The Poetry of Robert Frost; Living Thoughts of Leading Thinkers; Still More Toasts.I have learned interesting and enriching things and much knowledge from these books.\nOn a recent visit to the general store, I placed my order at the counter along with six or seven other people.The one female employee seemed to have her hands full as she rushed about.\"Just be patient,\" she said to me.\nNo problem.I quietly opened my dictionary of prose   and poetical quotations. Perhaps the other customers regarded me as a bookish, lonely soul.But little did they realize that I was enjoying the company of Shakespeare, Thoreau, Homer and Ben Johnson.",
