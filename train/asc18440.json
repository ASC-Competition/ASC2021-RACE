  "article": "I stood up to speak and my mind went blank .Has this ever happened to you? You may be nervous in front of an audience .You may be worried that you didn't prepare enough, You may have forgotten some of your facts. What can you do? Sometimes people prepare too much and become terrified if they can't remember the words they have practised.
