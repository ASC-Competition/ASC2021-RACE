  "article": "Moving to a new neighborhood,town,state,or even country can be a pretty scary experience. All you know is that things will be different and chances are you won't know the kids at your new school.\nThe experiences that go with moving make many kids feel nervous and worried. This is perfectly normal but don't let these emotions overrun your thoughts! You will soon get used to your surroundings and find new friends at your new school.\nLeaving old friends and familiar places behind can be difficult. However,as you begin the moving process,keep in mind that saying goodbye to your old house,school,and friends does not mean that you have to forget them or that your farewell is permanent!If you're moving to a new state or even a different country and won't see your friends for a long time,don't despair.\nMake sure to ask everyone for their address so you can write them letters. Also,thanks to the Internet,it is very easy to stay in touch through email or instant messaging technologies. With your parent's permission,you can even create a blog or web page to chronicle  all of your new experiences. Include your thoughts,tales of your new adventures,even pictures of new friends,your new house,and new town. Your old friends will love seeing what you are busy with.\nMany schools have an orientation  program where a student already established at the school shows a new student around for their first week. This can help you to find your way around the school and to make new friends faster.\nWhile moving is tough on kids of any age,high school counselor Karen Turner says moves can be particularly difficult for teens .\"I think moving during adolescents is an extremely stressful experience,especially if you are into your junior high or senior year. Students tend to have established a very strong peer network during that period in their lives. Often this has more influence on them even than their families in some cases,and when they are torn from that there's often resentment .\"However,Turner adds that while moving isn't easy,there are things that your parents and the school can do to help you deal with the change.",
