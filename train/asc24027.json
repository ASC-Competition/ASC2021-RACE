  "article": "Two-year-old hero Ye Chengfeng saved most of his family from a deadly gas leak . As his grandfather lay dead, the child woke up his grandmother and saved five other family members from deaths.\nMore and more British school kids use their mobile phones to cheat  in exams. They use them to send messages to get the answers. So far this year, 1,013 students were caught cheating with mobile phones. Teachers are now teaching themselves so they can find the cheats. They also ask the students to hand the phones in before exams.\nA new study shows that girl chimps  are faster to use tools than boys! Experts found that girl chimps in East Africa use sticks to dig in the soil two years earlier than boys do. But they don't know why. Girls watched their moms work, but boys climbed trees. Yes, human girls always learn to write and draw first, but boys often run and play balls earlier than girls.\nIn Germany, doctors have three ways to help kids who are addicted  to the Internet. First, learning art -- Kids learn painting or singing; second, doing sports -- Kids do swimming or horse riding. The last one is to go into nature -- Kids plant flowers and grow vegetables. Doctors want kids to find other ways to have fun rather than surf the Internet.",
