Suddenly he remembered that he had left something in his room.\n\"Look here, boy,\" he said to the bellboy, \"run up to my room and see if I have left a parcel on the table there. Be quick about it.\"\nThe boy ran upstairs. Five minutes passed. The traveler was walking up and down the hall, looking very angry. At last the boy appeared.\n\"Yes, sir,\" he reported to the traveler,\" you have left the parcel there, it's right on the table in your room.\"",
