  "article": "Editor: Today our topic is part-time job. Are they good for school children or not?\nHeadmaster: Certainly not. Children have got two full-time jobs already: growing up and going to school. Part-time jobs make them so tired that they fall asleep in class.\nMrs. White: I agree. I know school hours are short, but there's homework as well, and children need a lot of sleep.\nMr. White: Young children, perhaps some boys, stay at school until they're eighteen or nineteen. A part-time job can't harm them. In fact, it's good for them. They earn their pocket money instead of asking their parents for it. And they see something of the world outside school.\nBusinessman: You're quite right. Boys learn a lot from a part-time job. And we mustn't forget that some families need the extra money. If the pupils didn't take part-time jobs, they couldn't stay at school.\nEditor: Well, we have got two for, and two against. What do our readers think?",
