  "article": "We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer. We usually go to the Lake Arrowhead for a few weeks, but we'd like to go somewhere else this year. We're tired of doing the same thing summer after summer. Some friends of ours suggested that we go to Hawaii. That would be wonderful! I'm sure we'd enjoy a trip like that, but of course _ . In the first place, it would be rather expensive, and in the second place, there wouldn't be enough time. If we're lucky enough to save some money between now and next summer, and if I'm lucky enough to get four weeks of vacation instead of two weeks, maybe we can go to Hawaii next year. As a matter of fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it might be advisable to stay home this summer and not go any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I could offer to work instead of taking two weeks off; then maybe my boss would suggest that I be given four weeks' vacation next summer instead of two weeks.",
