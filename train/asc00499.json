  "article": "Sir Emest Shackleton was not only a great explorer, but also an intelligent man. He once found himself and two of his men at the top of an icy mountain ridge   . They had no way to get down to its side. Their destination had been the tiny Whaling Station of strummers, near the South Pole. Shackleton knew if they didn't get down from the ridge, no one would ever hear from them again.\nShackleton knew there was only one thing to do. He explained that they would all have to slide down. He instructed the two men to wind  their ropes into a coil  .Then each of the men sat down on a coiled and slid down the icy slope into the darkness. When they found themselves at the bottom, unhurt, Shackleton said, \"You know, we shouldn't do that kind of thing too often.\" The laughter broke the tension all the men were feeling. They arrived later than expected, but safely at the Whaling Station.",
