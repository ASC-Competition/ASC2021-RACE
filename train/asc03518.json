  "article": "The traditional holiday is the most important to Chinese both home and abroad.\nUnited Kingdom\nCelebrations for Spring Festival in the UK started in 1980, with the first evening party held in 2002. Every new year, people get together and have a lot of activities. They sing songs, dance to music, share photos with friends or enjoy films in a cinema.\nUnited States\nSpring Festival has become a key time for Chinese living or working in the US. They join in a large evening party to welcome the traditional new year. It is a good chance for people to build a circle of friends and feel that they are not alone because they share the same culture and values.\nAustralia\nThe Chinese new year will be welcomed with three weeks of celebrations across Australia. Many people come to Sydney's Chinatown or Little Bourke in Melbourne. They enjoy fireworks,  lion dances,  dragon boat races and many other traditional activities.  The celebrations are also a bridge towards better understanding between Chinese and non-Chinese.\nSingapore\nThe family dinner on new year's eve is an important tradition for Chinese whether they were born in Singapore or moved there from China. They place traditional food on a table as an act of remembering their past. Then the whole family enjoy their dinner together. They usually hold it at home because having it in a restaurant takes away the meaning of the tradition.",
