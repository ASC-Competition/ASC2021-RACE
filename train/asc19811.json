  "article": "Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\nThis is an old English saying. Do you know it before? It says that we must go to bed early and get up early in the morning. Then we should be healthy. We should also be rich (wealthy) and clever (wise).\nThis is true. The body must have enough sleep to be healthy. Children of a young age should have ten hours' sleep every night. Children who don't have enough sleep can't do their work very well. They will not be wise and they may not become wealthy!\nThe body also needs exercise. Walking, running, jumping, swimming and playing games are all exercise. Exercise keeps the body strong.\nExercise also keeps the blood moving around inside the body. This is very important. Our blood takes food to all parts of our body. The head also needs blood. Exercise helps us to think better!",
