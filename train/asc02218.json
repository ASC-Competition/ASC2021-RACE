  "article": "There was a little boy visiting his grandparents on their farm. He was given a  slingshot to play with out in the woods. He practiced in the woods, but he could  never hit the target. Getting a little discouraged, he headed back for dinner. As he was  walking back he saw Grandma's pet duck.\nJust out of impulse ,he let the slingshot fly, hit the duck in the head and killed it. He was shocked! In a panic, he hid the dead duck in the wood, only to see his sister  watching! Sally had seen it all, but she said nothing.\nAfter lunch the next day Grandma said, \"Sally, let's wash the dishes\".  But Sally  said, \"Grandma, Johnny told me he wanted to help in the kitchen. \"Then she whispered to him, \"Remember the duck?\" So Johnny did the dishes.  Every time Grandma asked Sally to do some housework, she will repeat the same story.  After several days of Johnny doing both his work and Sally's, he finally couldn't stand it any longer. He came to Grandma and confessed that he had killed the duck.\nGrandma gave him a hug and said, \"Sweetheart, I know. You see, I was standing at the window and I saw the whole thing, but because I love you, I forgave you. I was just  wondering how long you would let Sally make a slave of you. \"\nIn our daily life, whatever we do, God is always standing at the window and he sees the whole thing. He's just wondering how long you will let the devil make a slave of you. The great thing about God is that when you ask for forgiveness, he not only forgives you, but also he forgets.",
