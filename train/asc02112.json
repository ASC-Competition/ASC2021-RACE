  "article": "Kenya wants to organize a major international conference to discuss how to fight piracy  off the coast of Somalia. The conference may also deal with ways to rescue Somalia from seventeen years of civil war. More than forty percent of its people depend on food aid.\nKenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula says the world cannot end piracy and civil war without dealing with Somalia's political problems.\nSomali pirates operate in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. The Gulf of Aden connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean by way of the Suez Canal. The pirates have fast boats, modern weapons and equipment like satellite phones and global positioning systems.\nPirates hijacked the Sirius Star off the coast of Kenya and moved it to waters off Somalia.\nThe tanker Sirius Star, at three hundred thirty meters long, is the biggest ship ever known to have been captured by pirates. It also happened farther south than most attacks, and farther out at sea ---- more than eight hundred kilometers from land.\nThe ship was headed for the United States with two million karrels of oil, worth an estimated one hundred million dollars. A Saudi Arabian company owns the tanker. The pirates have  reportedly demanded twenty-five million dollars in negotiations to release the ship and its crew of twenty-five.\nSomali pirates generally do not steal goods or kill hostages. They are believed to be holding seventeen ships with about three hundred crew members. Among the ships is a Ukrainian vessel hijacked  in September with a load of military weapons including tanks.\nThe increase in piracy is raising the cost of insuring ships. Also, oil from the Middle East and exports from East Asia could take longer to arrive.\nSome of the world's heaviest shipping traffic passes the Somali coast. But major shipping companies have begun to consider new routes. One of the world's biggest shippers, A.P, Moeller Maersk, says it will avoid the Gulf of Aden. A move away from the Suez Canal could hurt Egypt's economy.\nAmerican and other foreign navy ships are now watching for pirates. This week the Indian Navy destroyed a heavily armed \"mother ship\" in the Gulf of Aden. But the area to protect covers more than one hundred sixty million square kilometers.",
