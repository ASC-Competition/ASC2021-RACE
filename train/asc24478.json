  "article": "Seven years ago, a small town in Changhua started to grow healthy rice. What surprised us was that the \"farmers\" were not really farmers. They were students from a small middle school. Now everything on the farm goes well. And there are stories behind rice, too.\nThe idea of growing rice came from the school teachers decided to teach students how to grow healthy rice on the school land . They wanted the students to be close to(......) the land and learn to help each other outside the classroom.\nThe students and the teachers ate the rice. The school made money by selling  the rice and giving farming  classes to the community. With the money, the school could help some students go to foreign  countries some day.\nToday _ comes true--the students are flying to Japan to share their special farming stories, and have fun over there, of course! \"We all feel very happy that even students from a small town can make themselves stars,\" said one of the teachers.",
