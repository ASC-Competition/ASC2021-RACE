  "article": "Teenagers at one German school are learning how to achieve happiness alongside other traditional subjects such as math and languages. The class sit in a circle with their eyes shut and they count from one to ten: someone starts, the next voice comes from the far right, a third from the other side.\nThe aim of the game is to listen for an opportunity to shout out the number without clashing   with another voice or leaving a pause. On the first try, most of the young Germans try to be first, while a few are too shy to join in, but by the fifth time round, they develop a rhythm  .The message: give other people space but also confidently claim your own. This is a requirement for social well-being.\nThe Willy Hellpach School in Heidelberg is the first in the nation to develop a happiness course.\nIt is intended for students preparing for university entrance exams.\n\"The course isn't there to make you happy,\" Ernst Fritz-Schubert, the school principal, warned pupils, \"but rather to help you discover the ways to become happy.\"\nCooking a meal together is one of the class exercises. Improving body language under the guidance of two professional actresses is another.\nThe course is taught for three periods a week. Although it's the happy subject, the pupils themselves insist it is no laughing matter.\n\"In the first period, we had to each say something positive about another member of the class and about ourselves. No laughing at people,\" said Fanny, 17.\nResearch by the school shows it is not the first to start happiness classes: they also exist at some US universities, mainly based on positive thinking, using findings from studies of depression.",
