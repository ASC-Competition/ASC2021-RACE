  "article": "Dear Susan,\nToday is Wednesday. I'm very happy because I have a history class in the morning. Our history teacher, Mr. Meng, always tells us some history stories. I think they're quite interesting.\nBut my good friend, Chen Kun, doesn't like Wednesday. He doesn't like history. He thinks it's difficult. He can't understand our history teacher. He loves Chinese because he can read his favourite novels  in this class.\nLin Xiao's favourite day is Thursday. She likes music. She can sing and dance in the class. She loves the music teacher, Miss Zhang, because her class is quite relaxing . She thinks Miss Zhang is very beautiful.\nYours,\nJane",
