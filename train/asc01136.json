  "article": "In this century the traditional American family is constantly faced with the threat of breakdown. Some people suggest that one little - noticed cause may be the introduction of the TV dinner.\nBefore the appearance of television seats, the American dinner was a big event for the family. In many homes dinner time may be the only time when everyone got together. A typical dinner was usually in three periods In the preparation period, the children and Father frequently helped with setting while Mother put the last touches on the roast. In the eating period, family members shared the day's experiences and more than food was eaten. In this period,families got to know one another and made joint decisions around the dinner table, and thus the family solidarity  was strengthened. In the cleaning - up period,children or Father again gave their hands, so that their meaning to the home community was clear. Unfortunately, all of these have been abandoned by a product--the television set.\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, the typical American family dinner was just twenty minutes long. The speed - up of this once - leisurely experiences is clearly connected to the overall pace of modern life and maybe a model of the modern life is the TV dinners--meals designed to be used between the opening and closing credits of a half - hour program. The once family affair has now become nothing more than the use of a fork and knife.",
