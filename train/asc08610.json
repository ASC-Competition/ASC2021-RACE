  "article": "Confucius was born five hundred and fifty years before Christ. Unlike Jesus Christ, he did not bring words of God to the people. He was a clever teacher and a philosopher, looking for truth and wisdom. Most of his teaching was about life in this world.\n     Confucius was very keen to give people good rulers. Someone asked him, \"What does a country need?\" Confucius answered, \"Enough food, a good army, and a good leader.\" The people then asked, \"Which one is the most important?\" Confucius answered, \"An army is not very important. All men must die, so food is not the most important. But if the leader of the country is not good, then everything will be bad,\"",
