  "article": "A friend is better than fortune. A friend is worse than poison in some cases.\nThe two sentences above have opposite meanings and seem to be unreasonable, but they can be explained as follows: the first refers to all good friends who drive us towards good while the second all bad ones who lead us into bad ways.\nMy ideal friend is of course a good friend whose goodness is shown below -- he has no bad habits, such as smoking and drinking. He lives in frugality  . He studies hard so as not to waste his golden time. At home he honors his parents and loves his brothers; at school he respects his teachers and shares the feelings of his classmates. He treats those truly who are true to him. In a word, he has all the good characteristics that I don't have. I can follow him as a model. With his help I can be free from all difficulties.\nIndeed, if I have such a person as my friend, I shall never fear difficulty and I shall never know the existence of the word \"failure\".",
