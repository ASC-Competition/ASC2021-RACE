  "article": "How good are U.S. drivers?\nThe CBS TV \"National Drivers Test\" showed that many U.S. drivers have a lot to learn. Here's why:\nCBS picked 1,799 samples  to take the test in TV studios in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Los Angeles. More than two out of five of the drivers failed the test. And the average score was the lowest passing mark-51 points out of a possible 80.\nChicago drivers did best with an average of 53 points. Los Angeles drivers came next with 52 points. New York and Philadephia drivers tied  with 50 points-a failing score. Drivers with 50 points or less were rated  \"poorly informed\" by the judges.\nHere are some of the test results:\n(1) Are men better informed drivers than women?-Yes. Men averaged 52 points. Women got average of 49.\n(2) Are older drivers better informed than younger drivers?-No. Drivers under 26 averaged 52 points. Drivers from 27 to 45 averaged 51. Driver over 45 failed with 48 points on average.\n(3) Does education make a difference?-Yes. College graduates averaged 52 points. High school graduates averaged 50. Those without high school diplomas  got 48. And people who had taken driver education courses scored an average of 53 points-three more than those who hadn't.\n(4) Does driving experience make a difference?-Yes. Drivers with three or more years' experience averaged 51 points. Drivers with less experience averaged 49.\nHere are some surprising facts brought out by the test:\n(1)More than one out of three drivers did not know that a blinking  red light means a full stop. (2)Three out of ten drivers did not know that an octagonal (eight-sided) sign means stop.\n(3)More than two of three drivers did not know what to do when being \"tailgated\"(,) The answer: slow down, drive to the right, and let the driver behind pass.\nThe results of the test were turned over to the National Safety Council. They will help future safety planning.",
