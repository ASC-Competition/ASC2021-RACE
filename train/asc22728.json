  "article": "Be careful on April 1st! When your classmates say \"Your shoes untied !\", it may not be true. And if you find your alarm clock is set back an hour, this may be a joke too.\nApril Fool's Day is a traditional festival. On that day people play harmless  jokes on others and then shout, \"April Fool!\" It's a \"for-fun-only\" day, so people don't buy gifts or get the day off work or school.\nApril Fool's Day started in France in the 16th century . At that time, New Year's Day was between March 25th and April 1st. When New Year's Day changed to January 1st in the mid-1560s, some people still celebrate it on April 1st. Others played jokes on them and called them \"April Fools\".\nEach country celebrates April Fool's Day differently. In France, it is called \"April Fish\". The Frenchmen fool their friends by sticking   paper fish to their friends' backs. When someone finds out this joke, they shout, \"April Fish!\" In England, it is bad luck to play an April Fool's joke on someone in the afternoon. Americans play small tricks on friends and strangers alike.",
