  "article": "Do you feel a little sleepy after lunch? Well, that's normal  . Your body slows down then. What should you do about it? Don't drink coffee! Instead, take a nap  .\nIt's good to have a daily nap. First of all, you are more energetic after napping. You remember things better and make fewer mistakes. Also, you can learn things more easily after taking a nap. A nap may improve your self-confidence   and make you more active. It may even cheer you up. But, there are some rules you should think about taking a nap.\nFirst, take a nap in the middle of day.\nNext, a 20-minute nap is best. If you sleep longer, you may fall into a deep sleep. After waking from a deep sleep, you will feel worse. Also, you should set an alarm clock. That way, you can fully relax during your nap. You won't have to keep looking at the clock so you don't sleep too much.\nNow, the next time you feel sleepy after lunch, don't get stressed. Put your head down, close your eyes, and take a nap.",
