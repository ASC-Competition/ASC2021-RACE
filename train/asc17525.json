  "article": "Listening test is one of the most important parts of the English exam. Here are some tips for you.\nBefore you start to listen, you need to relax. Don't be stressed out. And try to read the questions. These questions usually help you understand the conversation or the passage.\nThen listen carefully to the first sentence. It usually tells you the main idea of the passage. When you're listening, try to do some thinking and take some notes, such as:\nWhat happened?\nWhen, where, and how?\nWhat does the speaker want to tell us?\nIn this way, you may understand the passage better.\nPlease remember not to think about one or two words for a long time. When you hear some words you don't know, don't spend too much time on them. Very often, you'll find out what they mean later when you go on with the listening.",
