  "article": "We have dreams almost every night. Do you ever notice the colors of your dreams? Do you dream in black and white or do you dream in yellow, red and green?\nNew research suggests that the type of television you watched as a child has a great effect on the color of your dreams.\nWhile almost all people under 25 dream in color, thousands of people over 55, all of whom were brought up with black and white TV sets, often dream in monochrome . \n\"It suggests there could be a critical period in our childhood when watching films has a big impact on the way dreams are formed\", said Eva Murzyn, a psychology student at Dundee University in Britain who carried out the study.\nResearch from 1915 through the 1950s suggested that the vast majority of dreams are in black and white. But the tide  turned in the sixties, and later results suggested that up to 83 percent of dreams contain some color.\nSince this period also marked the transition  between black-and-white film and TV and Technicolor ,an obvious explanation was that the media had been painting people's dreams. However, there weren't any firm conclusions.\nBut now Miss Murzyn believes she has proven the link. She made a survey of more than 60 people, half of whom were over 55 and half of whom were under 25.\nShe asked the volunteers to answer a questionnaire on the color of their dreams and their childhood exposure to film and TV.\nShe then analyzed her own data. Only 4.4 percent of the under-25s' dreams were black and white. The over-55s who had had access to color TV and film during their childhood also reported a very low proportion of just 7.3 percent.\nBut the over-55s who only had access to black-and -white media reported dreaming in black and white about a quarter of the time.\nEven though they would have spent only a few hours a day watching TV or films, their attention and emotion would have been heightened during this time, leaving a deeper imprint on their mind, Miss Murzyn told the New Scientist.\n\"The crucial time is between three and ten when we all begin to have the ability to dream\", she said.",
