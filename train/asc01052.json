  "article": "One woman in nine will develop breast cancer   over her lifetime. However, a healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing the disease by 40 to 60 percent.\nGenerally speaking, eating more vegetables can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer by 60 percent. Vegetables like cabbage are rich in fiber  , can lower your risk of developing breast cancer. To get the most from their goodness, it's recommended that you eat at least three to four cups of these vegetables per week.\nIt's the oleic acid   contained in olive oil. American scientists conducting laboratory research have observed that oleic acid has a beneficial effect on breast cancer cells. Olive oil is the richest source of this acid, so whenever possible, use it in place of butter.\nEating fruit is another excellent way to help prevent the development of breast cancer. In fact, women who do eat fruit are six percent less likely to develop the disease. The American Institute for Cancer Research considers berries   (blueberries, strawberries, etc.) to be powerful for breast cancer fighters.\nIt's the lycopene  , found in great quantities in tomatoes, that can reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. The lycopene found in canned tomatoes is more readily absorbed by the body than that contained in fresh ones, so add tomato juice, paste, and sauce to your diet.\nAs a result of various studies, the American Institute for Cancer Research has concluded that components   found in green tea can help halt the development of cancerous tumours   and even prevent them from appearing in the first place. Three cups a day will help you get the benefits of green tea.",
