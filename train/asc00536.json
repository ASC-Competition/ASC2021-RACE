  "article": "From Rome and Venice to the rolling hills of Tuscany and the charm of Milan, Italy is a bottomless well of attractions. It is a motherland of artists and scientists that changed the shape of the world. Here are some places you should see on your vacations to Italy.\nValley of the Temples\nWelcome to Sicily and one of its most amazing attractions. The Valley of the Temples in Agrigento is an extensive archaeological site containing the well-preserved remains of various Doric temples dating from the 5thcentury B.C. In accord with standard criteria   for both Greek and Roman temples, all structures face east so that the statue of the god housed inside will be illuminated   by the rising sun. The site being located on a ridge overlooking the town, the term \"valley\" is obviously a misnomer  ,but it quite captures the vastness of the place.\nUffizi Gallery\nThe reputation for being one of the finest universally acclaimed   museums of all time comes courtesy of masters like Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo and Rubens. Their timeless works are proudly displayed on the top floor of the palace in Florence.\nHistoric Centre of Siena\nSiena may not equal Florence in overall artistic achievement, but its charm makes it a place that no other can compare to. Centered on Piazza del Campo, the historic district is a container of 12th-century Gothic, and a mirror of the Middle Ages. Full of pearls of architecture and cultural highlights, the historic centre of Siena is an excellent trip back in time, ideally to be taken in summer.\nGrand Canal\nTaking the water bus along the Canal Grande is like going back through centuries of history. The famous Venetian waterway runs more than 3.5 km through all six districts of the historic center. The impressive Renaissance palaces rub shoulders with Gothic arches and marble mixes with gold. Numerous landmarks never cease to provoke   admirable sighs on the way.",
