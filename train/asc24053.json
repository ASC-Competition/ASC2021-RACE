  "article": "Taking care of small children is one of the ways to make money.It is also called babysitting.Most parents do not have relatives living with them.They need someone to watch the children if they want to go out.A babysitter may play games, draw pictures, or read stories to the children, and then put them to bed at the proper time.\nMowing lawns for the neighbors is another common job.When people do not have time to mow their lawns in the garden, they are glad to pay somebody to do this.\nBoys and girls can also help deliver newspapers in the neighborhood.They can walk or ride bicycles to deliver newspapers from house to house.They must do this every day if they want to make money in this way.\nSome old people who live by themselves need help.Let them know if you like to help with the clean-up work, or go out to mail letters or buy things for them.They will perhaps pay you something each time or every week.\nThere are many ways to make money.American children often look around to see what work they can do to earn their pocket money.",
