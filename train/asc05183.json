  "article": "An independent college claimed to have become the first school in England to make Chinese a compulsory   subject for its pupils.\nRichard Cairns, the headmaster of Brighton College, said the move aims to recognize the importance of China as the world's fastest growing economy.\nChinese will become one of the core subjects at the 1,200-pupil college from September. At present the school has only a \"handful\" of native Chinese students, but it hopes to attract more in the future.\nMr Cairns, who made the announcement in his first week as head of the high-achieving college, said, \"One of my key tasks is to make sure that the pupils at Brighton College are equipped for the realities of the 21st century, and one of those realities is that China has the fastest growing economy in the world.\n\"China has replaced Britain as the world's fourth-largest economy. We in Britain need to face up to this challenge, see it for the trading opportunity that it is, and ensure that our nation's children are well-placed to thrive   in this new global reality.\n\"A better understanding of the language and culture of China will be hugely important to the advantage of the children of Brighton College.\"\nMr Cairns said he hoped the Chinese children already at the college would help and encourage their fellow pupils to learn their language.\nIn order to lead the way, Mr Cairns, a historian from Oxford, plans to take part in the first Chinese class as a pupil. \"I have agreed to join the first Chinese class as a pupil. I think it is the best way for me to show the pupils here how important I regard this new addition to our core subjects.\"",
