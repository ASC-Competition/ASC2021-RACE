  "article": "Katy Marsh is seventy years old now. She stopped working five years ago. Last year she decided to make her dream come true.\nWhen she was young, she hoped to travel along a river of Scotland  in a small boat. She took her small CD player, her hot water bottle and a bag of books to make her life in the boat wasn't too uncomfortable. We asked her if she was afraid of  being on the river for so long.

Anyway I'm not afraid of death  because I love rivers-I just hope it loves me too. \" Katy certainly had lots of energy  .

She had a wonderful trip in the small boat last year.\nShe is seventy, but she doesn't want to have a quiet and peaceful life. She hopes to have fun in the rest  of her life.",
