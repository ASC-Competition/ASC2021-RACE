  "article": "International travel has become popular. So, what can we do to enjoy ourselves and also leave a lasting, good impression on the people and places we visit? It goes without saying that we should respect local customs and beliefs. Therefore, a little research into the area where you are travelling may help you.\nPay attention to how people greet each other. In Western countries such as America, it is common to shake hands and look at one another in the eyes when you are greeting someone. In other countries people prefer not to touch each other when they meet.\nFor example, in Thailand, it is considered to be _ to put your hand on someone's head, especially children's. The head is considered sacred  and by touching someone on their head you can prevent their spiritual growth.\nEveryone likes to relax when traveling. This can also include wearing more casual or different clothing. It is always good to keep in mind the local culture about dressing. For example, if you go to a country with strong religious beliefs such as those in the Middle East, all of above are banned. So, it is always good to dress modestly, such as in dark-colored clothes.\nThe better you prepare the more fun you will have. If you are aware of the special foods and customs and have learnt some simple expressions, you might be lucky enough to find yourself invited to a local festival of gathering where you can experience something very special. By meeting some local people you could also discover some special attractions or places of interest.",
