  "article": "At the end of my senior year of high school, I got a job working at a local coffee shop.I thought the job would be easy and stress-free.I pictured myself pouring the best coffees, making delicious doughnuts  , and becoming friends with regular customers.\nI wasn't expecting the people with enormous orders, the women who complained that the coffee was much too creamy  , or the men who wanted their iced coffees remade again and again until they reached perfection.I couldn't seem to please anyone.\nOne rainy day, one of my regular customers came in looking upset.He said he felt like getting in bed, pulling the sheets up over his head, and staying there for a few years.I knew exactly how he felt.\nBefore he left, I handed him a bag along with his iced coffee.He was surprised, since he hadn't ordered anything but coffee.I had given him his favorite type of droughnut.\n\"It's on me,\" I told him.\"Have a nice day.\"\nHe smiled and thanked me before heading back out into the rain.\nThe next day, it was still raining.I spent my afternoon hanging out the window handing people their orders.I was completely wet and freezing cold.Worse, no one was tipping that day.Every time I looked into our empty tip jar, I grew more depressed.\nIn the evening, the customer from the day before drove up to the window.He handed me a pink rose and a note.He said that not many people took time to care about others and he was glad there were still people like me in the world.With a friendly wave, he drove away.\nI ran to the back of the shop and read the note.It read:\nChristine,\nThanks for being so sweet, kind and thoughtful yesterday.It is so nice to meet someone who's indeed nice.Please don't change your ways! Have a great day! -Hank\nAfter that, whenever I felt depressed or sick of coffee, I thought of Hank and his kindness.Then I would smile, hold my head up high, clear my throat and ask politely, \"How can I help you?\"",
