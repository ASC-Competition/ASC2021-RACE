But last Monday, students from Shanghai and Zhejiang had an even better excuse: a typhoon !\nTyphoon Khanun hit East China on September 11. In Shanghai, all the school were closed the next day, Monday.\nIt was the first time that Shanghai had to close schools because of  bad weather.\nBut some students still came to school that day. \" I didn't get the notice that the school was closing,\" said Shen Sheng, a Junior 2 student from Shanghai Aiguo School. \" But it was nice that we could play in school rather than study.\"\nThe school kept Shen and other 20 students safe inside and let them play sports like table tennis.\nBut the storm wasn't all fun games. Typhoon Khanun killed 14 people. In Zhejiang, it _ about 8,000 houses. More than one million people had to be taken to safer places.\nEvery year, typhoons hit different places around the world. Most happen in July, August and September. This year 15 typhoons hit China. Khanun was the strongest. Typhoons bring strong winds and rains. The winds can blow away houses and cars. The rains are bad for farmers' fields.\nTyphoon also kills people. Earlier this month, Typhoon Talim hit East and Central China. It killed at least 124 people.",
