  "article": "I am peter Hodes ,a volunteer stem courier. Since  March 2012, I've done 89 trips of those , 51 have been abroad, I have 42 hours to carry stem cells in my little box because I've got two ice packs and that's how long they last, in all, from the time the stem cells are harvested from a donor  to the time they can be implanted in the patient, we've got 72 hours at most, So I am always conscious of time. &\nI had one trip last year where I was caught by a hurricane in America. I picked up the stem cells in Providence, Rhode Island, and was meant to fly to Washington then back to London. But when I arrived at the check-in desk at Providence, the lady on the desk said:\"Well, I'm really sorry, I've got some bad news for you-there are no fights from Washington.\"So I took my box and put it on the desk and I said:\"In this box are some stem cells that are urgently needed for a patient-please, please, you've got to get me back to the United Kingdom.\"She just dropped everything. She arranged for a flight on a small  plance to be held for me.re-routed me through Newark and got me back to the UK even earlier than originally scheduled.\nFor this courier job, you're consciously aware than that box you're got something that is potentially going to save somebody's life.",
