  "article": "Joker found one of the biggest diamonds in the world in his own back yard. He sold the stone to a diamond dealer for over three hundred thousand dollars. In New York, the diamond was resold. This time for almost eight hundred thousand dollars. The true value of a diamond is never known until it has been cut. Once cut successfully, its value can increase a thousand times. It's easy to understand why the owner of the Joker diamond went to the best diamond cutter he knew, Kaplan. The cutter studied the diamond for twelve whole months.\nWhen he felt he was ready to start work, he discovered a flaw  . He had to begin with his calculations   all over again, or he might have made the stone useless. Six more months passed, and Kaplan finally said to the owner, \"I m ready to start my work. There will be one excellent diamond that be comparable to any in the world, plus eleven small diamonds of first-class quality.\" Kaplan waited a few more days until be felt he was in the best physical and mental   condition possible. He picked up his tools and held his breath as he made the first blow. The diamond split   exactly as he promised.",
