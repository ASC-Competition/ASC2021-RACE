Every night, when he went to bed, he closed his eyes and tried to sleep . But he couldn't. He thought: \"I must go to see the doctor.\" He said to the doctor. \"I can't go to sleep at night.\" \"Try counting numbers. When you reach one thousand, you'll be asleep.\" The next day the man came back to the doctor's office. \"Well,\" said the doctor, \"How are you today?\"\n\"Yes, he said,\" I tried counting one, two, three. . . up to  one thousand. But when I reached five hundred and sixty-nine, I began to feel sleepy  . I had to get up and drank some tea. Then I went on counting up to one thousand. But I still couldn't fall asleep.",
