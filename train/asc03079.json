  "article": "I'm often told how I have a dream job, that I work for a great company, getting to deal with the leaders in social media every day, and especially that I get to work from my home.\nUsually the people who tell me that working from home is wonderful have never worked fromhome.  They spend most of their career working from an office and hate it.\nIn fact, I love being able to work from home and make my own hours. I truly appreciate beingable to drop what I'm doing to attend kids or go shopping, but there's a side to it we don't often talk about, the hard side. No one wants to believe people like me, working from home, have anything tocomplain about. Really, I'm not going to complain, but I do want to share a few things about telecommuting   that few home-based people want to tell you, because working from home doesn't look so wonderful.\nOne of the reasons I love my job is the flexibility . I know that I can volunteer for school projects,meet friends for lunch and work out for an hour as long as I get my work done. But did you know telecommuters have to make up the time if they wish to fill their days with fun items? Sowhile my husband and kids are watching a movie, I'm working until midnight. Besides, when youwork from home, you're held to your phone and Skype   in case someone wants to talk toyou during business hours. So it's not so easy to be flexible!",
