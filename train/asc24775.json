Now they're standing at the bus stop and waiting for the bus. She sees her friend Jim and his grandpa there.\n\"Good morning, grandpa!\" says the girl. \"Are you going to the zoo, too?\"\n\"Yes, we are,\" says the old man. Then he says to Mary's father, \"You have a polite daughter. How old is she?\"\n\"Eight, grandpa.\" answers the girl.\n\"Eight?\" the old man says with a smile. \"But you're shorter than my stick!\"\n\"How old is your stick, then?\" says the girl.",
