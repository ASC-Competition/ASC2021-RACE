  "article": "Last month,my younger sister Michelle,four of my friends and I held our first charity art exhibitions.The exhibitions, containing 140 paintings,raised 44,000 yuan,all donated to Stepping Stones,a charity that supports poor children in China.\nEver since l was a little girl, I have been in love with art.I have always been fascinated with the idea of creating beauty and emotion-how imagination can transform a simple piece of paper into something beyond the possibilities of the real world.I watched others create magic by simply moving their hands,and felt thrilled as I gradually learned to do _ myself.\nPassion results in creation.In nine years,I had accumulated more pieces than I could count.My finished paintings were set aside,gathering dust as time passed.So I decided to hold exhibitions to find a home and some appreciation for my artwork.\nNonetheless,I was extremely nervous.After all,I am only a l5-year-old child who has a passion,but not necessarily one who creates artwork that others want to buy.\nHowever,the turnout was more than I could ever have imagined,and the amount of money we raised quadrupled our original target.We were very lucky to find a charity,Stepping Stone,that would show us exactly how our money would be used:to teach English to poor children in the country.I was even offered an opportunity to teach the children myself.\nThrough this experience,I not only gained more confidence in my art,but also discovered its impact.I realized a paintbrush could paint not only a canvas,but also new opportunities for others who don't have as many choices in who they want to be,or what they want to do.Although this cannot transform the world,this may transform the world for one child,or even more.",
