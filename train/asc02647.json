  "article": "The evidence for harmony may not be clear in some families. But it seems that four in five young people now get on with their parents, which is the opposite of the popularly- held image of unhappy teenagers locked in their room after endless family quarrels.\nAn important new study into teenage attitudes surprisingly shows that their family life is more harmonious than it has ever been in the past. \"We were surprised by just how positive today's young people seem to be about their families, \"said one member of the research team. \"They're expected to be rebellious  and selfish but actually they have other things on their minds; they want a car and material goods, and they worry about whether school is serving them well. There's more negotiation  and discussion between parents and children, and children expect to take part in the family decision-making process. They don't want to rock the boat. \"\nSo it seems that this generation of parents is much more likely than parents of 30 years ago to treat the children as friends. \"My parents are happy to discuss things with me and willing to listen to me, \"says 17-years-old Daniel Lazall. \"I always tell them when I'm going out clubbing. As long as they know what I'm doing, they're fine with it. \"Susan Crome, who is now 21, agrees. \"Looking back on the last 10 years, there was a lot of what you could call negotiation. For example, as long as I'd done all my homework, I could go out on a Saturday night. But I think my grandparents were a lot stricter with my parents than that. \"\nMaybe this positive view of family life should not be unexpected. It is possible that the idea of teenagers' rebellion is not rooted in real facts. A researcher comments, \"Our surprise that teenagers say they get along well with their parents comes because of a brief period in out social history when teenagers were regarded as different beings. But that idea of rebelling and breaking away from their parents really only happened during that one time in the 1960s when everyone rebelled. The normal situation throughout history has been a smooth change from helping out with the family business to taking it over. \"",
