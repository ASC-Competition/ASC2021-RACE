  "article": "Lomography was first officially introduced to China when the Lomography World Congress was held in Beijing in July, 2004. The Lomography World Congress is the greatest annual event of the Lomographic Society. It has been held in Madrid, New York, Tokyo, Cologne and Vienna, etc. The 2004's _   took place in Beijing and ran a full week.\nThe first non-official affair of Chinese Lomographers was held in August, 2005 and it attracted much attention. A lot of energetic young people got together under the banner of \"I Loma you\" which was the slogan of this big party. In China Lomo is more of a symbol of fashion and youth, and most of the Lomographers are stylish young people who work with or study art. The organizer told the editor that the oldest Lomographer who came here is in his forties while the youngest one is about nine years old, but most of the people who are into Lomo are about 20 years old. In China the concept of Lomography is not only about Lomographyer taking photos with Lomo camera, but also a kind of spirit. \"I think, generally, the Lomo spirit is everyone trying to love one's own life and discover the beauty of everyday life,\" the organizer said, \"what I think more important is the idea of freedom and creativity. The 10 th Golden Rule is 'don't worry about any rules', I think it introduces to us a concept: It's you who make the rules and it's you who break the rules. So free your mind and let your creativity work, and your life will be fantastic.\"",
