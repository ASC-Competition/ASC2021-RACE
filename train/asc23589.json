  "article": "Mr. Smith works in a factory. There he drives a truck. He's tired all the time. When he comes back, he's always busy and doesn't want to do any housework. His wife is a doctor and likes to keep all the things clean. So she has to do all at home. She usually goes to work from Monday to Friday and has to do all on weekends. All her friends know about it and sometimes they come to help her.\nIt's Saturday today. Mrs Smith tells her husband to help her do some housework, but he says he has something to do and goes out early in the morning. He leaves a lot of dirty clothes at home. Mrs Smith doesn't go to work but she doesn't feel well. So she doesn't want to do any housework. After breakfast, Jo, one of her friends, comes to see her when she's sitting on a chair.\nThe girl finds the rooms are dirty and she asks, \"Don't you clean your rooms today, Mrs Smith?\" \"No, I don't.\"says the doctor. \"Why don't you wear your glasses?\" \"Then I will think the rooms are still clean.\"",
