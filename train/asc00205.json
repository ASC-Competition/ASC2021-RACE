  "article": "I Online shopping started not so long ago. Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1990. The first online bank opened in 1994. In 1995, Amazon started operating and is not one of the largest online shopping malls. Then in 1996, eBay started its online shopping site.\nBy sitting at home you can now buy anything from knives to cars. The worry you may have about traveling and parking can be avoided while you shop online. With online shopping, you need not worry about the weather. Online shops have no holidays, closing times or any other problem. You can shop 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year. Some online shops also keep customers' opinions about each product, so you can easily find out what other customers think about the product before buying it.\nWhen you go for real-world shopping, you can actually touch and feel it, but in online shopping you can only see the pictures. Also if you are shopping online, you have to be careful with your credit cards.\nThe first step in online shopping is to search for what you want to buy. Once you find the required product, put it in a \"shopping cart\" and continue shopping. After you have got enough in your \"shopping cart\", check out the product. You can add or take out the products in your shopping cart. The next step is to log in using a username and a password. Enter the address where you want the product to be sent. Some sites even ask for your email, phone numbers, etc.\nThen wait for the confirmation of your order. You can also cancel the order if needed. Online shopping is a different experience and you can make shopping online easy when you get used to it.",
