  "article": "Almost every day, we discuss the topic of health, especially for kids. But what is health? \"Health\" means eating well, getting enough exercise, and having a healthy weight. Let's read the following rules. They can help you stay healthy.\n1 Eat _ foods, especially fruit and vegetables. We all know that eating fruit and vegetables can help us stay healthy, but many of us only eat our favorite foods. Remember that we can only get the nutrition  we need by eating different kinds of food, especially fruit and vegetables.\n2 Drink water and milk most often. Everyone knows that water is important. Besides that, kids need plenty of calcium  to grow strong bones, and milk has a lot of it. Every day, you should drink at least three cups of milk (1300 milligrams of calcium), when you are 9 years old or older. You should also try to have less sugary drinks, like soda and coca. They include a lot of sugar. Sugar just includes calories, not important nutrition.\n3 Listen to your body. When you are eating, notice how your body feels. When your stomach feels comfortably full, stop eating. Eating too much makes you feel uncomfortable. If you do it too often, it can make you unhealthy and fat.\n4 Limit  screen time. What's screen time? It's the amount of time you spend watching TV, movies, and playing computer games. The more time you spend on these sitting-down activities, the less time you spend playing sports, like basketball, and doing other activities like bike riding and swimming. Try to spend no more than 2 hours a day on screen time.",
