  "article": "A farmer grew some vegetables in his garden. One day his wife was ill and he had no money. He had to sell some cabbages and carrots in the market. The next morning he took two baskets of vegetables to town. But it was raining hard that afternoon and there were few people in the street. When his vegetables were sold out, it was dark. He bought some medicine and hurried to his village.\nOn his way home he saw a person lying on the snow. He placed his baskets on the ground and was going to help the person to get up. At that time he found it was a dead man and there was much blood on his body. He was so afraid that he ran away quickly, without taking the baskets with him.\nThe next afternoon the farmer was sent to the police station. Having shown the baskets, an officer asked: \"Are these yours?\" \"Yes, sir.\" the farmer answered timidly . \"Have you killed the man?\" \"No, no, sir.\" the farmer said in a hurry.\" When did you see the dead man?\" \"About seven last evening.\" \"Did you see who killed the man?\" \"No, Sir.\" The officer brought out a knife and asked, \"Have you seen it yet?\" \"No, Sir.' The officer became angry and told the policemen to beat him up and send him into prison.\nThat evening the officer went on trying .Pointing to the knife, he asked again,\" Have you seen it yet?\" \"Yes, Sir.\" The officer was happy and asked,\" When and where?\" \"I saw it here this afternoon, sir.\"",
