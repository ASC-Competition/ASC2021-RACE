  "article": "Each year, road accidents kill a million people and injure millions more. The economic costs are greatest for developing countries. Earlier this year, the United Nations called for a campaign to improve road safety.\nOne way to avoid accidents is better driving. Another is better roads and bridges. Engineers in the Unites States have designed ten new concrete mixtures that they think could make bridges last longer.\nProfessor Paul Tikalsky leads the experiments by a team at Pennsylvania State University. He says bridges made of concrete now last about twenty-five to thirty-five years. But he says the new mixtures might extend that to seventy-five or even one-hundred years.\nConcrete is made of stone, sand, water and cement . The materials in the cement hold the concrete together. Ancient Romans built with concrete. Yet strengthened concrete bridges did not appear until the late 1800s. People keep looking for new ways to improve concrete. Professor Tikalsky says it is one of the most complex of all chemical systems.\nThe new mixtures designed by his team contain industrial waste products. He says these make the concrete better able to resist damage from water and salt over time. One of the products is fly ash. This is released into the air as pollution when coal is burned.\nProfessor Tikalsky says particles   of fly ash are almost exactly the same size and chemical structure as Portland cement. _ is the most costly material in concrete. So using fly ash to replace some of it would save money.\nThe federal government is paying for part of the research. Engineers anywhere can use the technology. Professor Tikalsky says some of the ideas have already been put to use in China, the Philippines and other countries.",
