  "article": "Every time I lost a tooth I would put it under my pillow at night. The next morning I would wake up to find two coins replacing my tooth. Then I'd wonder about the tooth fairy all day.\n\"Mom, where do you think the tooth fairy lives? What does she do with the teeth she collects?\"\nMy mom said she didn't know. She only knew that the tooth fairy took the tooth away while we were sleeping and left us some money under our pillow. But I wanted to find out. So I think it was a good thing that I would lose another tooth. The plan was to stay up all night and ask the tooth fairy when she showed up.\nThat night I lay quietly in my bed, growing sleepy as the night went on. Moments later, I felt that someone was close to me. Through my half-opened eyes, I didn't see any feet, but I knew it was the tooth fairy. I watched her run around and fly right out of my room. She was wearing a shiny green dress. After she left, I immediately felt under my pillow. There were two coins. I had never even felt my pillow move. I wondered if she used magic.\nAs I got older, I learned from my teachers that the tooth fairy didn't exist. It was just a mythical figure of early childhood. I kind of thought it was, but how could I see the tooth fairy fly that night?\nThen one night my mom came into my room to check on me. The moonlight was bright that night and it shone through my window right on her shiny green nightdress. Right then I knew deep down that my mom was the tooth fairy.",
