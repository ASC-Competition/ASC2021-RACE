  "article": "Dear Uncle Horton,\nWe just want to let you know what a great weekend we had with you while we were in Boise. You are a fantastic guide and it was so nice of you to have taken us out for a tour of the city.  The sights were beautiful and our two girls loved the Discovery Centre very much. They are still talking about it.\nWe are not sure when we'll meet again, but we hope it won't be too long. Please let us know of any plans you might have to visit New York. We would love you to visit us and we hope to have the pleasure of taking you around New York City.\nThanks again for a truly great weekend.\nMuch love,\nDick and Kate\nDear.Mum,\nHappy Mother's Day! Since I have my own kid, I have got to know how hard mothering is. Thank you for being so patient with me through my ups and downs. I hope I can be as good a mother to Lily as you are to me. Thanks for being such a good mum. Whether you come to visit me or we talk on the phone, l always feel we're so close. You're always my best friend.  I hope you know how much I love you!\nHelen\n,.",
