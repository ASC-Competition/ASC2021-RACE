He hopes his students can be honest and is strict with them. Some of his students become famous persons,but they still remember him and often write to him. Of course the old man is proud of it.\nThis term he began to teach Grade One. Some of the new students were told about him, but the others didn't know him well. He told them how to be an honest person. He gave them several examples and said,\"I hate telling a lie most.\"\nBefore class was over,he told all his students to finish Exercise 8 in Unit 1.The next morning,as soon as he came in the classroom,he asked,\"Who's finished Exercise 8? \"\nA few students put up their hands. He shook his head and said. \"Open your workbooks and see if there's Exercise 8 in Unit 1 or not.\"\nThe students had a look at their books and their faces turned red at once.",
