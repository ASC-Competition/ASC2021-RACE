  "article": "I would recommend uVolunteer Programs in Costa Rica  to anyone. Everyone can learn something and enjoy their time here if they have the ability to adapt to different circumstances and a sense of adventure.\nI came to San Ramon---the capital of Costa Rica, hardly knowing any Spanish, so the first thing I did there was to take Spanish courses at Spanish Language School for a week. My family stay was also of great help to my language study, but that experience with the classes gave me _ on the language, which has been extremely valuable.\nOnce in San Ramon, I was fortunate enough to experience several projects with amazing people. I taught Adult English Night Classes, helped at an elementary school, and also went to the Community Center in Bajo. The adult classes are just so awesome because it can be really engaging, social, and fun while being educational. We all learned a lot from each other and became pretty close. The Sabana School was a nice elementary school right by the dorm. The kids were so incredibly nice, even giving me lots of hugs and small gifts. I came at a time when there were many holiday celebrations so there were some scheduling challenges, resulting in me being there to assist English classes a couple of hours in the morning. I decided to go to Bajo in the afternoons. I, like all of the other volunteers, absolutely loved it. This is a place where I felt I was really helping in a more significant way. The kids started to open up more to me the more I was there playing with the kids and helping with the educational programs. The staff and kids are just incredible.\nAside from work, we decided on some weekend trips. By the end of my stay I had experienced hot volcanic springs in La Fortuna, snorkeling and hiking with incredible wildlife in Puerto Viejo, caving in Nicaragua, and kayaking and night fishing (we ate the fish too) in Playa Hermosa. I also enjoyed dancing, eating, and watching performances during the San Ramon festivals.",
