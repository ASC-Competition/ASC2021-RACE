  "article": "John is a very strong man. He gets a job of cutting  trees in a forest. His boss gives him an axe and showed him the area where he should work.\nThe first day, John cuts down 18 trees. \"Good,\" the boss says, \"keep it up!\" happily, John  tries harder the next day, but he only cuts down 15 trees. The third day he tries even harder, but he can only cut down 10 trees. Day after day he cuts down fewer and fewer trees.\n\"I must be losing my strength ,\" John thinks. He goes to the boss to say sorry and says that he can not know what is going on. \"When is the last time you sharpen  your axe?\"  the boss asks. \"I'm busy cutting trees, so I have no time to do _ . \"\nThe moral of this story: While John is working hard, he doesn't work \"smart\". He doesn't think about the best way to do his job.",
