  "article": "The young boy was sitting on the ground in the refugee camp playing with an empty tin.Other children were standing around watching him with envious eyes.\nEnvy?  Of an empty tin?\nThis tin was indeed no worthless piece of trash--it was a splendid truck,complete with wheels and grille  and floor.The vehicle even had remote control,a frayed piece of string from the\"engine\"to the hand of the owner.\nThe tin had lost all its original markings.But its first load had probably been sardines .Later the tin had been left with other rubbish behind the refugee camp clinic,and the boy had found it on one of his daily expeditions into the\"big world\".\nFor thousands of refugee children,a tin 1ike this rates high on their list of wants.It can be used for many purposes,as jewellery,as a toy,for drinking or as a medicine box.\nMany refugee children would consider it the happiest day of their lives if they received a handful of marbles  as a present.\nThey dream of gifts which children in developed countries take for granted.Maybe a book to read.or a pencil and an exercise book of their very own.\nTheir imagination can create toys,but it cannot create books.Someone else must provide them.A more costly and valuable gift they cannot imagine.",
