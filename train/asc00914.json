I just go with the music.\" Even a rude gesture from a passing motorist doesn't bother her either. \" I just smile and wave,\" she said.\nMcElrah's show of bravery recently earned her a job opportunity with Liberty Tax Service, which temporarily offered her a job as a dancer Statute of Liberty to promote a new place near Grand Center starting in January.\n\" Just be happy and do what you love,\" she said. \"The money will come.\"",
