If the kids know how to play a new sport, maybe they will like it. Taking P.E. classes at school is a good way to learn new sports. Another way is to watch videos about sports. Kids can also read some books to learn new sports.\nSome kids don't like playing sports because they were once on a team and didn't have fun. For those kids, it's a good idea to talk with their teachers or parents. With their help, maybe the kids will like playing sports again.\nThere are many kinds of sports, so a kid should find the sports that _ him or her. If a kid doesn't like team sports, parents can ask him or her to try individual  sports, such as swimming and running.\nPlaying sports is a good form of exercise, and it can help kids keep active and healthy. Of course, non-sport   activities can also keep kids fit, such as walking a dog, cleaning the room and watering the garden.",
