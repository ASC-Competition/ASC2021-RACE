  "article": "A controversial new study has claimed that men really are more intelligent than women.The study concluded that men's IQs are almost four points higher than women's.\nBritish-born researcher John Philippe Ruston says the finding could explain why so few women make it to the top in the workplace.\nHe claims the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon is probably due to inferior intelligence,rather than lack of opportunity.\nThe University of Western Ontario psychologist reached his conclusion after _ the results of university ability tests taken by 1 00,000 students aged 17 and 18 of both sexes.\nA focus on the factors such as the ability to quickly grasp a complex concept,verbal reasoning skills and creativity-- some of the key factors of intelligence --showed the male teenagers had IQs that were an average of 3.63 points higher. The average person has an IQ around 100.The findings,which held true for all classes and levels of education, overturn 100 year opinion that men and women average the same in general mental ability. They also conflict with evidence that girls do better in school exams than boys.\nBut Professor Ruston argues that the faster maturing of girls leads to them outshining boy in the classroom.",
