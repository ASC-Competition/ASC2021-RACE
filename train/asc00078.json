  "article": "During a recent phone interview with a mom who had just moved to Colorado, the conversation turned to disaster planning.\" I am standing here looking out of the window at the smoke from wildfires,\" she told me, \"and have absolutely no idea what we will do if the wind shifts our way.\" Fortunately, the fire was put out, saving her home.\nMaking a disaster plan isn't something anyone does for fun. But being caught without one in a time of need is worse. Emergency management officials say too few families have a disaster plan ,even in areas that have been hit hard by hurricanes or flooding.\nI have prepared food, water, flashlights, candles, a battery-powered radio and firewood since our family was hit years ago by a hurricane that blocked off streets and knocked out our power for more than a week. Still we lack the medications, emergency contacts, and emergency-meeting and pet-care plans we should also have .Officials in my state of Oregon have warned us that one of us is really ready for the major disaster which is very likely to hit here---- a big earthquake.\nWorking parents need to coordinate their disaster plans with their children's schools or child-care centers. Many parents in the 2003 New York blackout weren't able to get home to their children because public traffic was stopped and lights were out. After that, many parents made detailed plans with child-care providers about where to meet in emergencies, an whom to contact if unable to reach each other.\nGood emergency planning and training helped teachers at a child-care center in the World Trade Center successfully move children to a safe place during the 2001 terrorist attacks.\nDo you have an emergency plan for your home? If not, you know what to do.",
