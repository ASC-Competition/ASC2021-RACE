  "article": "A federal agency on Tuesday called for a ban on all cellphone use by drivers -- the most far-reaching recommendation up to now -- saying its decision was based on a decade of investigations into distraction-related  accidents, as well as growing concerns that powerful mobile devices are giving drivers even more reasons to look away from the road.\nAs part of its recommendation, the National Transportation Safety Board is urging states to ban drivers from using hands-free devices, including wireless headsets. No state now has made laws to ban such activity, but the Board said that drivers faced serious risks from talking on wireless headsets, just as they do by taking a hand off the wheel to hold a phone to their ears.\nHowever, the concern was heightened by increasingly powerful phones that people can use to send e-mails, watch movies and play games.\n\"Every year, new devices are being on sale.\" she said. \"People are attracted to update their Facebook page, to play music with cellphone, as if sitting at a desk. But they are driving a car.\"\nThe agency based its recommendation on evidence from its investigation of numerous crashes in which electronic distraction was a major contributing factor.\nMs. Hersman said she understood that this recommendation would be unwelcome in some circles, given the number of drivers who talk and text. But she compared distracted driving to drunken driving and even smoking, which required wholesale cultural shifts to change behavior.\n\"It's going to be very unpopular with some people.\" she said. \"We're not here to win a popularity contest. We're here to do the right thing. This is a difficult recommendation, but it's the right recommendation and it is time.\"\nThe agency's recommendation is not required for states to adopt such a ban. And it won't likely be agreed upon by state lawmakers who are unwillingly to anger those who have grown accustomed to using their device behind the wheel.\nThe ban also deserves attention because it is the first call by a federal agency to end the practice completely, rather than the partial ban that some lawmakers have put in place by allowing hands-free talking.",
