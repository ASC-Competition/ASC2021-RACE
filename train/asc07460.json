  "article": "I always wanted to run a business of some sort,and finally I got such a good chance to do so at the beginning of the summer term.The business project is called Young Enterprise,where we set up a small company called \"Limitless\" and sold the products to the school and public.I was appointed deputy director and financial director of the company,in which my role was to manage the financial activities.\nI have learnt so much from this experience,for I could put what I have learnt into practice in real life and learn to work with different people,which improved my skills in management and communication.\nIn this school we students can organise our own activities if we want to,and the school is usually highly supportive:so this term I have organised an Engineering Society in school,which arranges regular visits to local industries.So far,the society which has only 10 members has proved to be really \"popular\".Well,it is always the quality,not the quantity,that matters,isn't it?\nI have had many opportunities to challenge myself since I got to the school,and I do think it is all of these challenges that make me more and more mature.Perhaps one of the most important lessons I have learned in this school is to have the initiative  to look for any possible challenges.",
