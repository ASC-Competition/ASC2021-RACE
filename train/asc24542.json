  "article": "New York is the biggest city of the USA. A long time ago, it was called Lenapehoking. In 1626, Dutch  people bought the land for only $24! They called it New Amsterdam. Then in 1664, the British took it over and changed the name to New York.\nNew York had an excellent harbour . Many people from all over the world came by sea and landed in New York. These people wanted a better life. New York seemed to give them that. By 1835, New York became the largest city in the United States. New York City used to have five smaller towns but now they are all part of the same city. They are Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.\nToday, New York is home to millions of people from all over the world. These different cultures make New York an exciting place to visit. There's much to do in New York. You can take a helicopter  riding through the city, ride horses in Central Park, see a movie in the afternoon and watch the sunset  over the Brooklyn Bridge. Don't worry if you get hungry. Some restaurants are open 24 hours a day!",
