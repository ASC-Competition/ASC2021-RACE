  "article": "We were going to play against a team from a country school.\nThey didn't come until the last minute. They looked worse than we had thought. They were wearing dirty blue trousers and looked like farm boys.\nWe sat down for a rest. We felt that we didn't need any practice against a team like that.\nThe game began. One of us got the ball and he shot a long pass to our forward  . From  out of nowhere a boy in an old T-shirt stopped the ball and with beautiful style  he shot and got two points. Then another two points in a minute. Soon the game was all over. We were beaten by the country team.\nAfter that, we thought a lot. We certainly learned that even though your team is very good, you can't look down upon the others and still need to do you best. And the most important lesson we learned was: One can't judge   a person or a team only by their clothes.",
