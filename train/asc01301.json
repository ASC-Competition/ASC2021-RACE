  "article": "Can you imagine a stranger will read your e-mails without your permission or scan the website you've visited or perhaps someone will casually glance through your credit card purchases or cell phones bills? All of the things may happen to you one day.\nIn fact, it's likely that some of these things have already happened to you. Who would watch you without your permission? It might be a spouse, a girlfriend, a marketing company, a boss, a cop or a criminal. Whoever it is, they will see you in a way you never intended to be seen or even do something that may bring a disaster to you.\nPsychologists tell us boundaries are healthy, and that it's important to reveal to friends, family and lovers at appropriate times. But few boundaries remain nowadays. The digital bread crumbs you leave everywhere make it easy for strangers to know who you are, where you are and what you like. In some cases, a simple Google search can leak the deepest thought in your mind. Like it or not, increasingly _ \nThe key question is: Does that matter? For many Americans, the answer apparently is \"No\".\nWhen opinion polls ask Americans about privacy, most of them say they are really concerned about losing it. And 60 percent of the respondents say they feel their privacy is \"slipping away, and that bothers me\".\nBut people say one thing and do another. Only a small of Americans change any behaviors in an effort to preserve their privacy. Few people turn down a discount at tollbooths  to avoid using the EZ-Pass system that track automobile movements. Privacy economist Acquisti has run a series of tests that reveal people will give up personal information such as telephone number, address, or social security numbers just to get their hands on a pitiful 50-cent-off coupon . But privacy does matter--at least sometimes. It's like health; when you have it, you don't notice it. Only when it's gone do you wish you'd done more to protect it. Without privacy, one will be naked in front of others.",
