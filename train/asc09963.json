  "article": "Great grandmother Lillian Lowe today claimed she is the world's oldest Facebook user at 103 -- and she updates  her status  from her iPad.\n       Just two months away from her 104thbirthday, the family of young-at-heart Lillian believe she is the oldest of the social networking website's 500 million users around the world.\n       Lillian Lowe is thought to have taken the crown  of oldest Facebook user from 104-year-old Ivy Bean who died in her sleep in July.\n       Lillian said today that she is a big fan of the social networking site. \"I love it. It is very exciting. It's a wonderful way of exploring something new. But I must say it's really a waste of time. I'm sure there are lots of other things I should be doing rather than playing on a computer.\"\n       She has 34 Facebook \"friends\" -- and her most active one is her great grand-daughter Kaylee Lowe, 10.\n       She said, \"I can recommend it to any grandparents who keep in touch with their family by telephone all the time.\"\n       Lillian was born in 1907 and she can still remember the news of the Titanicsinking in 1912.\n       Lillian said, \"I think almost everything has been invented during my time. What I particularly like now is this Google Earth.\n       \"When I was 84, I visited Australia with my younger sister Mary, who will be 100 next year.\n       \"We had a lovely trip, so yesterday I looked at Australia again on the Internet.\n       \"I've always read a lot during my life, and this computer has just taken the place of a book.\"\n       Her grandson Steve set Lillian up with her Facebook account  -- and gave her his iPad to use.\n       Steve said, \"Now and again, she might be surprised at a few of the funny teenage behaviors she sees on Facebook.\n       \"But she's pretty tolerant  and it doesn't annoy her. What's great about Grandma is that she's not afraid to take on new things and is always willing to learn -- she's a great inspiration to us all.\"",
