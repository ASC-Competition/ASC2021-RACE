  "article": "Generally speaking, government regulations normally ban anything from smoking in public places to parking in certain zones. But officials in the Brazilian town of Biritiba Mirim, 70km (45miles) east of Sao Paulo, _ . They plan to prohibit residents from dying early because the local cemetery  has reached full capacity.\nThere's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated  and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \"They have not taken local demands into consideration\", he claims.\nA 2003 decree  by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area.\nBiritiba Mirim, a town of 28,000 inhabitants, not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away. The bill also calls on people to take care of their health in order to avoid death. \"I haven't got a job, nor am I healthy. And now they say I can't die. That's ridiculous,\" Amarido do Prado, an unemployed resident said.\nThe city council is expected to vote on the regulation next week. \"Of course the bill is laughable, illegal, and will never be approved,\" said Gilson Soares de Campos, an assistant of the mayor. \"But can you think of a better resolution to persuade the government to change the environmental decree that is prohibiting us from building a new cemetery?\" The bill states that \"offenders will be held responsible for their acts.\" However, it does not say what the punishment will be.",
