  "article": "Way of Life for Students\nThe Internet is way of life for US college students, with research showing them to be one of the most connected groups.\nA recent study by Harris Interactive and 360 Youth found that 93 percent of American college students visit the Internet, and this market is expected to grow from 15.2 million in 2003 to 16.4 million in 2007. That is slow but could be the result of the already high number of college Internet users.\nAbout 88 percent of American college students own a computer, and more than half have broadband connections. Furthermore, 67 percent own cell phones and 36 percent use their mobile devices to visit the Internet. Study findings are that 42 percent go online mainly to communicate socially, and 72 percent of college students check emails at least once a day, with 66 percent using at least two email addresses.\nThe most popular online social activity is forwarding messages to friends or family, with 37 percent of college students saying they do so. The study also looked beyond the Internet surfing habits and into the buying habits of this group, and found them responsible for more than US $ 210 billion in sales last year alone.\nCollege students have learned how to spend their money, with 93 percent saying low prices were important when shopping.\nThe study also showed that 65 percent make loan payments; 41 percent of freshmen have a credit card; and 79 percent of seniors have a credit card. A significant number of charges on these credit cards are likely to be for entertainment and leisure expenses.",
