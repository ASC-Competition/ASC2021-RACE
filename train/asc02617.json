A similar percentage admit that they search online for evidence of their spouse's _ , while nearly one in five say they have daily quarrels because of the way their husband or wife uses social media. The research was assigned by law firm Gordon in response to an increase in the number of its clients who said that Facebook, Skype, Snapchat, Twitter or other social media sites had played a part in their divorce.\nAndrew Newbury, of law firm Gordon, said: 'Social media is the new marriage.

The survey by Censuswide among 2011 husbands and wives, found the most common reasons for checking their spouse's social media accounts were to discover who they were talking to, who they were meeting and where they were going. A quarter of the married people said the resulting suspicions led to quarrels at least once a week, and 17 percent said such quarrels were daily events.\nArguments were caused by contact with former partners, by the sending of secret messages, and by the posting of 'inappropriate' pictures. Some 14 percent said they looked at their spouse's social media with the specific intention of detecting evidence of adultery .",
