  "article": "A visit to a museum contributes to our education. The British Museum is a great building in our London, not far from London University. Thousands of visitors go to it every year to see the rare, strange and beautiful things it contains. What interests many people more than anything else is the large library, in which there are millions of books. You can find any English book you want there, and many books in foreign languages or translated into English. The library is also a reading room, with tables and chairs for students who wish to study; but if you want to borrow books to read there you must first get a reader's ticket from the office. One can't borrow books to take away.\nIn other parts of the museum there are rooms and halls containing things which have been brought from countries all over the world. They help us to understand the history of foreign lands, and the people who live in them. Some of the things which have been dug up in places where old cities once stood were being worn out or used by men and women thousands of years ago. These cities now lie buried, covered with many feet of earth.\nOn the way out you can buy pictures of the most interesting things that are shown in the museum.",
