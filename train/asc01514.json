  "article": "It was almost four o'clock in the morning when the fire broke out.\"We watch one window blow out,and then another,and heard people shouting,\"says Stanley,21,a junior from Westfield State College in Massachusetts.Students were throwing ropes made from bed sheets out their windows,and a couple of them were trying to climb down.\nAlmost all the hotel's 502 rooms were filled with college students from across the United States who were spending their holiday here in Acpulco,Mexico.As the smoke thickened,Moreno ran upstairs to where other Westfield students were rooming.\"Some people had no idea what was going on,\"he says.\"I was shouting at the top of my voice.I made sure I hit every door.\"At the same time,Stanley was downstairs helping people get through the smokefilled hall.There he joined forces with Nalewanski who had just come back from his own night out.\n\"Let's go.\"Nalewanski says.He and Stanley wet their shirts in the bathroom and wrapped them around their mouths and noses so they could breathe.Then they ran up the stairs.\nNalewanski and Stanley found Moreno on the fourth floor.They all ran upstairs and down the corridors  on every floor,hitting every door hard.\nIn the end,no one was seriously injured.Even more unbelievable,all the Westfield students made it back to Massachusetts later that same day.\nWestfield president Evan Dobelle says,\"I have a great deal of pride in these young men and they were able to react in such an emergency.\"",
