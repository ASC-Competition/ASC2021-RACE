Here, they receive a suit, shoes and any other things they need, Since it was set up, more than 1,000 women have turned to \"Dress for Success\" for help. Many of them have won job.

Jenny, a 32-year-old woman who was recently hired as a law-firm office manager says, \"I made a good impression because of 'Dress for Success'.\"",
