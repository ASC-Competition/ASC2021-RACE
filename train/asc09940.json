  "article": "Mr. King was over sixty and lived by himself a long way from town. He nearly hadn't left his home. But one day he went into town to buy things. After he bought them, he went into a restaurant and sat down at a table by himself. When he looked around, he saw several old people put glasses on before they read their newspapers. So after lunch he decided to go to a shop to buy himself a pair of glasses, too. He walked along the street and soon found a shop.\nThe man in the shop helped him try on many pairs of glasses, but Mr. King always said, \"No, I cannot read with them.\"\nThe man became more and more puzzled and in the end ha said, \"Excuse me, but can you read?\"\n\"No, of course not!\" Mr. King said angrily. \"If I can read, why have I come here?\"",
