  "article": "Parts of Africa are covered by a dark cloud. But this is no rain cloud. It is a living cloud made of billions of locusts   and they are eating everything in their path.\nAnd now in order to fight against this disaster, a radio station in Senegal, West Africa, is offering listeners 5 kilograms of rice if they can catch and kill 50 kilograms of locusts. \"We think this idea will get more people to take part in the fight against the locusts,\" said Abdoulaye Ba, from Sud-Fm, a radio station in one of Senegal's worst affected area.\nThis is West Africa's biggest locust disaster in 15 years. Now it is moving east and it leads to the loss of crops. When they move, they have babies, so their number is getting bigger. and will soon threaten   Sudan in the northeast of Africa. Some say it may reach Asia.\nExperts say many people in the areas will go hungry because of this disaster. What's worse, governments in the areas don't have enough things to fight the locusts.\nAlthough leaders of 12 countries have agreed on a plan, it is not enough. 'We are now treating 6,000 hectares   per day with pesticide  , but we need to treat 20,000 hectares per day in order to have any hope of controlling this disaster,' said Mohamed Abdallahi Ould Babah, leader of locust control  in Mauritania.",
