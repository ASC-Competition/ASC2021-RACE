  "article": "BEIJING -- China's education authority will tighten the widely criticized policy of \"extra credits\" for the national college entrance examination to ensure a fairer chance for all exam-takers.\nUnder the policy, high school students who win awards in national Olympic competitionscould get ''extra credits', up to 20 points for the national college entrance exam. Students with talentin sports and students who are from ethnic groups can also benefit from this policy. The extra creditshave increased these students' chances of being admitted by famous universities. Some parents werefound to have helped their children fabricate award experiences or falsify qualifications to getextra credits.\n\"It has harmed education equality,\" the ministry said.\nXiong Bingqi, vice-chief of the 21st Century Education Research Institute, said the policy isdesigned to help students who have special talents but may be weak in academic performance tohave a chance to receive higher education. It will still be needed but it is time to make the rulesfairer,\" he said.\nThe ministry said it will reduce the range of competitions whose winners can get extra credits,and limit the winners, privileges.\nThe new policy will apply to students who begin high school in 2011, it said.\nChen Lei, a mother of a 10-year-old girl, said she welcomed the ministry's policy adjustmentas she does not want her daughter to become an Olympic competition _ .\nBut not all the Chinese parents welcomed the new policy. \"It is like a thunderbolt for me. My 13-year-old son has spent so much time studying Olympic math, and participated in so manytechnological competitions during vacations. It is useless now,\" said Dong Wen, a 43-year-oldmother.\nA student said, \"Many students have changed the current study plan, and they can abandon thecompetition. I will be interested in learning the courses which can improve my abilities.\"\nYuan Guiren, minister of education, told China Daily that the reform is an attempt to consider the overall quality of an applicant. \"But the country will not stop the national college entrance  examination as it is still the most objective way to evaluate talent in China,\" he said.",
