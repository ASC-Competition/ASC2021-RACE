  "article": "One evening Tim is driving his car in the country and looking for a hotel. Then he sees an old man on the side of the road, so he stops his car and says to the old man, \"Where is Sun Hotel? Will you please tell me how to get there?\" \"Yes,\" the old man answers. \"I'll show you the way.\" He gets into Tim's car, and they drive for about 12 kilometres. When they come to a small house, the old man says, \"Stop here.\" Tim stops and looks at the house. And he says to the old man, \"But this isn't a hotel.\" \"No,\" the old man answers. \"This is my house. And now I'll show you the way to Sun Hotel. Turn back and go 9 kilometres. Then you'll see the hotel on your left. \"",
