The Diski dance, which is performed through heading and kicking an imaginary ball, may be a goal celebration to watch in the following matches.\nSouth Africa's Siphiwe Tshabalala and his teammates performed this different dance when they celebrated his goal against Mexico in the opening World Cup game on Friday. The dance is already popular on YouTube and many soccer fans may want to learn the moves.\nEven South Africa's President Jacob Zuma has learnt the Diski dance which could be better than Cameroon Roger Milla's corner flag dance celebration in the 1990 FIFA World Cup. US actor John Travolta performed the dance shortly after landing his Boeing 707 at Lanseria airport, north of Johannesburg, on Wednesday morning.\nGoal celebrations are now part of the biggest sporting event and players plan them in advance just in case they find the back of the net. In football, a goal celebration is the practice of celebrating the scoring of a goal. The celebration may be performed by the goal-scorer, his or her teammates, the manager or coaches and the supporters of the team.\nThe Robot goal celebration was so popular that England fans were surprised when Crouch, an English international footballer, said that he wouldn't be doing it any more unless England won the World Cup.\nThe word Diski is the word used by the local people for soccer and may also describe the local style of football which focuses on dribbling  and other tricks.",
