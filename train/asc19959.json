  "article": "I go to Australia for a meeting with my workmate, Chris. We decide  to drive across the country after the meeting. The drive will take four days and most of it was across the desert .\nThe first day is a lot of fun because we are happy to hear each other's jokes . But on the third day, we begin to get _ . We are quite quiet for some hours when  Chris sees some kangaroos .We are both excited and decide to take a closer  look. Chris drives very quickly to catch up with them. We got closer and closer. Suddenly , we hear a loud BANG!\nChris stops the car and we get out. Beside the car is a large kangaroo  lying on the ground. Chris goes over to it and puts his cap on its head. He takes off his sunglasses and puts them on the kangaroo and does the same with his jacket. Then he puts his arm around the kangaroo and tells me to take a photo of them together. I take out my camera. When I am focusing the camera, I sees the kangaroo move . It suddenly wakes up, and runs away before we can do anything.\nI start laughing  but Chris looks worried. He says his wallet is in the jacket. I start laughing even louder . I stop laughing when he says that our car keys are also in the jacket.",
