  "article": "Disney has adapted a series of beloved animated films into its live-action  movies, and that trend has not even begun to slow.\nOn Monday, the company announced that the newest movie to get the live-action treatment would be Mulan.\nBased on the same Chinese legend as the 1998 animated movie, Mulan will follow in the footsteps of Cinderella, Maleficent, and several already-announced upcoming movies.\nSince 2010, Disney has released three live-action adaptations of formerly animated movies: Alice In Wonderland, Maleficent, and Cinderella.\nAll three have proven to be financial successes, with Alice In Wonderland earning over $1 billion and Maleficent bringing in $758 million.\nEven the most recent offering, Cinderella, has managed to earn over $330 million in its first three weeks of wide release.\nFans of live-action remakes will not have to wait for Mulan, since Disney has already planned four other adaptations to hit theatres first.\nThe Jungle Book is the next movie to get a live-action revival, planned for 2016. \nA retelling of Beauty And The Beast - starring Emma Watson, Dan Stevens, and Audra McDonald - will begin production in May, with an expected release date of March 17, 2017.\nSurprisingly, the other Disney cartoon getting an adaptation is 1941's Dumbo, the story of a flying elephant.\nTim Burton signed on to direct that tricky movie on March 10.",
