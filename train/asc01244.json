  "article": "Everyone agrees that all the creatures want happiness and are afraid of pain and grief. The question, however, is \"What is real happiness?\" The desire for happiness has no meaning without understanding the real nature of happiness.\nGenerally, ordinary beings consider sensual  pleasures as happiness, and their actions are directed toward gaining these. According to them, searching for happiness means searching for pleasures of the senses. The question, \"What is happiness?\", does not arise  in their hearts, because in their hearts they think of a life full of sensual joys as a happy life.\nSome thinkers say, \"Happiness does not lie in the objects of enjoyment; happiness or unhappiness lies in the imagination.\" To prove their belief they give examples like the following one. A man has a two-storey house. When he thinks of those who have a house with three storeys or more, he feels unhappy. When he thinks of those who have just a _ , he feels happy. Such happiness does not lie in possessions , but in the imagination. They advise people to take inspiration from those who have few possessions but are quite happy. If you only consider people wealthier than yourself, you will always be unhappy.\nIf you want to be happy, they say, look at the poor. But it is unreasonable to hold that happiness lies in the imagination. And it is inappropriate to think that someone is happy if he only imagines himself better than the poor and the unhappy. This attitude also satisfies the sense of pride of possession. This can never be called happiness. Unless we find out where happiness lies, we cannot really become happy.\nSome ask people to do this or that, and say, \"This way your desires will be satisfied. That way you will get what you want and become happy.\" People holding these views regard happiness as satisfaction of desires and unhappiness as denial  of such satisfaction.",
