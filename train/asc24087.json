It is about 247.5 kilometers in all.\nThe Line 1(1) started construction  in June, 2009 and people could take the first half of Line 1 in May,2014. It is between Gaoqiao and Ningbo East New Town. And the second half opened in 2015. There are also other five lines to connect   Haishu, Jiangdong, Jiangbei, Beilun and Yinzhou after Line1.\nThe logo of Ningbo Rail Transit is a dynamic  \"Yong\". It is another name for Ningbo.\nIt says the traffic in Ningbo is active and fast. And the color of the logo is blue because Ningbo is a sea city.\nOn the wall of six rail transit stops, there are a lot of beautiful pictures.\nThey are about Ningbo culture. For example, at the Ximenkou Stop, it paints Tianyige Museum and many books. And it draws Moon Lake on the wall of Drum-tower Stop. All these pictures tell people the history of Ningbo.",
