  "article": "When the plane was waiting at the airport,a big snake climbed up the steps and into the plane. It went to sleep under the pilot's  seat. Nobody noticed. Soon the passengers  get on the plane and it took off. A little girl called Mary took out a whistle  and began playing. But none of the passengers liked the music. They got the stewardess to ask the girl to stop.\nThe sound of the plane's engines  woke up the snake. It put its head out and looked around the captain's  room. When the captain saw the snake, he was so frightened that he could hardly breath. He was so afraid that he could not control  the plane. The plane began to swing from side to side. The stewardess told the passengers what was happening and ask them to calm down. Mary was not afraid. She ran to the captain's room with her whistle and began to play the slow tune . At once the snake followed her. The girl returned to her seat and the snake lay on the floor beside her. Dancing to the music.\nWhen the plane landed the airport the snake was taken in a net to a zoo near Mary's house. She often went to visit the snake.",
