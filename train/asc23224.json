  "article": "I' m Eric. Welcome to our classroom. You can see a nice classroom. A blackboard  is on the wall. A map of China and a map of the world are on the wall, too. The map of China is old. But the map of the world is new. There is a teacher's desk. An eraser and a ruler are on it.\nThere are two doors in the wall. Some brooms  and a football are behind the door. Fifty desks and chairs are in our classroom. They are our desks and chairs. That is a bookcase. And some books are in it. The students can read them after class but can't _ any of them out.\nSome flowers are near the window. They are red. We like our classroom. We like our class, too.",
