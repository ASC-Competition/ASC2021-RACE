  "article": "People have strange ideas about food. In the 18th century, Americans never ate tomatoes. They grew them in their gardens because tomato plants are so pretty. But they thought the vegetable was poisonous . They called tomatoes \"poison apples.\"\nPresident Thomas Jefferson, however, knew that tomatoes were good to eat. He was a learned man. He had been to Paris, where he learned to love the taste of tomatoes. He grew many kinds of tomatoes in his garden. The President taught his cook a way, for a cream of tomato soup . This beautiful pink soup was served at the President's next dinner party. The guests thought the soup tasted really good. They never thought their President would sever his dinner guests poison apples. Jefferson never spoke to his guests about the fact.",
