  "article": "Six days before the 63rd birthday of New China, our country received a great gift. The country's first aircraft carrier  , Liaoning, has made China become the l0th country in the world to have an aircraft camer.\nAn aircraft carrier is a kind of ship that planes can fly from and land on--like an airport on the sea. It stands for a country's military strength . It plays an important role in modern wars.\nIn August last year, the air craft carrier began its trial run at Dalian Port in Liaoning. The carrier was at first called the Varyag. It was built in the former Soviet Union. However, the Soviets failed to finish the ship. China bought the Varyag in 1998. Now after 10 trial runs, the aircraft carrier, renamed Liaoning, is in active service.\nLiaoning is about 300 meters long and 70 meters wide. It can take 30 planes and hold 2,000 soldiers.\nAccording to Xinhua News, Liaoning will be used for scientific research and military training.\nThe aircraft carrier will help protect our country and promote  world peace. The BBC said that Liaoning coming into service \" marks China as a rising power\".\n,.",
