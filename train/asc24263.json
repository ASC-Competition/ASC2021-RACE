  "article": "Now, I'm studying in the US. I find there are some differences between schools in the US and in Vietnam.\nOne big difference is the clothes students wear at school and how they look. In my country, all the students should wear uniforms when they go to school. Boys aren't allowed to have long hair. Girls aren't allowed to have long or colored nails .\nAnother difference is about the rules for parents. In Vietnam, when we begin a new school year, our parents have to go to a meeting in our class. If they don't go to that meeting, their children won't have a grade or a report card from school. However, in the US, there aren't such strict rules above.\nIn Vietnam, a class is only 45 minutes and we have only five classes each weekday. When the bell rings, the students just sit in their own classroom. They can't move to a different one, but students can in the US.\nIn Vietnam, students can't go to work because they can't find a job if they're under18. But in the US, many students work after school. This helps them make money. More importantly, this helps them become more _ . They're able to do things by themselves in their own way, without asking other people for help.",
