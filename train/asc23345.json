  "article": "Something bad happened to sam this morning. He fell over and broke his nose in the school hallway. When Sam looked up, he saw his friends. \"Are you OK?\" They asked him. But he didn't say anything to them. He stood up and ran to the classroom quickly. Sam put his schoolbag on his desk and went out to the school hospital. On his way back to the classroom he saw his friends again. They were laughing. Sam thought they were laughing at him, so he didn't talk to them for the rest of the morning.\nAt lunchtime, Sam's friends came up to him and asked, \"How is your nose?\" \"Fine!\" Sam shouted. \"I saw you laughing at me this morning!\" \"We didn't. We laughed just because Jenny told us a joke,\" his friends said. \"Well, I'm sorry. Can you _ me?\" \"Yes, of course. But next time you should ask us before you assume something.\" They looked at each other and laughed happily. They were still friends.\n,,.",
