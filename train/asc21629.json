  "article": "Have you ever heard of the group Westlife? Maybe you have, but I'm sure many of you don't know very much about it.\nWestlife is an Irish boy band group, which was made up of 6 boys in the beginning and called IOU. The group quickly became popular with young people thanks to their song Swear It Again, which was at the top of the UK charts   in April 1999.\nChinese fans got their first chance to see Westlife on March 6th, 2006 in Beijing. Although the four-member group has been singing pop for seven years, the young boys have all since grown up and their songs are still very popular. When they performed in Beijing, Westlife released   their new album Face to Face in China. Face to Face has been at the top of the British charts for a long time. The album's most popular song You Raise Me Up mixes traditional Irish music with pop music.\nAlthough hip-hop is quite popular among the young, Westlife has no plans to change. They said, \"Hip-hop is for the young, but pop can be enjoyed by moms who are busy cooking meals and raising the kids.",
