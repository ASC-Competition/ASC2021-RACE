  "article": "Different countries and different people have different manners. We must find out their customs, so that they will not think us ill-mannered. Here are some examples of the things that a well-mannered  person does or does not do.\nIf you visit a Chinese family you should knock at the door first. When the door opens, you'll not move before the host says \"Come in, please.\" After you enter the room, you wouldn't sit down until the host asks you to take a seat. When a cup of tea is put on a tea-table before you or sent to your hand, you'll say \"Thank you\" and receive it with your two hands, not one hand, or they'll think you are ill-mannered.\n Before entering a house in Japan, it is good manners to take off your shoes.In European countries, even though shoes sometimes become very dirty, this is not done.In a Malay house, a guest never finishes the food on the table. He leaves a little to show that he has had enough. In England, a guest always finishes a drink or the food to show that he has enjoyed it. This will make the host, especially the hostess pleased.",
