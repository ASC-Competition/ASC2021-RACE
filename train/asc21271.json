  "article": "Once there was something wrong with a machine in a factory. The workers could do nothing but turn to a German engineer for help, who drew a line on it and then said, \"Take off the part where the line is and change it for a new one. \"The machine, with a new line on, began running well again. The engineer then asked for $30,000 for what he had done. The following were what he wrote on a bill, \"The new part only costs one dollar, and knowing where the problem with the machine is costs $29,999.\"\nOne dollar for changing a new part sounds reasonable  but the $29,999 is exactly the value  of wisdom  and knowledge.",
