  "article": "Tone of voice is very important in human conversation. A person might use words that communicate one message and a tone that shows something very different. This possibility for confusion is one reason that businessmen encourage discussing things in person, rather than through email, as tone cannot be determined in the written form.\nThe same rule is true with children. Children as young as a few months respond to a change in voice. It has been recorded that babies prefer to hear a story read by their own mother rather than another woman whom they do not know.\nHave you ever talked to someone who had little or no changes in their voice no matter what you were discussing? Think of the teacher or professor you had in the past that spoke in a _ manner for the entirelecture. It is very boring and difficult to become interested in the topic.\nParents should make an active effort to communicate with your child. If your child figures out how to open a box he or she has been struggling with and says \"YES!\" with pride in his or her voice, your response should be happy and excited (something encouraging, like \"You did it!\"). If you plainly said the same thing, you would not be matching the tone of your child.\nThis applies to feelings that the child may express in everyday situations as well. If a child argues with a friend, your response should not be said in a high voice or with a smile. Seriously and sincerely you should say \"You look sad\" or \"That must have been hard for you\".\nThe tone of your voice expresses understanding, acknowledgement, connection and several other healthy things to your child. Although your words are very important, equally important is the tone with which you say those words.",
