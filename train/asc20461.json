  "article": "In China, people usually set off firecrackers to celebrate Spring Festival. But this year seemed very quiet. It was really different. A man called Zhang Wei was asked by a reporter in an interview. He said that his friends and he hadn't set off a single firecracker.\n\"We all suffered from last month's smog . If we don't call an end to the firecracker, the environment will get worse and worse during the holiday.\" said Zhang Wei. He put up a notice in his community in Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province. In the notice, he called on more people to set off fewer firecrackers during this year's Spring Festival holiday.\nLots of parents agreed with Zhang Wei's idea. They said that they hated the noise of firecrackers. The noise used to wake up their babies too early. The babies really needed quiet mornings,\nMore Chinese looked forward to celebrating the holiday in a greener way. They decided not to set off firecrackers. They also decided not to waste food. They said that the new celebrations sounded fashionable.\n\"My family didn't buy any fireworks this year. Instead, we donated the money to charity. It's good for the environment and charity as well.\" Internet user \"Fighter\" wrote on Sina Weibo.\n,A, B, C, D,. (10)",
