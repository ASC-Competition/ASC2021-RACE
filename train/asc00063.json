  "article": "I was never neat, while my roommate Kate was extremely organized. Each of her projects had its place, but mine always hid somewhere. She even labeled everything. I always looked for everything. Over time, Kate got neater and I got messier. She would push my dirty clothing over, and I would lay my books on her tidy desk. We both get tired of each other.\nWar broke out one evening. Kate came into the room. Soon, I heard her screaming, \" take your shoes away! Why under my bed!\" Deafened, I saw my shoes flying at me. I jumped to my feet and started yelling. She yelled back louder.\nThe room was filled with anger. We could not have stayed together for a single minute but for a phone call. Kate answered it. From her end of the conversation, I could tell right away her grandma was seriously ill. When she hung up, she quickly crawled under her covers, sobbing. Obviously, that was something she should not go through alone. All of a sudden, a warm feeling of sympathy rose up in my heart.\nSlowly, I collected the pencils, took back the books, made my bed, cleaned the socks and swept the floor, even on her side. I got so into my work that I even didn't notice Kate had sat up. She was watching, her tears dried and her expression one of disbelief. Then, she reached out her hands to grasp mine. I looked up into her eyes. She smiled at me, \"thanks.\"\nKate and I stayed roommates for the rest of the year. We didn't always agree, but we learned the key to living together; giving in, cleaning up and holding on.",
