  "article": "Traffic lights are very important for us. I think you know this. But do you know how they were born?\nGarrett A. Morgan was the father of traffic lights. He was an American. His family was very poor. He left school at the age of 14. He was clever. He always looked for better ways to do things. And he liked to make new things.\nAt that time, every American wanted to have a car. The streets were full of cars. The traffic was really bad. \"Why not put three lights at each corner ? They should be red,green,and yellow,\" Morgan said , \" Let them tell cars to go or stop.\" He made a timer  to change the lights.\nSo we have traffic lights today .",
