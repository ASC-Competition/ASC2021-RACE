  "article": "Kids love the all-knowing Google. Your kids likely use Google to help them find everything from information for homework assignments, to funny cat videos, and everything in between. Sometimes kids can take a \"wrong turn\" on Google and end up in a dark part of the Internet where they shouldn't be. Thankfully, Google has some parental control features that parents can implement to at least help reduce the volume  of crap  that ends up in search results,which can enable you to help keep your curious kids from ending up on the wrong side of the tracks.\nWhat is Google SafeSearch? Google SafeSearch is one of the primary parental control options offered by Google to help parents police search results. SafeSearch helps to filter explicit content out of search results. It is mainly designed to target sexually explicit material (images and videos) and not violent content.\nHow to Enable Google SafeSearch?1. From the \"Search Settings\" preferences page, place a check in the box with the label \"Filter explicit results\". 2. To lock this setting so that your child can't change it, click the \"Lock SafeSearch\" link. If you are not already logged into your Google account, you will need to do so in order to lock SafeSearch to the \"on\" position.\nEnable SafeSearch on Mobile Devices. In addition to your computer, you will probably also want to enable SafeSearch on any mobile device that your child uses regularly. For instructions on how to enable SafeSearch on a variety of mobile devices, check out Google's SafeSearch Mobile support page.  As we all know, kids are going to be kids and try to test their boundaries. We put up one roadblock and they go around it. It's a constant cat and mouse game and there will always be some internet door that we as parents forget to lock, and that will be the one that the kids get through, but we do the best we can.",
