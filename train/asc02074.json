  "article": "There were two interesting pieces of news items in the paper a few years ago. One was about a man who received a bill from the telephone company for $ 2,000 a month for doing nothing.\nThe connection between the two news items is simple; computers-the best invention of the 20th century. The telephone bill came from a computer which made a terrifying mistake; that man's bill was only $ 23.26. The other item was not as amusing. A man walked into the unguarded computer room of a large packaged food company and expertly programmed the computer to pay him $ 2,000 a month for raw meat which he \"supplied \" to the company. Of course he never sent the meat, but he certainly received the money . The computer wrote out a bill, and even \"signed \" it. It was only a random   check that uncovered the trick. It could be happening in thousands of other companies all over the world.\nComputers are not the magical workers that some people say they are. They make mistakes, they're sometimes slower than human beings and they're easily fooled.\nThe US used to conscript   people with the help of a computer. The army sent out a card, which had to be filled in and sent back. It was easy to avoid being called up simply by spreading candle-wax  on the card. The computer couldn't read the card, and did nothing with it.\nIt's in our everyday life that computers cause many problems. Let's get back to using people instead of computers, before a mistake that we can't put right.",
