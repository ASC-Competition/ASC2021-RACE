  "article": "\"Now stretch  over your right leg!\" my dance teacher yells over the music. \"If it doesn't hurt, you're not trying hard enough. Hold that stretch for 30 seconds!\" My dance teacher works hard to form us into the dancers we desire to be. In order for this to occur, we stretch hard a lot!\nDancing is a real passion of many people, including me. I work hard to make myself better, and prove that I am good enough. Performing a dance routine is more than just a  performance. Dancers tell stories when they dance. It is a way for us to express our personal feelings. Just letting go and letting your body move with the music can create your emotions. Dance tells us things that our mind secretly hides.\n\"Get up and do it again!  You need to keep your spirits up!\" Even though I am completely worn out after my dances, I love to hear those words. It gives me a sense of relief knowing that I can again express my feelings out on the floor.\n\"Practice makes perfect! Come on. We have a competition this weekend, and we need to work harder!\" Competitions are the best possible example of fun. For a dancer, life cannot get better than competitions. The thrill of losing yourself onstage is a rush of energy rushing through your body! The feeling is unexplainable. As you sit there putting on your makeup, fixing your hair, and putting on your costume, the rush just gradually grows until it is ready to be released onstage.\nFinally the time comes to tell your story. Standing backstage waiting for your name to be called is one of the scariest moments. You are ready to show the world what you are capable of and what you have been perfecting for a while. Once your number is called, you walk out onstage. The applause at the end tells each dancer that their story has been received, and that the dance has been brought to life.",
