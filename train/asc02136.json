  "article": "Early to bed, Early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\nThis is an old English saying. Have you heard it before? It means that we must go to bed early and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy. We shall also be rich(wealthy) and clever(wise).\nIs this true? Perhaps it is. the body must have enough sleep. Children need ten hours' sleep every night. If you do not go to bed early, you cannot have enough sleep. Then you cannot think properly  and you cannot do your work properly. You will not be wise and you may not become wealthy!\nSome people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is not good for them. We must sleep at night when it is dark. The dark helps us to sleep properly. When the daylight comes, we must get up. This is the time for exercise. Exercise means doing things with the body. Walking, running, jumping, swimming, and playing games are all exercise. If the body is not used, it becomes weak. Exercise keeps it strong. Exercise helps the blood to move ,brains  in our heads also need blood. We think with our brains. If we keep our bodies healthy, and take exercise, we can think better.\nOur bodies also need air to breathe. Without air we die. We must have a lot of clean, fresh  air to breathe if we want to be healthy.",
