  "article": "It was a cold and wet night. Over the radio came the message to deal with an accident in one of the side streets of the city. The scene of the accident wasn't far away and we arrived after 10 minutes. Two cars had crashed. Two women were lying on the street and one driver was still in the car. The driver was quite drunk  and kept shouting to us. He didn't get badly hurt. A young woman died at once when the two cars crashed. I was holding the other woman and tried to stop the bleeding, but at last I had to watch her die in my arms.\nThree months later, I saw the driver in court and found him to be a normal person. He was sorry for his actions. In the end, he was put into the prison for several years. A man isn't a man if he drinks 10 beers in an hour. A man is a man when he knows his limit and takes responsibility . When he can stay away from wine, he can drive more safely.",
