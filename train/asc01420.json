  "article": "It was a weeknight. We were a half dozen guys in our late teens, hanging around \"the flat\" -- as usual. The flat was poorly furnished, which, after some time, grew tiresome. We wanted action.\nWe got in a car, big enough for all of us to crowd into -- and off we went, in search of adventure. We soon found ourselves at Blue Gum Corner, a place named after the huge old blue gum tree that stood by there, a well-known local landmark. It stands at a minor crossroad leading to our town. The trunk is tall and smooth with no handholds for climbing. About six metres from the ground the first branch sticks out over the road. We parked beneath the huge old tree and discussed what we might do. All of a sudden we hit upon an idea -- a hanging! I was chosen as \"hangee\".\nThe plan was quite simple. As I stood upon the roof of the car, the rope   was threaded down my jacket through my collar and down one leg of my jeans. I put my foot through the loop at the bottom. There I hung, still. The boys rolled about laughing until, a car, I hear a car! Before they ran to hide in the nearby field, they gave me a good push so that \"the body\" would swing as the car drove by.\nTo our disappointment, the car simply turned off for town without even slowing. The boys came out of their hiding places and we discussed the situation. Surely they had seen me, hadn't they? Then we heard another car. The act was repeated, but still without any obvious reaction. We played the game about five or six times, but as no one seemed to notice, we abandoned the trick.\nWhat we did not know was that every car that had passed had unquestionably seen \"the body\" and each one, too scared to stop, had driven directly to the local Police Station. Now at that time of the night, the local policeman was sound asleep in his bed, so the first person sent to the scene was the traffic officer that happened to be on duty that particular night. He had been informed that some person had been killed, by hanging, at Blue Gum Corner. When he arrived, the body was gone! And he was hearing \"unnatural sounds\" from the surrounding area. As far as he knew, some fierce animal was hiding in the field before him, possibly dragging a body behind him -- and we thought we were scared!\nHe went to his radio and made a call that really began to worry us. I lay so close that I could hear every word. He called for the \"armed police\" and a \"dog team, better make it two\" and he had a \"serious situation\" at Blue Gum Corner. Then the police officer arrived. After a briefing from the traffic officer he decided not to go into the field until armed police and dog teams arrived. Now two spotlights were on the field and none of us could move.\nAs luck would have it, police cars cannot leave their spotlights on all night without charging their batteries. So, after a time, the two officers began lightening the field by turns, allowing us the opportunity to move on our fours for freedom. One by one, we all managed to steal away and make our way home. Behind us we left what must have looked like a small city of lights, police cars, roadblocks, barking dogs, armed officers and an old rope hanging from a tree.\nWhen I think back to that night, to that tree, to what the drivers of the cars think happened, to what police believe happened, and to what I know happened, I am reminded of a simple truth -- our eyes see darkness and light, color and movement, our ears hear only vibrations   in the air. It is how we explain these vivid pictures that shapes our \"reality\".",
