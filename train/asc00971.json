  "article": "My darling daughter,\nRecently I saw a diary of years. It was written when you were nine. I read your goals in the diary, and one little goal was really surprising for me. It was \"to make Mom happy\".\nI was so moved, and I would have told you that you made me happy every day of my life.  My first thoughts in the morning were of you. When I got home from work, I couldn't wait to see you. I liked talking to you very much and I wanted to know what your day was like. You kept my spirit alive, my mind challenged and my body active. You were, and still are, the light of my life. Without you, my life would have been boring. You made me happy and you continue to do so.\nYou are a mother now, with a child of your own. I know you love her, so I think you should tell her how happy she makes you. Sometimes we forget to say the words that are in our hearts. These words can be very important to a child. They can change their world completely. They can create a beautiful world for them.\nYou are my joy in life, my little one. You always have been, and you always will be. Never forget that, and tell that to your child. Tell her that she is the most important thing in the world for you, because she makes things joyful in your life! I love you, my dearest daughter.\nMom",
