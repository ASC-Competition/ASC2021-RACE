  "article": "Finding something to do during the school holidays isn't always easy, but one mum has set up a new website to help families find activities and events in Norfolk.\nFiona Anthony of Bawburgh, near Norwich, was persuaded by her friends to set up the website, Info4Families, when they noticed she always knew what events were happening in the county .\n\"I am always looking for things to keep my children _ and Norfolk has such a lot going on,\" she said.\nDetail from Info4Families\n\"But I found it quite difficult to get information about events and activities for children and families, as there was no central information point and it would often involve collecting leaflets  and checking notice boards at different places.\n\"So I decided to set up a website which would allow people to find things to do, without leaving home,\" she added.\nFiona was also concerned that some events she had booked had to be cancelled  because not enough people wanted to go.\n\"It is a real shame that some parents can't find the events and some event organisers don't get the numbers they need. I want to help bring the two together,\" said Fiona.\nThe website gives details on regular, one-off and free events, and includes activities which children can do on their own or with the family.\nParents can look for activities by category and by age so that they can find events suitable for their children's interests and needs. The site also links to local places of interest, such as libraries, museums and cinemas.",
