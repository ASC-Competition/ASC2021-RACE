  "article": "Greg Evans started to study film at Ryerson University, but had a change of heart and switched to social work at George Brown College in second year.Yet the college recognized only one of Evans' general-interest credits  from Ryerson , and also made him take English all over again although he had passed it at university.\n\"So I spent time and money taking a course I had already taken before\", complained Evans.\"The system really needs to change.\" Evans was part of a chorus of Ontario students on Monday cheering a new $ 73.7 million five-year plan to help students switch from college to university, and from university to college.\nAfter years' of urging from students, the Ontario government set up a new Credit Transfer Innovation loud to help students move back and forth between the more hands-on courses of community college to the often broader academic focus of a university degree.\" We hear horror stories about students who can't get recognition from one institution for a very similar course at another, and in one case I believe the same professor was teaching them both,\" noted Malloy after announcing the new fund.\nIndividual colleges and universities have decided on nearly 500 joint deals to honor each other's credits in certain courses.Each school is required to set targets for more credit-transfer agreements, and link these increases to provincial funding.\nMore than 4,000 college graduates transfer   to university in Ontario every year twice as many as eight years ago, noted Justin Fox, president of the College Student Alliance.Yet Ontario universities and colleges have been cautious about transferring credits, in part to avoid copying each other's courses, noted Bonnie Patterson, president of the Council of Ontario Universities ,who welcomed the increased flexibility.",
