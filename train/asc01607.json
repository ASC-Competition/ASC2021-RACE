  "article": "You may have experienced the frustration of receiving a parking fine or finding your car towed away  after leaving it parked for a couple of minutes.\nBut now a high tech car sticker could help motorists avoid such a situation by allowing a traffic warden to get in touch with them.Car owners can buy the sticker and place it inside their car's windscreen,having set it up with vital information,such as their phone number.The slim design will i nclude a sensor that will send a text message warning a driver about a coming fine when touched by a traffic warden.The message will ask them to move their car immediately.The driver could then type a reply for the warden us ing their smartphone,which will appear on the sticker's screen.They may choose to write something along the lines of\"back in two minutes\"in a bid to avoid a fine.Frankfurt-based IT consultant,Daniel Kalliontzis,came up with the idea and is raising funds on Indiegogo to put his 54 sticker into production.\nThe smart sticker system will rely on the good will of traffic wardens and critically,a German law.The law states:\"An officer has to choose the most e fficient and inexpensive way for the car owner to remove the vehicle.\"It could be cheaper for the authorities to contact the driver than to tow his car.\nAt the time of writing,Mr Kalliontzis has raised just over 3,000 of his 50,000 goal on Indiegogo.If he manages to raise the money,the stickers will be shipped in June 2015.But it appears that car owners using the smart system could get some unnecessary warning messages,because anyone could touch the smart sticker.",
