  "article": "It was late, around 10 p.m. A young lady, named Thea, was waiting at the train station. She was waiting for the last train to arrive, when she heard her phone ring. It was her brother. The line was suddenly cut off when she answered, and the phone did not ring again. The lady waited for a call back, but her phone did not ring. She sat on the bench, holding her phone.\nShe was definitely uneasy. Her mother was very ill and was in hospital. She was looking around, looking for a phone loading station, but since it was already late, the stalls were already closed. She had no choice but to wait till the train came and wait till she got home.\nA young lady in her late 20s approached her. She was very sincere. She asked what was wrong. Thea looked at the stranger's eyes and said \"nothing\". But the other lady was just so sincere and wanted to help.\n   She took out her cell phone from her shoulder bag and handed it to Thea. The helpful lady said, \"Here's my phone; it has extra loads; you can make a call.\"\n\"Is it OK? \" asked Thea. \"Yeah,\" she said, looking directly into her eyes. Then Thea, in a very shy manner, slowly dialed a number and talked with someone on the phone. A smile was on her face. \"Thank you so much; you took my worries away.\" \"You are welcome; I am glad that I can give you a hand. \"\nIn fact, kindness can be shared at any time in any place.",
