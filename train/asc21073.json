I know it's helpful to learn English well. After school I often go to the school library to read English stories or articles. Sometimes my English teacher tells some interesting things to me. I collect information for my diary by doing these.\nAfter I finish my diary every day. I always try to correct mistakes with the help of the dictionary. Now my English is very good.\nI love my hobby. It helps me a lot to learn English well.",
