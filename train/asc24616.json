It was most popular during the Tang Dynasty. China has many kinds of tea. White, yellow, green, oolong  , black and dark tea are the six main kinds.\nPeople in different places drink tea in their own way. People in Guangdong and Fujian love to drink \"Kung Fu Tea\" in small tea cups. They clean the teapot   first with boiling water to warm it up. Then they fill the teapot with tea leaves before putting in the boiling water.\nIn Beijing, people love jasmine flower green tea. In Tibet, butter tea   is a popular drink to build up energy.\nThere are rules to follow when we serve tea to others. Most importantly, remember to make the cup only seven-tenths full. If the cup is too full, it makes the cup too hot for them to hold.",
