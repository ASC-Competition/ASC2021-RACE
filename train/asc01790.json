  "article": "A paperclip,made of steel wire bent into a looped  shape,is an instrument used to hold sheets of paper together.This common device is a wonder of simplicity and function.But where did this simple,cheap,and practical invention come from?\nIn the late 19th century,the most common way to hold papers together was by using a pin.Although the pin was an inexpensive tool and was easily removable,it would 1eave holes in the paper. Later,as steel wire became more common,inventors began to notice its elastic feature. With this feature,it could be stretched and twisted into various clip--like objects.In the years just before 1900,quite a few paperclip designs appeared.The name most frequently associated with the paperclip invention is Johan Vaaler,a Norwegian inventor. However, Vaaler's clips were not the same as the paperclips currently in use.Specifically,they did not have the inside loop we see today.The familiar looped design was invented by Gem Manufacturing Ltd.in England.This clip is therefore sometimes known as the Gem clip.\nBecause of Vaaler,the paperclip played an important historical role in Norway.During World War II,Norway was occupied by the Nazis.Norwegians were prohibited from wearing any symbol of their national unity ,such as buttons with the initials of their king.Thus,in protest,they started wearing paperclips to show their unity.The reason for doing this was simple:Paperclips were a Norwegian invention whose original function was to bind together.After the war,a giant paperclip statue was put up in Oslo to honour Vaaler--even though his design was never actually produced.",
