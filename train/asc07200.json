  "article": "\"This is really a very fast game, the fastest I've seen so far this year. Both sides are fighting for the ball all the time. The crowd is loving every minute of it. They are shouting at the top of their voices.\"\n\"Wills has the ball now. This is only his third game for Scotland, but he's playing so well that it won't be his last. I'm quite sure.\"\n\"Wills passes the ball to Cotton. Cotton kicks it over the heads of the waiting Frenchmen, towards the goalmouth. But he's too far away, Dupond picks it up easily, and throws it to Patou, put on the left.\"\n\"France and Scotland still have one goal each, and there are only two minutes left of the game. But during that time, anything can happen. Patou kicks the ball across to Croat. It is a beautiful kick, but Steven jumps and just stops the ball with the side of his head. Meunier is there. He passes to Crozat, and Crozat, without waiting a second, puts the ball into the back of the goal. It takes everybody by surprise. I have never seen a goal like it.\"\n\"The game is over. France has won the cup.\"",
