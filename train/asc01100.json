  "article": "Imagine having an idea, drawing it on paper, bringing it to a store and seeing it turned into a physical object.This is now possible with the help of 3D printers.Such machines were once used just by universities and big companies.But now, stores with 3D printing services are appearing around the United States.\nBryan Jaycox and his wife opened The Build Shop LLC in Los Angeles two years ago.The store is filled with tools like a laser cutter, an industrial sewing machine and 3D printers.Bryan Jaycox requires $ 15 an hour to print an object.He also charges a fee depending on the size of the object and up to $ 50 an hour for design and labor services.\nThe Jaycoxs also offer 3D printing classes for anyone who is interested.One of the students in a recent class was Ki Chong Tran.He plans to open a 3D printing business in Cambodia.\"The demand has been amazing.It's been much more than I would have imagined,\" said Ki Chong Tran.\n\"I think 3D printing is going to be huge. It's going to make a huge impact on society as a whole,\" he added.\nMr Jaycox predicts that within five years, 3D printing technology could become\nmore consumer friendly.\nBut Ki Chong Tran says even current technology can make a difference in a developing country like Cambodia.\"With 3D printing you can give them tools, and you put it in their hands so they are responsible more for their own development.\nThey learn skills beyond just learning English and becoming a tour guide or something like that or working at a bank.You can actually create things that give value to the world,\" said Ki Chong Tran.\nHe says it's not just Cambodia but anywhere where there is a 3D printer, it can turn a good idea into reality.",
