  "article": "Here are three students' stories about studying in another country.\nMariko Okada - Tokyo\nMy year in the USA was full of fun. I like speaking to others, so I got lots of speaking practice. I also learned lots of interesting things about America. When I got home, my friends said I was better! I hope to go back to America again in the future.\nCarla Fonseca - Rio de Janeiro\nI spent last year studying English in London. There were so many people to talk to there, but I always felt bad about my English. I missed my family very much. I think it was great to study in London, but I'm glad to be at home!\nAlvin Chen - Hong Kong\nStudying in New Zealand was lots of hard work! I had English classes six hours a day, five days a week. I also kept a diary. I like writing, and I wrote about many things in my diary every day. On Saturdays, my homestay   family took me to lots of interesting places and showed me so many wonderful things. I was really glad to stay there for a year!",
