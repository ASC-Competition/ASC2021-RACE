If you want to ask somebody to answer the telephone, you cannot say, \" Please ask Mr/Mrs/Miss... to answer the telephone.\" Instead, you must say, \" May I speak to Mr/Mrs/Miss..., please?\" If you want to ask who is answering the telephone, you should say \" Who is that?\" or \" Is that ...( somebody ) speaking?\" instead of \" Who are you ?\". If you want to tell the other one who you are, you should say, \" This is ...( somebody ) speaking.\"",
