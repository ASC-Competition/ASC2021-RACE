  "article": "Long queues at cinemas buying hot tickets for blockbusters  will become rare as Beijing residents will be able to order film tickets via cell phone networks in a month.\nFilm ticket circulation service on cell phone, also called the \"Green channel of film tickets ordering\", is aiming at lowing the cost of ticket circulation and easing the ticket distribution pressure on such popular film-watching days as summer and winter vacations or Valentine's Day.\n\"People log onto the net through cell phones, then choose cinema seats, _ , browse information for new films and read cinema introductions,\" said Guan Zheng, the publicity chief of Xingmei Digital Media Company Ltd., the service provider.\n\"Film fans can enjoy various discount prices if they order tickets via cell phones,\" Guan said.\nMeanwhile, the cell phone ticket circulation platform provides subscribers general mobile phone services like jokes, videos, flashes, phone ring downloads and games.\nThe service is about to be put into trial at the Beijing-based Xingmei International Cinema for a month before being putting into use at other cinema chains both in and outside Beijing, as the service is going to be improved through gradual expansion, said Guan.\nChina's film industry that is being restored has seen more and more enthusiastic moviegoers. Up to the end of 2009, China has had more than 5,000 specialized cinemas, among which there are 2,243 modern cinemas with 3, 668 silver screens and 56 cinema chains.\nCurrently, many people buy film tickets on the Internet or by phoning the cinema's ticket office or simply queuing at the cinema gate. More people want to buy tickets on popular days like May Day holiday, National Day holiday or Valentine's Day. Yet the inefficient ticket circulation system contributes the most to the failure.",
