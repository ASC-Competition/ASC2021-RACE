To be frank, my work is terribly busy but interesting. I can always meet patients in different conditions. One 'of my patients is a successful businessman. Cancer has changed his _ on life. \" Happiness is like a cookie in a boy's hand, \" he said. \"If a young kid gets the cookie, everything will be good. With no cookie, life loses its color. When a boy becomes a man, the cookie may turn into money, a new car, or a beautiful house. \"\n\"It took me many years to understand that the cookie never makes you happy for long. If the cookie is in front of you, you may care for it. But sometimes you may not get a chance to eat it, and then you are busy trying not to lose it. Having the cookie is not what life is about. After having cancer, for me, the cookie starts to lose its meaning. It is the most important that you can live a happy life with or without the cookie, \" he said.\n,.",
