  "article": "Rainy days may ruin some cheerful plans for outdoor activities, but it doesn't have to be boring inside. On the next rainy day, try some of these ideas for a day full of fun: \nTell stories. You might tell old stories you heard when you were growing up, or you might make up some really fascinating stories just for the kids. Let them all have a turn at making up stories of their own. \nPlay in the kitchen. Let the kids help you cook a pizza or maybe some cookies. Give them a chance to help you in the kitchen and make something delicious. Just make sure they remember that part of cooking is cleaning up.\nWrite a story together. Let the kids come up with a story of their own. They might want to write stories individually and then read them aloud to others, or they might want to get together and write a story together.\nPlay \"let's pretend\" games. Let the kids pretend to be teachers, doctors, nurses or policemen. Let them dress up in whatever you may have. Then let them play the roles. You might even volunteer to be the student or the patient. \nHave a party. Let the kids pick out some music and dance around the room. Then,\nlet them fall all over themselves with laughter, when you show them how it was done when you were a kid. \nUse these ideas to get you started, and the kids may actually start wishing for more\nrainy days.",
