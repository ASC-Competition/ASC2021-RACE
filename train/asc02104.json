Although 40 percent said that the main reason for going away is to escape pressure   from work, almost all said they worry more than they do at home. Only four in every 100 said that they are happy and free of care.\nThe most common worry is burglary ( ) , with four out of 10 worrying about their homes being broken into while they're abroad.More than a quarter fear they will feel crazy with some other noisy and rough holiday-makers and 22 percent worry they may be attacked or their possessions will be missing. One in five think the car may break down; and the same number worry about the chances of bad weather.\nThe survey also showed that the stay-at-home Americans are no more. Three out of every five want to have a holiday abroad, a great increase from the figures only three years ago. The hotel holiday is still a winner, with about one third of all Americana preferring to go on a self-catering (  ) holiday.",
