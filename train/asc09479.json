  "article": "A businessman lost his wallet. There was plenty of money in it. So he made a promise, \"If someone finds my wallet and returns it to me, I'll give half the money to him.\"\nA dustman found the wallet in a dustbin. He sent it back to the loser. But the businessman changed his mind.\n\"There was still a diamond ring in my wallet,\" said the loser, \"I won't give half the money in my wallet to you until you return it to me!\"\n\"I've never seen a diamond ring in the wallet,\" said the dustman.\nThey began to quarrel. The businessman refused to do what he had said. The dustman became angry and took him before a judge.\nAfter the judge heard what had happened to them, he said to the businessman, \"I'm sure you are an honest man. It's true that you have lost a wallet in which there was a diamond ring. But it's also clear that there is only a lot of money in this wallet. I don't think it's yours. Wait for some time. Perhaps someone will be able to return your wallet to you!\"\nThen the judge turned to the dustman and said, \"Take the wallet home. If the loser doesn't go to get it back in three days, it will belong to you!\"",
