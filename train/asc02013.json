  "article": "There are times when nothing seems to be working in our favor. We may use complaining as a coping mechanism (,) when we are truly unhappy. However, there are many times when we don't try our best and just want things to work our way. We may try to cover our faults by complaining about the unfairness of it all. These are expressive complaints where the complainer just wants to let out his/her anger or frustration, with no real intention of solving the problem. The complainer expects pity and recognition from the listeners although the results often disappoint him/her.\nSometimes, we use complaints as a conversation starter. Conversations that start with a complaint often have a domino effect. It may cause the listener to include his/her complaints in the conversation as well, which makes you think that you are not the only one facing problems. However, your good feeling won't last long as long as you are always focusing on the negative.\nWhen complaining becomes a habit, you complain to anyone that comes around. Negativity that comes from complaining kills creativity and innovation  . Habitual complainers are less likely to come up with new ideas, as they are busy finding faults and discourage others from trying new things by making them feel that they won't work. When you spend time with people who constantly complain, you are likely to view things in a negative light. This will make things worse. This can affect the way you perceive your own situation, and even the people around you.\nThough expressing your feelings may momentarily improve your state of mind, it could sometimes have a bad effect on the listener's state of mind. A recent study has shown that at social gatherings while people who are unhappy may join you when you play the victim at the beginning, the majority would start avoiding you because of your negativity.",
