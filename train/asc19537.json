  "article": "I have a lot of friends. My best friend is Mai. She is 16 years old. She is 2 years older than me. We live in the same town and we began to know each other when we were very young. Now we are classmates. Mai is tall and thin, with long black hair. She has an oval face   with big eyes, a high nose and a small mouth. Mai is helpful  . When her friends have difficulties, she always tries her best to help them. Mai is one of the best students in our class. I like studying with her. She always helps me with my studies. Although we have the same hobbies and interests, we also have some differences. I am sociable and enjoy telling jokes. Mai, however, is serious and quiet. We believe in each other, so we are good friends. I hope we can keep our friendship forever  .",
