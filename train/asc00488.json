  "article": "People smile at times. However, the meaning of a smile in different cultures may be different. Depending on different cultures, smiling can express joy and amusement, but it can also show embarrassment .\nPeople in the United States smile a lot. Every one smiles at each other in order to show they are open and friendly. However, in China, smiling is not only an expression of happiness, but also a way to avoid being embarrassed. Chinese people like smiling when they are embarrassed in order to avoid embarrassment. Smiling is a kind of good will but not sneer . For example: When a child falls down from a bike, the adults in China may smile, which is a kind of gentle encouragement and not a kind of impolite laugh.\nWhen a person from the United States might blush with embarrassment or become offensive , a Chinese might blush with smile. To avoid serious misunderstanding, people who engage in intercultural   communication should be able to understand the meaning of smiling properly.",
