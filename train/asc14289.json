He liked walking from the station to his office unless it was raining, because it gave him some exercise.\nOne morning he was walking along the street when a stranger stopped him and said to him, \"You may not remember me, sir, but seven years ago I came to London without a penny in my pockets, I stopped you in this street and asked you to lend me some money, and you lent me PS 5, because you said you were willing to _ so as to give a man a start on the way to success.\"\nMr. Grey thought for a few minutes and then said, \"Yes, I remember you.
