  "article": "Today, people want to keep healthy through sports and exercise. But some of them have some wrong ideas about it.\n\"A plate of chicken is a good meal before games because it has much energy.\"\nIn fact, the best meal before games should have carbohydrates . Food like potatoes, bread, bananas are rich (......) in it, but chicken and meat are not.\n\"The best time to exercise is early in the morning.\"\nNo. Morning is a good time to exercise, but it may not be suitable for you. If an afternoon or evening period is suitable for you, and you enjoy the feeling of getting healthier, you can choose any time to exercise. So there is no _ time for you to exercise.\n\"If you drink water when you exercise, you'll feel tired.\"\nThe fact is that you must have some water during breaks   when you exercise. And after exercising, you must have enough water. If you don't drink enough water, then you may feel tired.\n\"Exercising every day is quite important.\"\nWrong. Too much exercise is bad for our health. You need to give your body a day of rest.",
