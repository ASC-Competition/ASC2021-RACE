  "article": "For many workers trying to lose weight, the weekend is a chance to do some exercise and eat something healthier than a supermarket sandwich at their desk. But some slimmers take a slightly different approach -- consuming more than half their weekly calorie intake from Friday night to Sunday.\nAway from the daily routine at work that helps them keep control of what they eat, they are snacking and drinking their way to a shocking 10,000 calories, a survey has found. Almost three-quarters of people trying to lose weight admit to over-eating at the weekend. A meal with friends or family, complete with alcohol, as well as a late-night snack before bed, can lead to adults consuming up to 3,500 calories in one day, a survey found. Men typically need 2,500 calories a day and women 2,000 calories. Consuming this amount would see men and women get through half their weekly calorie intake over the course of a 'bad' weekend.\nWomen were found to eat less on a Sunday because of guilt over their consumption over the previous two days. Men had fewer doubts about a third day of excess.\nThe biggest weekend diet danger comes from snacking between meals, the survey found. Some say they will often spend Saturday night in front of the TV with their families -- combining watching their favorite shows with crisps and biscuits. And seven in ten people admitted to having fattening takeaways at weekends, with pizza the most popular. Alcohol is another big factor in weekend bingeing.Around 70 percent still like to have a roast on a Sunday or a big meal with family or friends and a third of those will have second helpings.\nA spokesman from Forza Supplements, the diet company that conducted the survey, said, \"We all have bad weekends where we have a lot of fun, but dieting goes out of the window.\"\nThe 5:2 diet is becoming increasingly popular -- where we limit our calories for five days and allow ourselves a few treats on the other two days.\n\"For many people, the two days off are Saturday and Sunday but they go way too far\"",
