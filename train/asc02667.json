  "article": "In the famous fairy tale, Snow White eats the Queen's apple and falls victim to a curse; in Shakespeare's novel, Romeo drinks the poison and dies; some ancient Chinese kings took pills that contained mercury, believing that it would make them _ , but they died afterwards.\nPoison has long been an important part in literature and history, and it seems to always be about evil, danger and death. But how much do you really know about poison?\nAn exhibition, The Power of Poison, opened last month at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, intended to give the audience a more vivid understanding of poison. The exhibition will continue until Feb. 2016, reported The New York Times.\nThe museum tour starts in a rainforest setting, where you can see live examples of some of the most poisonous animals: caterpillars, frogs and spiders. Golden poison frogs, for instance, aren't much bigger than a coin, but their skin is covered in a poison that can cut off the signaling power of your nerves, and a single frog has enough venom to kill 10 grown humans.\nThe exhibition also features interactive activities. In an iPad-based game, visitors are presented with three puzzling illnesses and asked to identify the poisons based on symptoms. In one case, for example, a pet dog is found sick in a backyard and visitors have to figure out whether it was the toad  , the leaky batteries in the trash or the dirty pond water that did it.\n\"Poisons can be bad for some things,\" Michael Novacek, senior vice president of the museum, told NBC News. \"Yet they can also be good for others.\"\nThis is what visitors learn from the last part of the exhibition, which displays how poisons can be used favorably by humans, including for medical treatment.\nThe blood toxins of vampire bats, for example, can prevent blood from clotting  , which may protect against strokes. A poisonous chemical found in the yew tree is effective against cancer, which is what led to the invention of a cancer-fighting drug called Taxol. One chemical in the venom of Gila monsters can lower the blood sugar of its victims, so it has been used to treat diabetes.",
