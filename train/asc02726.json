  "article": "\"Developed and developing nations can learn from each other seeking a low-carbon economy. In terms of energy saving and green economy, China doesn't _ developed nations,\" said Zhou Changyi, director of the energy saving department of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.\n\"While we can learn many aspects from developed nations, they also should learn something from us, such as water conservation,\" Zhou said in a speech during the new Path of China's Industrialization forum at the ongoing China International Industry Fair.\nHe said industrialized nations and China are dealing with different issues to fight climate change. The United Kingdom, for example, is concerned about transport, buildings and new energy in reducing carbon emissions. For China, the most urgent task is how to realize new type of industrialization and avoid mistakes that other countries made when they industrialized.\nSwiss power and automation technology group ABB called for a stronger focus on product life-cycle assessment, or LCA, which is used to study the environmental impact of a product from the research and manufacturing stage through its usage and recycling.\nTobias Becker, head of ABB' s process automation division for North Asia and China, said LCA is an effective tool in helping manufacturing industries to reduce carbon emissions.\nLCA shows that industrial customers should focus on a product's environmental impact throughout its life-cycle instead of on its initial investment.\nRichard Hausmann, North East Asia CEO of Siemens, said, \"The color of future industrialization is green. \"\nThe Germany company recently announces that it wants to receive orders worth more than 6 billion Euros ( US 8. 8 billion) for intelligent power networks, Smart Grid, over the next five years. Siemens has set a 20 percent market share target for the global smart grid business.\nA smart grid delivers electricity from suppliers to consumers using digital technology, advanced sensors specialized computers that save energy, reduce costs and increase reliability. The United States and China are considered the two biggest markets for smart grid.",
