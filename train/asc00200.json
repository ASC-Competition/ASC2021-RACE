  "article": "Jennifer Lynn is turning into a master storyteller. She writes about young adults brilliantly. However, I have got to say Stay With Me wasn't my favorite in this series, but I still really enjoyed it and I would absolutely recommend it to fans interested in the world of young adults.\nStay With Me is the third book in Jennifer's Wait For You series, which features a couple that have been in previous books but have their own unique story and can be read as a standalone. I like that about this series. It's nice to be able to pick up a book and read it, finish it and move on to the next, but the Wait For You series has the added bonus of a more deeper character connection, as theyve appeared previously, you have more of a feel for them and you look forward to their story.\nStay With Me is Calla and Jaxs story. Calla has a wreck  of a mother, but she is finally coming to the end of college and is looking forward to a career in nursing. She has done pretty well up for herself and now it was her time to shine. Unluckily, it falls through when her mother robbed her of every penny and took her identity. Calla has to go back to her small home town and into the arms of Jax.\nJax is handsome and cheerful! He is a waiter in a bar and knows Calla's mother very well and he agrees to help Calla. He is true alpha, with a sweet side and is very protective of Calla. I loved him, but not as much as Cam, sorry Jax! And that's why Stay with Me isn't as good as Cam's book, Wait for You. Don't get me wrong. Jax is an incredibly great character, well fleshed out and I did care for him, but he just wasn't as lovely as Cam.\nAs for Calla, I liked her character, and I liked the connection between her and Jax. I loved how he _ and showed her to love herself, despite her unsatisfactory past. There are a lot of intense moments between these two characters and they are so well written. Jennifer's writing is addictive and she wrote the scenes between Jax and Calla beautifully. Calla has never been, what she would call boyfriend material, and so she struggles to see what Jax sees in her and she bats him off and ignores it. There's a lot of push and pull between them, and it's very charming. At times I did get a little annoyed with Calla, especially with her insecurity but Jax soon made up for that!\nOverall I really enjoyed Stay with Me. Anyway, they are a wonderful pair together. Despite all the troubles that Calla was going through, their relationship seemed more realistic and was made to last.",
