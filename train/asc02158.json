  "article": "Ibrahim became disabled after contracting polio   when he was three years old. At first his parents, like many other parents of disabled children in Niger, did not want to send him to school. They were worried he would be laughed at by his classmates.\nDespite his disability, and his parents' doubts, Ibrahim was determined to go to school. \"When I was eight,\" Ibrahim says, \"other kids of my age were going to school while I stayed at home. I did not like that. So, I pestered   my parents until they finally let me go to school.\"\nIbrahim's parents sent him to a private school nearby. Although the journey to and from school was a short one, it still wasn't easy for Ibrahim. He had to use his hands to help him move along, protecting them with plastic slippers. But at least he was getting an education.\nHowever, after only a year in school, Ibrahim's education was interrupted when his parents separated. His mother did not have the means to continue paying for his tuition.\nIn 2007, Ibrahim received some money to be fitted with a leg brace  , corrective shoes and his first pair of crutches  . Now that he was more mobile than before, the most important thing for him was to find a way to go back to school.\n\"I wanted to start school again last October,\" Ibrahim says. \"After my mother told me she could not afford it, I went to visit some of my relatives for support. And I collected 5,000 francs CFA (US $8) to pay my tuition for half a year. I will find the rest of the money somehow.\"\nIbrahim attends a school in which he is the only disabled student. According to his teacher, he is among the top five students in a class of 55.",
