  "article": "Chinese scientist Tu Youyou on October 5 won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine amongst a trio for discovering parasite therapies . 85-year-old Tu is awarded this world-renowned prize for her contribution to reducing the death rate of malaria, minimizing patients' suffering and promoting mankind's health. This is what science is all about.\nTu's finding has saved millions' lives during the 40 years. This also proves the value of her research product. The reward is never too late in that aspect. The moment of joy and satisfaction came when she discovered the artemisinin( ) after all kinds of failures in experiments.\nAs the first Chinese mainland Nobel Prize Winner of natural science award, Tu's winning completely surprised Chinese people, who have long been wondering when the first Chinese Nobel laureate in natural science would appear.\nLet's backtrack to 40 years ago. Tu accomplished the breakthrough findings without access to any advanced equipment, communication with outside world and papers to research. However, over the 40 years, improvements and innovations have transformed everything. Nowadays, Chinese scientists have the passion to invent. As Premiere Li Keqiang mentioned in his letter, \"Tu's winning the prize signifies China's prosperity and progress in scientific and technological field\".\nTu's record-breaking winning serves as a reminder to those who are too eager for instant success. Science is never about instant success. There is no way to measure how much you spend on scientific research and compare it with how much reward you get.",
