  "article": "Scientists from the United States say they have found fish and other creatures living under key waters in Antarctica. They made the announcement after completing three months of research at the Ross Ice Shelf, the world's largest floating ice sheet.\nThe researchers hoped to find clues to explain the force of the melting ice and its effect on sea level rise. Reed Scherer and Ross Powell are with Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois. They just finished up their research on our southernmost continent. Money for the project came from America's National Science Foundation.\n\"We chose a study site where, in the first year ,We went into the subglacial  lake and tried to understand the environment in there, both ecologically and in terms of the ice dynamics about how the lake operates ,and how the sediment  underneath the ice sheet operates, as well, because it's the water and the sediment underneath the ice that controls how fast the ice is flowing into the ocean\" says Ross Powell, who led the investigation. The team included scientists ,engineers, machinery and other supplies across the ice from the main U.S. scientific base at Mc Murdo Station to the researcher's camp .The camp  was near a subglacial lake ,where an earlier study took place,\nRoss Powell says the latest study may provide evidence that can help predict the effect of climate change on rising sea levels.\n\"What we have found is that these are very sensitive areas to the stability of how dynamic the ice is and how fast the ice may react to increases of melting both from the ocean and the atmosphere.\"\nAmong the new instruments built for the project was a powerful hot water drill. The researchers used the drill to dig down some 740 meters. They collected water ,sediment and other material from the grounding zone.\nWorking around the clock before the deep hole refroze, they sent a video camera down to the 400-square-meter undersea area.\nReed Scherer says the video images they saw in the Command Center were a total surprise.\n\"It's a very mobile environment. The bottom is changing constantly. And so the things that we saw were all very mobile organisms, things that swim and some things that crawl. And obviously they are getting enough nutrition that they can thrive, Some of the little crustacean-like creatures called amphipods that we saw swam quite quickly and were quite active.\"\nThis is the farthest south that fish have ever been seen. How did the creatures get here? What do they feed on? And what effect will the retreating ice have on them?\nRoss Powell says the ice and sediment cores taken from the grounding zone can offer clues.\n\"We know that the ice is melting there at the moment and so by opening up the cores once they get back, we hope to be able to understand what the ice was doing in the past ,relative to what it is doing now. And because it is melting so fast or seems to be melting fast at the moment, we anticipate that there will he some differences that we'll see in the history of the ice sheet from the sediment cores, once we open them up .\"But Ross Powell says the work raises more questions than it answers.",
