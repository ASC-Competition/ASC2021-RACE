  "article": "When I'm in trouble, I always take out a book and read quietly. I put my heart into it so that I'll forget all the troubles. I've formed the habit of reading in this way.\nWhen I was a little boy, I was interested in picture books and storybooks. When I was a middle school student, I began to read novels, plays, essays   and so on. I found I could get much from them. Little by little I took great interest in literature   and last term I won the first prize in the composition contest among middle school students in our city.\nReading The Emperor's New Clothes, I had to let out a burst of laughter over his silly action. The Little Match Girl couldn't keep me from crying for her misery  . Robinson Crusoe took me into a strange world full of danger. And I was also deeply impressed   by Helen Keller's perseverance  . Besides these, books also tell me other things -- how to be a brave man and how to tell the difference between the right and the wrong. In a word, good books can make me know what I didn't know before. So I think of good books as my best friends.\nI'll never forget this famous saying, \"Good books are the best friends who never turn their backs upon us.\"",
