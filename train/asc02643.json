  "article": "The first Europeans came to America in 1492 with Christopher Columbus. Since that time people have come to America from all over the world, from Europe, Africa, and Asia, and they have brought their music with them. This mixing of people and music has created American music.\nMusic is a very important part of our lives. Music is for dancing, drinking, eating, loving, and thinking. Some songs remind us of our childhood or youth.\nOthers remind of the people they love. Many important occasions, like weddings and funerals have special music. Every nation has a national song like the American \"The StarSpangled Banner\". In the US high schools and colleges have school songs too.\nMusic is a part of the history of America. It expresses the problems and feelings of its people. As the years pass, the music grows and changes.\nModern science has also changed music. Inventions like records, radios, movies, electric instruments, tape recorders, and videos have changed the way we play and listen to music. They have helped to make music an important form of international communication.\nAmerican music, from the earliest folk songs to modern \"pop\", is known around the world. Music is one of America's most important exports. It brings the people of the world together. Even when people cannot understand the same language, they can share the same music. Many people learn and practise English by singing song. Understanding American music can help you understand American people, their history and culture.\nSo, as the song says, \"put a dime (10 cents)in the juke box  , baby. Let's listen to the music!\"",
