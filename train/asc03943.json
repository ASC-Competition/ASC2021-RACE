  "article": "I have had all kinds of interesting neighbors since the early days of my life. When I was a baby I would stand in my wooden crib  and watch the world go by through the window. Some neighbors watched me watching the world go by with by big, wondering eyes and found me very interesting. They used to call me \"the beauty at the window\".\nThe early neighbors I could remember were from the second house I lived in. Peter and Paul were twins. We went to play school together although they were a year older than me. I well remember the Alsatian they had which ran into me when I was invited to their fifth birthday party. Needless to say, I was well-known for my loud screams after the party. But they said the pet was scared of my screams and didn't appear until the party was over.\nPeter and Paul were the first boys who encouraged me to climb the gate. I could never tell the difference between boy and girl behaviors--I just did what I thought was fun. Not only did I have a great time performing that first climb, I also got my skirts dirty, and was criticized by my mother.\nThe Japanese neighbors I had living in this same house were my favorite, as they introduced me to sea-salt baked shrimps   which were so crisp that you could eat the shrimp totally. They gave me some seaweed for my birthday. Thankfully, no other member in my family enjoyed the seaweed as I did. Perhaps what my mother used to joke to me was true, that I was picked up out of the dustbin that belonged to a Japanese home.\nMaybe sometimes it is difficult to find good neighbors in this society. But all it takes is a spark  to get a fire going. I have decided to be that spark wherever I live and pass love on to my neighbors.",
