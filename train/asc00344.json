  "article": "It seems that many parents have a lot to learn about what their children are doing online. According to a recent survey by the Symantec Corporation, which makes many kinds of security software for home and business computers, there's a \"significant digital divide between parents and their kids.\"\nParents of children under the age of 18 were asked to estimate how much time their kids spent online each week. The parents said about three hours a week on average. The kids - ages 8 to 17 - who took the survey said they're spending an average of seven hours online each week.\n\"I really think that's due to the time they spend on their mobile phones and computers, when their parents don't even know they're online,\" says Symantec's Bill Rosenkrantz. \"Remember, cell phones, PDAs and video game machines all make it possible to access the Internet. You don't have to sit in front of a computer screen.\"\nAnd what are the kids doing on the Web? \"They're doing things like downloading music, they're going to social networking sites, they're actually shopping online when parents don't think they're doing those kinds of activities,\" says Rosenkrantz. \"They're also, we think, doing some things with research papers and other kinds of activities with homework maybe where they're getting content online and they really shouldn't be.\" Nearly a quarter of the kids (23 percent) admit to doing things their parents would not approve.\nSo how does a modern parent deal with this type of situation? \"The first thing we strongly recommend is that parents spend time with their children online,\" Rosenkrantz says. \"Sit down with them and understand what they're doing. Secondly, have a dialog about it. Have a dialog about what's an acceptable activity, what's an unacceptable activity, and set some ground rules -- time online, things you can and can't do. Really have those conversations. That's the most important.\" There are a lot of bad people on the Internet. That's why it's so important for parents to know what their kids are doing online.",
