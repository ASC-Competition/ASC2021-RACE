  "article": "There is an interesting, but at the same time a sad phenomenon now: there is a rise in the number of singers and bands that have little to do with good music.Many singers or bands know little about what good music means.What is the cause of this rise?\nMost of these singers have taken music as a \"job\" because it is a good source of making money.And if you have a good appearance and also expensive clothes to show off at your concerts or at different appearances in public, then your voice is not as important as it should be.The public will prefer to admire more the most interesting parts of your body, whether you are a girl or a boy.They will even forget about the fact that you are there to show your music skills, not your dancing, which is important too, but not at such a high level.\nTherefore, we can see many young girls on TV who look very good but who have nothing to do with music.They choose to wear very provocative clothes to catch attention, but when it comes to singing they are a complete mess and one doesn't need to have an ear for music to notice their lack of talent.But anyway, they have concerts and they enjoy travelling from one place to another.It is the public's fault because they accept this and are pleased with this commercial music.People who enjoy this kind of music are generally young people while adults prefer listening to old good bands.\nHowever, the young generation should understand while appearance is important, it is less important than talent and a good voice.If somebody has a great voice and wants to become a singer, he should take some special courses in this area, because they will help them improve singing abilities.",
