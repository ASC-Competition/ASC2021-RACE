There are one thousand and four hundred students and one hundred and forty teachers in my school. I like the teachers. They are very kind to me. My classmates are very friendly , too. They teach me Chinese and I teach them English.\nThere are trees, flowers and green grass in my school. They are very beautiful. Behind my school there is a small river. The water in it is quite clean. We can swim in it.\nWe have no classes on Saturdays or Sundays. Sometimes I go to play football or basketball with my classmates. Sometimes I stay at home and watch TV. Sometimes I go to shops with my father and mother. We all like China.",
