  "article": "Most kids hate to see their summer end, perhaps none more than the Murset children. This summer, the Murset family decided to travel across the country to help families in need, which proved to be a wonderful experience.\nPeople. comreported that Gregg Murset and his wife, Kami, decided to take their six children, ranging from 7 to 16 years old, from their home in Phoenix, Arizona, across the country to spend 20 days on the road to help 25 families in need. \"I told the kids and my wife over breakfast that I wanted to do this,\" Gregg Murset, 40, told People. com. \"They all looked at me like I was crazy,\" he said, \"but when we started to read the stories of people we were going to help, their attitudes completely changed.\"\nThrough Gregg's company, he was able to be matched with groups such as Autism Speaks, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and others that connected the Mursets to families with children who have cancer and other serious illnesses.\n\"When you have a kid who is struggling, the last thing you're thinking of is cleaning the house,\" says Gregg.\nThe family traveled to many cities in their journey, including Albuquerque, Denver, Kansas City, Chicago, and Buffalo. The trip covered 6,500 miles. \"It's been amazing to watch my own children open their eyes and see that the world is bigger than they think,\" he said. \"Even the little kids are learning from this experience.\"\nAnd the families they've helped feel blessed to have met them. \"They showed up at 8 a.m. and we had a list of things we needed help with,\" said Jim Spencer, a 61-year-old father in Warren, Michigan, whose 12-year-old daughter, Lexi, was diagnosed  with cancer a couple of years ago.\nThe Mursets also used their travels as an opportunity to visit areas they had never been to, including the Statue of Liberty. But for Gregg, the main purpose of the trip was to teach his children to show concern for the happiness of other people rather than for themselves.\n\"There is nothing wrong with your kid getting off the sofa, doing some work and sweating,\" said Gregg. \"It's good for the kid and it's good for the soul.\"",
