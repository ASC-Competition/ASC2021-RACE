  "article": "A new study suggests that the way to weight loss may be clear.A couple of glasses of water before meals help dieters lose about 5 pounds more than those who do not drink water.While drinking water before a meal may fill a person up,the contents of their meal are important as well.Should a person be eating a low-fat diet or a lowcarbohydrate   diet? Or does it matter at all?\nRecent research suggests that one diet isn't any better than the other.A few weeks before the water study,another concluded that lowfat and lowcarbohydrate diets tied in weight loss.While the lowcarbohydrate dieters did show a slight increase in good cholesterol   and a reduction in blood pressure,there was not much difference in the dieters'weight loss.The point here is that the person had to stick to the diet.What helps a person see a diet through? It could be body type.\nA study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,as reported byTimemagazine,found that body shape is the key to which diet a person will be able to stick with.Apples are people who carry most of their weight above the belt,while pears carry their weight around their hips  .Apple types were more likely to be highinsulin secretors   who respond more strongly to carbohydrates in their bodies.They lost the most weight on a lowcarbohydrate diet.Pears were lowinsulin secretors who lost the same amount of weight on both diets.Unstable   insulin levels can create stronger hunger senses,causing the apple types to go off their diet plans.\nAll of these studies again come down to choosing the diet that helps you eat less.The bodytype diet does make some sense as men are more likely to be apple types,with larger stomachs,and tend to do well on higherprotein diets,while women,who tend to carry weight around their hips,find themselves drawn to the lowfat diets.The reality is if a diet is failing you try another one.A plan you can't,or won't,stick to will never work,no matter what the research says.",
