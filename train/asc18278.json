  "article": "Following the success of S. H. E and Twins, another girl band . has arrived on the music scene. Eighteen-year-old Singaporean twin sisters Yumi and Miko Bai create the magic in the band BY2.\nThe pair recently released their second album, Twins.\nWith great voices and dance moves to match, the cute   sisters have won the hearts of many fans since their first album NC-16 came out last year.\nAt a young age,the sisters began to learn ballet dancing and the violin. When a music company wanted to work with them, the girls had to leave their home and parents to go to Taiwan for training.\nMiko and Yumi dropped out of school to focus on their music. This decision caused a hot debate in Singapore. Some people said that their mother was using her daughters to make money. But their father, who died of cancer when they were 15 years old, had encouraged the girls to work hard to make their dreams come true.\nThe girls felt lonely in Taiwan when they first arrived. \" We celebrated our birthday in Taiwan without any family and friends,\" Yumi said. \" We cut our birthday cake ourselves. \"\nThe girls faced many challenges. \"We had to learn Mandarin. Also, it was a killer to dance in high heels, \" said the twins,who had to do so in their music videos.\nHowever,they are glad that they entered the entertainment scene at an early age. \" When we are younger, we learn things faster and can gain more experience, \" Yumi said.",
