  "article": "We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer.  We usually go to Lake Arrowheads for a few weeks, but we'd like to go somewhere else this year. We're tired of doing the same thing summer after summer. Some friends of ours suggested us go to Hawaii. That would be wonderful. I' m sure we would enjoy a trip like that, but of course it's impossible. First, it would be rather expensive, and second, there would not be enough time. If we're lucky enough to save some money between now and next summer, and if I'm lucky enough to get four weeks of vacation instead of two weeks, maybe we can go to Hawaii next year. In fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it would be good to stay home and not to go to any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I would like to work instead of taking two weeks off: then maybe my boss would suggest that I should be given four weeks' vacation instead of two weeks.",
