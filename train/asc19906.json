  "article": "As we all know, people couldn't live without water. Some parts of our bodies are made of water. We depend on clean water to live every day.\nHowever, we human beings are polluting water seriously. In some areas of China, people are still in great need of clean water. Dirty water is one of the world's biggest healthy problems. It's harmful to our health. When water from the rain and melting  snow runs through roads, it picks up some dangerous chemicals and other things along the way. Many of the rivers are short of protections, so they are easy to be polluted by factories or animals' waste.\nWorld Water Day has grown to become one of the important dates since 1993. In 2013, World Water Day shares the topic of Water Cooperation. If everyone tries their best to save and protect the clean water, our living conditions will be much better.\n,.",
