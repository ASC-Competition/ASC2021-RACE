  "article": "Anne is six years older than me. Growing up, we were very poor, and my mother worked evenings at a factory in a small town. Not seeing my mother much, Anne looked after me and my younger sister.  During those hard years, Anne was always there for me, not only as a big sister, but as a mother and my best friend.\nWhen I was seventeen and had no money, I thought my only chance of going to college was if I could win a scholarship. I had an important interview for such an award. Anne at that time was struggling, surviving on a part-time job as she put herself through the local community college after serving in the army.  I told her of my interview.  I asked her advice on what to wear and showed her my best outfit   and how I planned to be careful, how I sat so that the hole in the bottom of my shoes would not be seen, but I wasn't sure what I would do if it rained.\nAnne suggested that we go shopping, and we took the bus to the JCPenney store. We found a beautiful pair of leather shoes on sale. She told me to try them on, but I thought it was just for fun as neither of us had ever owned anything that expensive before. But Anne handed me the boxed shoes and said, \"Here, I'll buy these for you.\"\n\"But . . .\" was all I could say.\n\"You deserve them,\" she replied. \"This interview is important. I want to see you get that scholarship.\"\nI was speechless as I knew this was a lot of money for her, and she would probably have to eat nothing but noodles for at least a month.\nI went to the interview and crossed my legs so that my beautiful new shoes shone with pride. I won the scholarship and became an engineer. Although they were nice leather everyday shoes, I didn't wear them much because they were so special.  Now, after 20 years have passed, I still have that pair of shoes with me, and I just wear them on those occasions when I need to feel special.",
