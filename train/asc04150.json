  "article": "One cold day in winter, my wife and I were walking back home from the grocery store as usual when we suddenly decided to walk into a coffee shop.\nMy wife ordered a coffee at the counter. Just then, I saw a young woman in her thirties helping with a rather weak Mexican woman into the shop. Maybe it was the gentleness of their difficult experiences or an unclear familiarity   with the situation that drew my full attention. I immediately had a strong wish to do something for them. Unfortunately, before I could think of anything reasonable to say, they left the coffee shop without ordering anything!\nWhen my wife returned, I told her about the two women and said, \"I missed the chance to do something for them.\" Strangely enough, though, they came back into the same coffee shop five minutes later. Unbelievable! \"This is my chance,\" I thought out loud as my wife shared some creative possibilities. The two women ordered, took their place card and left the counter.\nAfter quickly finishing our coffee, we walked up to the counter and asked the smiling cashier  , \"What is your most popular dessert  ?\" Chocolate Cake,\" she answered. With a childlike feeling of happiness, my wife made an unusual order. \"Can I buy a chocolate cake for the two women who were here just before us? But don't tell them it is from us. Just give them this card,\" she said while taking out a smile card. The cashier couldn't believe it. \" Do you do this all the time?\" she asked. \" Not all the time, but just whenever the heart calls for it,\" I answered with a natural smile.\nWe, my wife and I, are people of middle income  . That night, we had planned to have our once-in-a-while dinner at a restaurant. But walking out of that coffee shop, both of us stood upright and said, \"Let's eat at home today.\" It's more filling   to give a chocolate cake than to eat it.",
