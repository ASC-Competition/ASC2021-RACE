  "article": "Mr. Smith had a hotel near the biggest train station in London. A lot of foreigners stayed there for the night. Mr. Smith only knew English, so he found it not easy for him to understand the people from other countries such as Russia, France and Japan. He thought Russian was boring but Japanese was interesting. So he asked a friend of his who knew Japanese to teach him. He studied hard and happily. At first he learned some, but soon he found that it wasn't easy to remember Japanese words. His friend asked him to write down the useful words on his notebook so that he could use them. He did as he was told. He found it helpful for him to do so.\nOne evening, there were a lot of people in the dinning room of his hotel. They were all busy eating something, but a Japanese was walking up and down there. He seemed to be waiting for someone. Mr. Smith thought to himself, \" Maybe the man is hungry and wants to eat something, but he doesn't know any English. I'll try to help him.\"\nBecause Mr. Smith knew only a little Japanese, he had to take out his notebook and showed the sentence \" I am very hungry\" to the Japanese.\nTo his surprise, the Japanese took a look at it and gave him two dollars, and then left the hotel.\n,.",
