  "article": "Sally came to China last year. She is now living in Beijing and works in a computer company. She has been in the company for six months. The company is in the north of the city, and her flat is in the south. But Sally has never been late for work.\nSally is very popular in the company. She is kind to everybody and gets on well with her workmates. They often visit each other after work and talk about almost everything.\nHowever, Sally has made a decision to leave the company. She is going to find a job as a tour guide. \"If I work as a tour guide, I'll be able to meet more people and learn more about China,\" she told her friends.\nLast Friday Sally had a talk with the manager of a travel agency. He seemed pleased with her Chinese. At the end of the talk, the manager said, \"I'll call you up in a week and tell you the result.\" Now Sally is waiting for the answer.",
