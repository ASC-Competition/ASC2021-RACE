Her mother, May Hobson, 40, said, \"I told the bus driver that my baby had just had heart operation and that she was having a heart failure. He said he couldn't go through the traffic.\"\nTed Garretson, 28, a passenger who had tried to bring back Nicole's life, said the driver did nothing to help and stopped once to pick up more passengers.\nWhen the driver reached a corner where he was to make a turn, a block from the hospital, he told Mrs. Hobson to get off, she said.\nA transit spokesman said the driver should have made radio call to the control center for help.",
