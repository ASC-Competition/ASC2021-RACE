  "article": "Health experts have discovered that adding low-calorie vegetable soup to the start of a meal can actually help to lose weight.\nBecause you feel full sooner, you eat less of your main course.\nThe soup regime was tested by researchers at Pennsylvania State University, led by Dr Barbara Rolls.\nThey found that when people ate a first course of soup before lunch they reduced their total calorie intake by 20 per cent, compared with those who did not begin the meal with soup.\nBut those who _ creamy soups should be careful.Researchers stressed the soup must be low-calorie and based on stock , not cream.\nAll of the soups tested in the study were made from identical ingredients - chicken stock , broccoli , potato, cauliflower and carrots.\nThey were mixed together to create four different textures and thickness from separate stock and vegetables through to pureed soup.\nScientists thought that thick soups with chunks of vegetables which required chewing might be more filling, but to their surprise they found all forms had the same effect.\nThe findings were presented to the Experimental Biology conference in Washington, DC, and the research was part-funded by the National Institutes of Health.",
