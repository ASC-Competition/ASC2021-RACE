  "article": "I was born in Thailand, where I feel at home. I am used to jumping on to a song taow (red taxi), and squeezing   in between two strangers. I am used to bargaining at the market to get a shirt that I like. I love telling bilingual   jokes and I am used to the surprised looks I get from the Thais when I can speak their language fluently.\nEvery two years my family goes to America for the summer, and every two years my world is turned upside down. The prices of everything are three times what they were in Thailand, but there is the sweet drink Dr. Pepper! And Bluebell Ice-cream! And everything you could imagine! I am amazed at it all, but the biggest change for me is the people. There are white people everywhere. I am not tall but average  , my yellow hair is no longer out of place, and speaking English no longer draws looks. I should feel comfortable. I'm not out of place anymore, and nobody is looking at me, but I feel like they are. Now I feel out of place and different. I'm not used to giving people handshakes and hugs when I meet them for the first time. I get looks when I have trouble figuring out how much money to pay. I know different music, different places, and different fashion. I can't understand these people who have never left their town or city.\nStill, there are quite a few _ about living overseas. I get to meet people from all over the world, and I know how to adjust to   different cultures and places. I have been to places most people see only in geography books. Still, being so different makes it hard to know who you are. I'm not Thai, but I am not American either. I am a mix of both cultures, a third culture kid.",
