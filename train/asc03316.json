  "article": "Here are two places that you may want to pay a visit to.\nSark, Channel Islands\nThis is one of the few places in the world where tradition still stands and the traditional ways are fully respected. The roads here remain not cemented , and are not even paved, and they are completely dark at night as there are no street lights. The residents of Sark are not allowed to drive cars, and if they do, they have to keep them outside Sark. The transportation you can use in Sark includes your legs, bicycles or a horse-drawn carriage. There are no motor vehicles here.\nThere are many activities you can enjoy here during the day, but when the night comes, the only thing you can do outside is look at the sky, which is really great. Because of the lack of artificial lights, the stars are very clearly visible.\nHyderabad, India\nThis southeastern city of India was the city where one of the wealthiest people in the world lived, Mir Osman Ali Khan. Now this city is the place where many global IT brands hold their head offices. But it hasn't lost its historic looks, as it remains surrounded by ancient boulders , and the modern houses recently built are surrounded by traditional gardens and lakes. From the great hotel Taj Falaknuma Palace you can see the Old City where the old Indian tradition is well preserved.\nThe best time to travel to Hyderabad depends on whether you are going for the city itself, or you wish to go to some of the festivals that take place here. The Hyderabad Literary Festival takes place from the 23rdto the 26thof January, while a festival celebrating various cultures, the Deccan Festival, happens from February 25 to March I.",
