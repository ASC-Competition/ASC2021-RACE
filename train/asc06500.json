  "article": "Easter Eggs\nEaster falls officially on the Sunday following the first full moon after March 21. The name Easter itself derives from Europe, the Anglo-Saxon goddess of springtime and sunrise. Christians relate the rising of the sun to resurrection of Jesus, Son of God, and therefore Easter, like Easter, represents rebirth of the soul. \nIt is because of this association of the holiday with rebirth that the egg has long been its chief symbol. The egg was a symbol of spring and fertility (for the egg is the original germ from which all life proceeds) long before the Christian era. The ancient Persians, Greeks and Chinese exchanged eggs at their spring festivals. In Christian times the egg took on a new meaning, symbolizing Christ's tomb---a cold and hard casket from which new life finally broke forth in triumph. In modern times the egg is still the most important part of Easter customs. Egg-rolling contests, egg hunts and egg-dyeing are still very popular with Americans at Easter time. Today Easter is more a family day than a religious holiday. Relatives and friends get together for large Easter dinners. Many American and friends get together for large Easter dinners. Many American cities have Easter parades. People enjoy the return of the milder weather by walking outdoors to display their new spring clothes.",
