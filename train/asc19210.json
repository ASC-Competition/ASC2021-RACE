  "article": "Tom and Fred are talking about the year 2020. \"What will our world be like in the year 2020?\" \"I don't know,\" says Fred. \"What do you think?\" \"Well, no one knows, but it's interesting to guess.\" \"In the year 2020 everyone will carry a pocket computer . The computer will give people the answers to all their problems. We shall all have telephones in our pockets, too, and we'll be able to talk to our friends all over the world. Perhaps we'll be able to see them at the same time. \" \"A lot of people will live and work under the sea. Perhaps there will be big towns, factories and farms under the sea, too. \" \"Machines will do most of the work, and so people will have more holidays, perhaps they'll work only two or three days a week. They'll be able to fly to the moon by spaceship and spend their holidays there. \" \"I'm looking forward to the year 2020. I hope to go to the moon! \" \"And 1 hope I'll be able to live under the sea.\" says Fred. \"Won't that be very interesting? Just like a fish! \"",
