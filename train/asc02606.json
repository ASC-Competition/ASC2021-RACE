  "article": "When people reunite with their loved ones, it's usually all extremely happy moment. But what is their most common response to seeing them again? It may seem strange,but most of the time they break down in tears.\nNow a group of psychologists from Yale University say they have found the reason why, and that crying tears of joy may well be the body's way of keeping emotional balance. \"They seem to take place when people are overtaken by strong positive emotions, and people who do this seem to recover better from those strong emotions,\" Oriana Aragon, the lead researcher said.\nAragon and her fellow psychologists looked at hundreds of participants' emotional responses to different things, including happy reunions and cute babies. Many participants said they would react in a negative or aggressive way to the positive things ---- to cry at happy moments and want to pinch a cute baby's face or even tell them \"I want to eat you up!\" But then researchers found that these people were able to calm down from strong emotions more quickly.\nThere are many other examples of times when people respond to a positive experience with a negative emotional reaction. At an exciting concert, fans scream at their idols . People who have just had a big lottery win are often in floods of tears. \"These findings advance our understanding of how people express and control their emotions, which is importantly related to mental and physical health, the quality of relationships with others, and even how well people work together.\" said Aragon.",
