  "article": "Jeans are very popular especially with teenagers. It's said that the material came originally from Nimes, a city in France. These jeans were particularly created for the sailors, who loved wearing jeans very much. These jeans could be worn when wet and it could even be rolled over with ease. This was particularly useful when the sailors were busy with their everyday work.\nOur favorite pair of blue, jeans was originally worn by workers particularly during World War II. Perhaps the strong and durable  look made these blue jeans popular among all the factory workers. A strange thing that can be noticed happened in the early period of the 1950s when blue jeans worn by teens were considered to be a form of being against others. Besides, adults who wore blue jeans were not allowed to enter a movie theatre. It was only during the 1960s that blue jeans were accepted as a fashion trend in the United States of America. Movie stars wore them in films and in public. Many young people follow them.\nThe different looks of the regular blue jeans which are enjoyed by people were introduced by the mid 1950s. It was Donald Freeland who gave jeans a whole new look and brought it to the front. Originally, jeans were always worn loose. At first, jeans worn by men had the zipper on the front. However, for women, it was on the side. By the late 1960's , the zipper finally was on the front side for women as well.\nToday, there are many new designs that are being created by fashion designers to meet the increasing demands from jean lovers! A pair of basic blue jeans, however, is one such piece of clothing that will never go out of fashion! When you open one's cupboard, there is always one pair of jeans one likes best.",
