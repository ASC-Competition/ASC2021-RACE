  "article": "A man went to buy a piece of meat. As he didn't know how to cook meat, he asked the butcher    to tell him the way of cooking it. The butcher told him how to cook it, \"But I can't remember your words,\" the man said. \"Will you please write them down for me?\" The butcher was kind enough to write them down for him. The man went home happily with the meat in his hand and the note   in his pocket  . A dog followed him on the way. It jumped at him, took the meat away and ran off. The man stood there, not knowing what to do. Then he laughed and said, \"never mind. You don't know how to eat it. The note is still in my pocket.\"",
