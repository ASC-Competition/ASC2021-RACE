  "article": "Talking on a mobile phone is expensive, so a lot of people send text messages. Text messages are much cheaper than talking on a mobile phone, and you can make it cheaper by making the words shorter. You can do this by taking out \"unimportant\" letters in the words and using numbers instead of words (2 =\" to,\" 3 =\" free,\" 4 =\" for,\" 8 =\" ate,\" so h8 =\" hate,\" etc.). You can also keep away from using punctuation  . Here is an example: Do U wnt 2 g 2 th cnma tnite (Do you want to go to the cinema tonight?)\nWhat do you think these text messages mean?\nWhr hv U bn? Iv bn wtng hrs fr a cll.\nIm hm nw, why nt gv me a cll.\nI gt a txt mssge frm my frnd. Shes hvng a prty on Strdy.\nMobile phone users have developed a group of symbols   to show how they feel. They are called emoticons, and there are some examples below. To read an emoticon, you have to look at it sideways. For example, if you say something in a text message that is a joke, you can follow it with a smiling face. Like this: Why didt u call me? I'm so sad.   (\nHere are some others. Can you think of text messages where you could use them?\n) laughing     ( sad    < really sad\nV shouting    |*| asleep   :0 shocked\n8*| surprised    \\*o bored",
