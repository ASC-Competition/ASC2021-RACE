  "article": "Eric and Doris King Turner are packing their bags for New Zealand. They're busy deciding what to pack and what to leave behind in Britain and are making plans to extend their new home in Nelson. Doris is looking forward to getting the garden into shape and Eric has his heart set on a spot of fly fishing. The difference is that Eric is 102, Doris is 87. Eric thinks he's Britain's oldest _ \nIn January next year Eric King Turner and his wife of 12 years will wave goodbye to their neighbors, and set sail from Southampton on the voyage of a lifetime. The ocean liner  Saga Rose will take six weeks to get to Auckland and the couple are expecting a red-carpet welcome from family.\nDoris was born in New Zealand but gave up her homeland when the couple met and married in the late 1990s. But New Zealand is close to both their hearts and the attraction of family and friends, and the good fishing helped to persuade them to move.\nDoris, who has five children and nine grandchildren, supported her husband's application to settle in New Zealand. The paperwork took five months. Eric says, \"We not only had to produce a marriage certificate  but we had to produce evidence that we were in a long and stable relationship!\" He also said he was not asked about his age but had to show that he could support himself financially   in New Zealand.\n\"I like New Zealand. The way of life is very much the same as it is here but it is not so crowded.\" His wife has always been \"a little bit homesick\" but has never complained. Now the couple are in the middle of the task of sorting out possessions and selling their flat.",
