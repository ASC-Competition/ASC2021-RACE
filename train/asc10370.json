  "article": "It is said that in the United States much has been told about that anyone can become rich and successful if he works hard and has some good luck.\nYes, when one becomes rich he wants people to know it. And even though he does not become very rich, he wants people to think that he is. That's what \"Keeping up with the Joneses \" is about The expression was first used in 1913 by a young American called Arthur Momand looked around him and noticed that many people did things to keep up with their neighbours. He called it \"Keeping up with the Joneses\", because Jones is a very common name in the United States. \"Keeping up with the Joneses\" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's series appeared in different newspapers across the country for over 28 years.\nPeople never seem to get tired of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read \"right\" books, go to \"right\" universities and eat in \"right\" restaurants.\nEvery city has an area where people want to live because others will think better of them if they do. And there are Joneses in every city of the world. But one must get tired of trying to keep up with the Joneses, because no matter what one does, Mr Jones always seems to be ahead.",
