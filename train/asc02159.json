  "article": "Recently, online high schools in America have sparked   a debate about whether or not taxpayers' money should be used to support online education. Online schools receive the same amount of funding as all other public schools, even though they don't have to pay for rent or school equipment. States should use their educational funds to improve education at real schools, not to support online programs.\nSome students only use online classes to supplement their school work. They benefit from the social experience of a traditional high school, while still taking online courses.\nHowever, about 90 thousand students in America receive their education only from online schools. 50 thousand of these students take courses at Florida Virtual School, the largest online school in the country. While this method of schooling helps students who live in remote regions, most school systems are upset that they are losing more students each year to these online programs.\nAlthough online learning allows children to work at their own pace, these online schools have only one teacher per several hundred students. Often, teachers can't give struggling students the help they need as they are unable to talk face-to-face with them, to find exactly what they're having difficulty with.\nAdditionally, even though online schooling accommodates   students who live in more remote states, students in online programs may suffer in social situations because they will not learn valuable communication skills from their schooling. Similar to students who are home schooled, those who take only online classes won't learn social etiquette  , and will be treated differently by their peers.\nOnline schooling might be useful for places where there are not enough students for a real school, such as agricultural regions, but states should only spend taxpayers' money on online schools in extreme cases.",
