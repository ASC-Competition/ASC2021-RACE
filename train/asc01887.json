  "article": "Windows 8, apart from Windows 95, is the biggest surprise and the only version of Microsoft' s operating system that has been changed from the core when compared to its former one. However, a recent study has shown that under 20% of business owners would be willing to upgrade to the new version of Windows. The reason for this remains to be discussed and debated, and we will try to throw light on this research by providing you with some of the most common advantages and disadvantages of Windows 8.\nGenerally speaking, there are a great number of plus sides related to upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8.\nSpeed -- This is the biggest advantage to mention. Boot time has been reported to be up to nine times shorter than that with Windows 7.\nNew passwords -- Instead of typing your passwords, Windows 8 will let you use gestures on your favorite photos to enter your password. This is not only practical but also extremely cool!\nWindows 8 experience -- Apart from computers, Windows 8 will be used on all devices, including smart phones, tablet PC's and so on. Also, owing to the fact that it has been specifically designed with touch screen users in mind, Windows 8, besides using keyboard and mouse, will offer a whole new user experience.\nHowever, there are still some disadvantages.\nThe first one that has to be mentioned is that there is no Start Menu from Windows. Yes, there is no Start button in the lower left corner, and this might be a real puzzle of many Windows users. Also, many users have had a problem to get used to the new interface introduced by Windows 8. The biggest problem that is worth noticing is that Windows 8 was originally designed for touch screen users, and this may have a bad effect on desktop users who have gotten used to doing everything with the help of their keyboard and mouse.",
