  "article": "When 7-year-old Warren Buffet said \" I will be the richest man one day\", his friends made fun of his \"daydreaming\". But ever since then the little boy has set about learning how to make money, selling drinks, delivering newspapers and buying stocks. He had already earned $ 9,000 ( equal to $ 90,000 today) by the time he graduated from high school and became a millionaire at 32.\nAnd this month the 77-year- old, who earned his fortune by making a lot of great investment in the stock market, made his childhood dream come true. With a fortune of $ 62billion, Buffet has risen to be the world's richest man according toForbes Magazine.\nBorn in 1930, Buffet, the only son of a stockbroker, started on achieving his billion-dollar dream at an early age and was always ready to think outside the box to develop his business. At 8 he went to golf courses collecting and selling used balls.\nAt 11 when he sold soda pop door to door with a friend, the pair collected lids on the streets to judge which flavor was the most popular.\nAs a paper boy during high school, Buffet delivered two rival  papers, so that even when customers canceled one of the subscriptions, he could still make a profit from the other. With his paper delivery savings, Buffet bought 162,000 square meters of farmland and collect rent.\nYoung Buffet stepped into the stock market at 11 but earned only $ 5. The experience taught him one of the virtues   in investing: patience.\nAfter graduating from university, Buffet started his venture with stocks with his childhood earnings and money from friends. He researched the stocks and just bought those of solid companies that were undervalued and inexpensive at the time. By sticking to companies such as American Express and Coca-cola, Buffet has become rich.\n\"Learning is important to Buffet's success. He is a learning machine who can spend his entire day reading. He keeps learning, from books, street smarts and investigation, from both success and failure. In this way, he finally over achieved his aptitude ( ) ,\" said Charlie Munger, his long-time business partner.",
