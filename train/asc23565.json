  "article": "I will never forget the year when I was 12.My mother told us that we would not get Christmas gifts because there was not enough money .I felt sad and thought, \"What shall I say when the other kids ask me about my gifts?\" I started to hope the Christmas wouldn't come that year. Just then three women came to our house with gifts for all of us. For me,they brought a doll .I felt so happy.\nYears later, my life changed a lot. So one Christmas, I wanted to do something special. I asked forty friends to help me. We visited 125 orphans to come to our Christmas party. For every child, we prepared a beautiful gift.\nFinally the moment came. I called out,\" One, two, three. Open your gifts!\" As the children opened their boxes, the whole room was full of their bright smiles. The feeling I got from that Christmas so long ago came again.",
