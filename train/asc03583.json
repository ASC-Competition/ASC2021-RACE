  "article": "\"The child has become part of the management of family life, \"says Adele Schwartz, researchdirector for Stars for Kids, a children's market---research firm.  \"This is a big role change in family life.  Housework is changing. It used to be to take out the garbage and walk the dog. This is a little bit bigger than that.\"\nThree---quarters of students between the ages of 8 and 14 say they have completed an online transaction ,according to a national survey on May 9. Nearly one---fourth of the 6,000 young people asked say they shop with their parents' credit cards, 26 percent use gift cards, and 8 percent say they use their own credit card. Almost half say they help with electronic transactions because their parents are helpless online. One--third help because their parents don't have enough time to shop.\n\"Kids do a large amount of comparison shopping,\"Ms. Schwartz says, \"including clothing, household items, family vacations, and even large items like a car.\nAll this cyber---help \"clearly gives kids a power that they might not have had before,\"says Gary Rudman, in San Francisco. \"Parents still make the decisions, but kids have more and more effect than ever before, because they have access to information. They are more involved with the household, so they have more effect on some of the decisions.\"\nParents have different opinions about letting their children use credit cards online. Mr. Rudman says, \"Some parents are open to it, others are not for it.\" Like many parents, Mrs, Hanstein keeps a watchful eye on Jacob's Internet use.\"he loves toorder something, but it's always with our guidance. He doesn't understand that a lot of the pop--up advertisement 'You've won this!'or 'You can get this for $1.'is a scam.\"",
