  "article": "The prestigious   Peking University and Tsinghua University held graduation ceremonies on the same day this year. The presidents of the two universities delivered excellent speeches at the ceremonies as they used words, phrases or ways of expression that are very popular on the Internet currently. At the same time, graduation speeches by other university presidents were also under the spotlight for the same reason. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by students as they contained many fashionable words today, such as \"floating clouds\" ( meaning \"too small and of little importance to mention\") and \"gelivable\" (meaning \" very helpful\") . In the speeches , these university presidents recalled campus life together with students and finally moved all the audiences. They were very different from the usual run of lectures.\nMany university presidents have changed their regular manner of addressing graduation ceremonies from an advising and preaching   mode to a more fashionable and funny approach. They try to use those words popular among young people in their speeches.\nIn the past, university presidents' speeches were criticized for being too standard and lacking sentiment. Now , they quote fashionable words in their addresses, reflecting they are starting to adopt more everyday attitudes to students. The use of these new expressions has _ a heated discussion. It focuses on the question of whether university presidents should speak in an informal way at graduation ceremonies.\nSupporters agree with the new approach. They consider it good to build close ties with students by using the youth's own words. Opponents argue the new ways have no practical value or significance for education but are merely to please those leaving university.",
