  "article": "One day Daddy and I went out for a walk. On the way we saw a lot of people. We went up and had a look. Oh dear What did we see There was a donkey  in the middle of the road. It would not move. The cars and buses could not get past. Then a policeman came. \"Whose donkey is this\" he asked. \"Its mine\" said a farmer \"but I cant move it.\" The policeman and the farmer did their best to move the donkey but it would not move. We laughed but the drivers of cars and buses were worried. \"We cant move the donkey\" the farmer and the policeman said.\"What shall we do?\"\"Give him a carrot\" my father said. \"That's a good idea\" said the farmer. Soon he found a carrot and showed it to the donkey. When the donkey saw the carrot it jumped up and walked after the farmer. All the cars and buses could get past at last",
