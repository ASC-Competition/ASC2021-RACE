  "article": "Holding doors open, picking up rubbish, thanking people ... these acts of kindness seem very small. But students at Tibbett Middle School know that it's the small acts that make the world a better place.\nEighth-graders from New Mexico, US, took part in the Random   Acts of Kindness Week from Feb 10 to 14. During the week, they tried their best to do kind things for others, or for the environment.\nCeleste Murray, an English teacher at the school, started the activity. \"I believe the world is changed by little things,\" she told the local newspaper. Over the week, Murray said she has seen changes in her class. Previously, she asked her students to push the chairs in after class. Now, the students do it by themselves. \"The teachers will have less work,\" said Elisa Castaneda, one of Murray's students.\nJordan Marshall, another eighth-grader, spent the week giving out praise  . \"It makes that person's day  ,\" she said. \"Besides helping others, the activity made students feel that they can make a difference,\" Murray said.\nEighth-grader Haley Echols decided to continue to do at least one act of kindness every week. She believes her acts could encourage others.",
