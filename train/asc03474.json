  "article": "A man came home from work and found his three children outside, still in their pajamas  playing in the mud,with empty food boxes and wrappers thrown all around the front yard.\nThe door of his wife's car was open,as was the front door to the house and there was no sign of the dog.\nWalking into the entry,he found an even bigger mess. A lamp had been knocked over. In the front room the TV was loudly blaring a cartoon channel,and the family room was thrown with toys and various items of clothing.\nIn the kitchen,dishes filled the sink,breakfast food was spilled on the counter,the fridge door was open wide, dog food was spilled on the floor,a broken glass lay under the table,and a small pile of sand was spread by the back door.\nHe quickly headed up the stairs,stepping over toys and more piles of clothes,looking for his wife. He was worried she might be ill,or that something serious had happened. He was met with a small drop of water as it made its way out the bathroom door. As he looked inside he found wet towels, soap and more toys thrown over the floor. Miles of toilet paper lay in a heap  and toothpaste had been put over the mirror and walls.\nAs he rushed to the bedroom, he found his wife still sleeping in the bed in her pajamas,reading a novel. She looked up at him,smiled,and asked how his day went. He looked at her puzzled and asked, \"What happened here today?\"\nShe again smiled and answered,\"You know every day when you come home from work and ask me what in the world I did today?\"\n\"Yes,\" was his reply.\nShe answered,\"Well,today I didn't do it.\"",
