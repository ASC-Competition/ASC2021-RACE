  "article": "Most of us long for relationships in which we are loved and accepted. Our hearts' desire is to give and receive love in relationships that make us feel that even if others disagree with what we do or say, they still love us, accept us, and appreciate what we give to the world. While it would be wonderful to have these types of relationships with all people, we know that's hard to do. However, we can have such relationships with some others, but only when we first have them with ourselves--and, strangely, this is often the hardest relationship of all.\nDo you love yourself? You may think you do, but do you really? There's only one way to find out-- by taking a close look at what you think, say, and do. You may not like some of what you find, but if you are serious about really loving yourself, you can use this insight to do some positive inner work. Here're three ways for gaining greater personal insight for deeper love:\nListen Closely to Your Thoughts\nYour thoughts will determine your actions. One thing helping you to listen to your thoughts is keeping a journal. It is not necessary for you to write in it every day, but it helps to record various insights you gain as you go about your life. Instead of using a big notebook, you might use a small notepad that you can keep in your pocket for easy access to record your thoughts as they occur to you. Whichever method you choose, what's most important is that you write your thoughts down. It will help you know what's in your heart.\nBe Honest with Yourself\nTo do this, you should pay attention to your actions. Actions speak louder than words, and they always tell the truth. If you say you love your job, but your actions say otherwise, which do you think is more reliable? On the other hand, if you say you're not good at a certain job, but your actions say otherwise, that's also important. What do you do with this insight? You can use it to make more positive choices in your life. By being honest with yourself, you will act according to truth instead of just what you tell yourself.\nTake Quiet Time to Listen to Your Inner Voice\nThis is similar to the first point, but it takes a step further-- beyond the natural mind to the heart that cannot be seen. You may want to use your quiet time to think deeply. However you use this time, the key is to shut out all of the noise around you by focusing deep within yourself. Breathing deeply during quiet time will also help you focus. I know it's hard to find quiet time during a particularly busy day, but it's so important-- even if it's just 10 minutes a day and you have to hide somewhere to get it. Quiet time can really make a difference in your life.\nDespite what your mind may be telling you, you can have love with no limits. The key is to unconditionally love yourself first.",
