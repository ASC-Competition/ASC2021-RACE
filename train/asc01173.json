  "article": "As a music teacher for twenty-seven years, I have always known that music touches the soul. It can break through all kinds of barriers  to reach students in a very special way. It can be the means for each child to find their light.\nA few years ago, I was blessed with the opportunity to teach pre-school students one afternoon a week. One of my most memorable students was Vanessa. She was five years old, had difficulty walking, and could not speak. We mostly sat on the floor for our music lessons and Vanessa liked to sit on my lap. One of her favorite songs was John the Rabbit. It was a call and response song where I sang the call and the students clapped two times while singing the repeating phrase, \"Oh, yes!\" Vanessa liked to put her hands together with mine and clap with me. We performed that song during every class, Vanessa and I clapping together. She never said or sang a word.\nOne day late in the school year, when the song was finished, Vanessa turned around, looked me in the eye, clapped her tiny hands two times and said the words \"Oh, yes!\" I opened my mouth and could not speak. Through music, we had made a connection.\nSeveral years later, I came across Vanessa on the street in town. I stopped my car and waved to say hello. She waved back with a big smile on her face and then clapped her hands two times, mimicking  the song we had performed in our music class. This precious little girl, through her connection with music, left an impression on me that will last forever.\nEvery child has the ability to learn and grow. It is up to us educators to discover the way to reach each and every one of our students. We all must find each child's light.",
