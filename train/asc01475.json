  "article": "Nine out of 10 people have run up unsecured debt and many fear they will never be able to pay back what they owe, a survey has claimed.\nAround 89% of people aged between l|8 and 35 said they owed money on a credit card, loan or overdraft, the research showed.\nA third of people admitted they did not think- they would ever be debt-free, 54% of whom said they would always need to borrow money in order to fund the lifestyle they wanted.\nOne in five of these people also claimed they were not worried about the possibility of their debts being passed on to their next of kin if they died before they were repaid.\nJust over half who owed money said they did not feel in control of their debt, with 8% admitting they had needed to ask for help with repayments from a friend or family member.Eight out of 10 people also told the research for discount website MyVoucherCodes.co.uk that they thought it was too easy to borrow money through their bank or on credit cards.\nFarhad Farhadi, MyVoucherCodes.co.uk's personal finance expert, said: \"The majority of British adults owe money m some way, shape or form, but to see that almost a third think they'll never be free c ^ from debt is quite alarming.\n\"When borrowing money from any source, how you are going to repay it should always be in the back of your mind.\n\"A lot of people don't-really think about 'die consequences of borrowing money and it can be easy to get complacent, but keeping it all under control should be a priority _ .Only borrow what you really think you can afford to pay back.\"",
