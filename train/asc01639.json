  "article": "Leave a camera on a mountaintop, and chances are, you'll never see it again. But 24-year-old Paul Bellis, a university student from Wales, believed that most people were better than that, and set up a creative experiment to test out his theory.\n\"I was speaking to a friend who said you can't trust anyone, anywhere these days,\" Bellis toldthe Daily Mail. \"I didn't want to believe _ so I set up this experiment to find out what might happen and prove you can trust people.\"\nBillis decided to do an experiment by hiking up a mountain called Snowdonia, taking a photo, and leaving his camera behind. He also attached a note to the camera, asking other hikers to take photos of themselves and then leave the camera there until the roll of film   was empty. He also included his address, in case someone would be nice enough to return the camera to his home after the roll of film was finished.\nFour days later, Bellis got a visit from a Snowdonia park manager, who came to return his camera. After Bellis got the film developed, he saw that his fellow hikers and followed his instructions. Thirty people had each taken photos of themselves at the mountain. From viewing the collection, it was clear that all the hikers had enjoyed the experiment.\nAs for the park manager, Brian, \"I found the camera and thought it had been lost until I saw the note,\" he said. \"I was passing his home and just dropped it off. I' m glad that the photos came out very well.\"",
