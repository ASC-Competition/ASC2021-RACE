    "When sea turtles are nesting, probably   _  ."

  "article": "There are plenty of reasons that have put sea turtles in danger. Here are some.\nThe sea turtles tend to live in water, but the females come over to lands for nesting. This is the time when they are in the most vulnerable   position. Their nesting areas have been taken over by human settlements and recreation development. This has forced them to search for areas that are less suitable for nesting.\nThe egg is the first step for a sea turtle to have a chance of life. And this first step of life has become vulnerable in many countries. The sea turtles have no way to protect their eggs. As a result, the poachers   have an opportunity to steal their eggs.\nThe sea turtles are caught in shrimping vessels   that use nets. The nets can drown these poor creatures. They die, as the nets are not pulled out fast. Gill nets and drilling for oil also _ habitat destruction and injury to the animal.\nOne female sea turtle can lay hundreds of eggs in one nesting season. These eggs are preyed on by crabs  , foxes, birds, and humans, as they make their run towards the sea. By the time they reach the shallow water, half of them have been removed by their predators   on land and some are eaten up by fish in water. Only a few lucky ones win the battle of survival and live past their 1st birthday!\nThe sea turtles take more than a decade to reach maturity. Then they start breeding and adult turtles have to live for many years to maintain the balance of population. However, as mentioned above, the adults face a lot of hardships for surviving. Pollution, long lines of fishing fleets, high seas, and even tumors, etc., all cause death of these massive, beautiful species.",
