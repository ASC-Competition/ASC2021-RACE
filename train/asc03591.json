  "article": "More and more Americans are showing an interest in healthy and locally-produced food. As the interest increases, raising chickens has been gaining popularity in some American cities.\n\"Look, we get three eggs this time.\"\nCollecting eggs is a daily pleasure for the Hurst family. Naomi Hurst says her family started to raise chickens in back of their home in Maryland a month ago.\n\"We have wanted to try having backyard chickens for a couple years now. And really just didn't have the time to build my own coop(;) and look out where to buy chickens. And then we met Rent a Coop,\" said Naomi Hurst.\nRent a Coop is a chicken rental business. Tyler Phillips launched the company with a partner 18 months ago. It comes with a mobile coop on wheels, two egg-laying hens, feed, bedding, water bowl, feed bowl, and our 24-hour chicken hotline. You can call with any questions. The price is 185 dollars for four weeks.\nAfter the four weeks passed, individuals can extend the rental agreement, return everything or purchase the animals and supplies.\nTyler Phillips designs and makes the coops. He says he wants to do as little damage as possible to the environment.\n\"We always try to have as many recycled materials as possible. And I want the coops to be safe for kids. I want the chickens to be comfortable and they have access to the grass while being inside the coop. I want it to be easily movable, light weight,\" he said.\nSome cities require people have large pieces of land, if they want to raise farm animals. Others require an agreement with neighbors, limit the number of chickens, or, even ban the birds.\nTyler Phillips expects that would change as interest in small poultry   coops grows.\n\"I see cities around the D. C. area changing laws almost monthly and different cities will change the law to being prochicken . That is happening all around the United States,\" he said, He believes that there will be chicken rental businesses in most American cities within five years.",
