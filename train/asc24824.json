  "article": "Nat lived in a small town in England. He always stayed in England for his vacation, but last year he thought, \"I'm never outside this country. All my friends go to Spain , and they like it very much. So this year I'm going there, too.\"\nFirst he went to Madrid   and stayed in a small hotel for a few days. On the first morning he went out for a walk. In England people drive on the left, but in Spain they drive on the right. Nat forgot about this and when he was crossing a busy street, a bike knocked   him down.\nNat lay   on the ground for a few seconds and then he sat up and said,\n\"Where am I ?\"\nAn old man was selling maps at the side of the street, and he at once came\nto Nat and said, \"Map of the city, sir ?\"",
