  "article": "Long long ago, there lived in England a king named Midas. He was a greedy  man and loved gold  better than anything else in the world.\nOne day, he asked a god to give him more gold. The god decided to punish him and said, \"Your wish is _ already. Everything you touch will turn to gold.\"\nMidas was very happy when he heard this. The next morning, he got up early to test his skills. When he touched his bed, it turned to gold. \"Gold!\" cried Midas, laughing like a little boy, \"It works.\"\nNot only stones, flowers, and the furniture in his house turned to gold, but, when he sat down to table, so did the food he ate and the water he drank. He was unhappy now. Just then his daughter ran up to him. Midas touched her hand. At once she became a gold statue !\nA last, he begged the god to free him from his wish. \"Go to the river and bathe in it.\" said the god. So Midas did, and the water took away his golden touch.",
