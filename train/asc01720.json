  "article": "The health and welfare of every person in America will be affected by global warming, especially children, the elderly and the poor, according to a new White House science report.\nThe report said every region   of the country will suffer worse health from heat waves and drought. _ It predicts an increase in diseases spread by tainted   food, bad water and bugs  .\nThe report concludes that climate change causes real risk to human health and human system that supports the way of life in the United States.\nMan-made global warming is caused by greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels. At current emission   levels, global temperatures are likely to rise by about 2 degrees by midcentury and about 7.5 degrees by the end of the century.\nThe most vulnerable   Americans -- the poor, elderly, sick, very young and immigrants -- will suffer more. That's at least 10 percent of the country's population, probably more. It will be tougher for these people to get enough health care for climate-related illnesses, to cool down in heat waves, to escape extreme events such as Hurricane Katrina, and even to get enough food.\nWhile every region of America is vulnerable to global warming's health and welfare effects, more people are moving to coastal regions, which are most vulnerable to climate change because of drought and hurricanes.",
