List what you already know like the sentences below:\n(1)Dinosaurs lived long before human beings appeared.\n(2)Dinosaurs lived on the earth for more than 150 million years.\n(3)Some dinosaurs fed on plants, some on meat.\nStep 3\nWhat can you do with what you want to learn? By asking questions. On your paper,start writing down questions about the dinosaurs as you think of them:\n(1)What's the best weather for dinosaurs to live in?\n(2)How many kinds of dinosaurs are there?\n(3)Have dinosaurs really disappeared?\nStep 4\nArmed with your list of questions, you can now go to the nearest library or computer to begin your research.
