  "article": "There is one word that is on the lips of Americans , day and night , \"Sorry\".\nOne time as I was walking on the street , a young man ran by hurriedly , brushing against my handbag . Even as he continued on his way , he turned back and said \"sorry\" to me . Even in a rush , he didn't forget to apologize .\nOne day , after I bought some apples , the salesman was giving me the change , but I wasn't ready for it , and a coin dropped on the ground, \"I'm sorry ,\" he said while bending down to pick it up . I was puzzled --why would he apologize when it was my fault ?\nAnother time , I stepped on a man's foot in an escalator . At the same time , we both said \"sorry\" . I thought it interesting : was it really necessary for him apologize ?\nLater on , an American friend explained to me that according to the American ideas, the escalator is public place which everyone should be able to stand in . After someone occupies a position in the escalator , making it difficult for someone else to find a place to stand in , isn't it necessary to express an apology ?\nDuring my stay in America , I gradually realized that when friction   occurs in daily life , Americans don't care much about who is responsible . If someone is troubled , a \"sorry\" is always necessary . Even if the other person is hurt , the \"sorry\" would cool tempers . Perhaps this is why I never saw anyone quarreling on the buses , subways or streets in America .",
