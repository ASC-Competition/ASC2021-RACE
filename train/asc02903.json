  "article": "If you need to spend time on the road,it's important to find ways to keep safe on your feet. Don't suppose it's your right of way. Yes, you might be crossing at the right place, at the right time, within the crosswalk area, but you are still exposed to danger. It could be a distracted driver, or a cyclist with a loose sense of traffic rules, so you could still get hurt. You can be in the right legally, but that won't be much help when you're in the hospital.\nFollow pedestrian signals. Just as drivers aren't supposed to speed up to beat a light when crossing through an intersection, pedestrians need to take the same care when obeying their own signals. If the hand is flashing and the countdown is into single digits  ,stay where you are. Trying to outrun the flashing hand is unsafe,especially as cars try to clear the intersection before the light turns red.\nGive drivers enough time to stop when crossing. Don't suppose that drivers will jam on their brakes when you hit the crosswalk signals. Some provinces, such as Alberta, issue  a ticket if you don't give drivers enough time to brake.\nCross quickly. Once you've followed all of the other rules, and it is safe to cross the street, don't then just wander along in front of six lanes  of traffic. There's no need to run or jog, but respect the drivers who respected you enough to stop for you.",
