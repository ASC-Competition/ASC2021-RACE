  "article": "On the first day of college our professor introduced himself and challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know.\nI stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being. She said, \"Hi, handsome! My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old. Can I give you a hug?\" I laughed and enthusiastically responded, \"Of course you can!\" and she gave me a giant squeeze.\n\"Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?\" I asked. She jokingly replied, \"I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel.\"\n\"No seriously,\" I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to be taking on this challenge at her age. \"I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting one!\" she told me.\nAfter class we walked to the student union building and shared a chocolate milkshake. We instantly became friends. Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk non-stop.\nI was always mesmerized  listening to this \"time machine\" as she shared her wisdom and experience with me. Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon  and she easily made friends wherever she went.\nAt the year end, Rose finished the degree she had begun all those years ago. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over two thousand college students attended her funeral to pay their respects to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it's never too late to be all you can possible be.",
