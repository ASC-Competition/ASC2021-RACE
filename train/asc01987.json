  "article": "Waiting anxiously to be reunited with the son he had not seen for 13 years, Phil Baker took a walk along the beach with his wife Lyn to relax himself. His boy Benji, 21, was finally back to Australia after living most of his life in the UK, half a world away from his dad.\nAs he looked out at the ocean, wondering how his son might have changed over the years, Phil saw some people on the kayaks   in trouble on the water. Without hesitation, he dived into the sea to help. And as he carried a stricken young man trembling and semi-conscious to the shore, he realized the young man was his long-lost son.\n\"I looked at his face, and something occurred to me,\" says Phil. \"Those brown eyes were very familiar.\" Although Phil had seen just a few photos of his son since the boy was eight years old, he recognized him at once.\nIt would be reasonable to suppose it was a father's instinct that _ Phil to help ---- but at the moment he dived into the water to go to the aid of the struggling group, he only thought he was helping a stranger in trouble.\nHe said, \"Two people were desperately paddling on one of the kayaks and it seemed like someone fell into the water. I told Lyn, 'Something is not right; I'm going to help.' \"\n\"l took off my T-shirt and threw my keys on the sand. Diving into the water, I saw there were two instructors on board and a man lying in the water. He was shaking violently. Linking arms with one instructor, I helped to carry the man out of the water. He was drifting in and out of consciousness and his hands and feet were blue.\"\nThen Phil looked into the boy's eyes and wept as he realized the stricken stranger was his own son. Phil recalled, \"I asked the instructor, 'what's his name?' \" He replied, 'Benji'. In an instant, I knew that stranger was my boy. I checked his breathing and pulse and said, \"It's me, your dad. You're going to be OK.\"\nBenji tells how it felt to be saved by his long-lost dad. \"All I remember was waking up on the beach and seeing my dad there,\" he says, \"And I recognized his face straight away.\"",
