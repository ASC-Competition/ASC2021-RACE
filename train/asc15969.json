  "article": "\"Can't hold a candle to\" is a popular expression.When there wasn't electricity, someone would have a servant light his way by holding a candle.The expression meant that the person who cannot hold a candle to you is not fit even to be your servant.Now,it means such a person cannot compare or compete.\nAnother expression is\"hold your tongue.\"It means to be still and not talk.\"Hold your tongue\"is not something you would tell a friend.But a parent or teacher might use the expression to quiet a noisy child.\n\"Hold out\"is an expression one hears often in sports reports and labor news.It means to refuse to play or work.Professional football and baseball players\"hold out\" if their team refuses to pay them what they think they are worth.\nThe expression\"hold up\" has several different meanings.One is a robbery.A man with a gun may say,\"This is a hold up.Give me your money.\"Another meaning is to delay.A driver who was held up by heavy traffic might be late for work.Another meaning is for a story to be considered true after an investigation.A story can hold up if it is proved true.\n\"Hold on\"is another expression,which means wait or stop.As you leave for school,your brother may say,\"Hold on,you forgot your book.\" It is used to ask a telephone caller to wait and not hang up his telephone.\nOur final expression is\"hold the line.\"That means to keep a problem or situation from getting worse--to hold steady.For example,the president may say he will\"hold the line on taxes.\"He means there will be no increase in taxes.",
