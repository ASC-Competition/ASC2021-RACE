  "article": "Spending time with your kids is the best way to give them you attention. No matter whether you stay at home or work outside the home, you can still give quality time to your kids. Quality time doesn't mean the whole family sitting for four hours watching TV. It means turning the TV off and playing games together, reading books, going for walks---anything!\nGiving kids your attention means listening to them when they talk. I don't mean half-way listening and saying \"uh huh\" like we do to our spouses   when they're talking about their day at work. I mean sitting down, looking children in the eye, and listening. Ask questions. Be interested. It shows that you're paying attention, even if your question is just, \"So you say you painted the cat blue?\"\nRaising kids is not the time to be selfish with your time. You can be selfish later on when they're grown and having kids of their own. If you feel guilty about not being able to spend enough time with your kids, resist trying to buy their attention. You don't have to make every weekend a Disneyland day. And you don't have to continually buy them gifts as a means of letting them know you love them. The answer is \"time\". Time is what they want most from you.\nYour kids, no matter what age, are on some type of schedule. They get up, eat breakfast, eat lunch, eat dinner, etc. What do they do the rest of the time? Fill up some of the empty spots in their schedules with activities. Have them help you do something around the house or make them take part in a project with you. This is how day care workers are able to keep so many kids under control---they fill up the day with activities.",
