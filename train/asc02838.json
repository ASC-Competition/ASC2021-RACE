When the waiter came up, he opened his mouth, put his finger in his mouth and took it out. He wanted to showed, \"Bring me something to eat.\"\nThe waiter soon brought him a cup of tea. The man shook his head and put his finger in and out of his mouth again. The waiter understood him and took the tea away. In a moment he came back with a cup of coffee. But the man refused it. He shook his head again and again whenever the waiter brought him something to drink, for drinks were not food.\nWhen the Frenchman was going away, he saw another foreigner came in.
