  "article": "Papa, as a son of a dirt-poor farmer, left school early and went to work in a factory, for education was for the rich then. So, the world became his school. With great interest, he read everything he could lay his hands on, listened to the town elders and learned about the world beyond his tiny hometown. \"There's so much to learn,\" he'd say. \"Though we're born stupid, only the stupid remain that way. \" He was determined that none of his children would be denied an education.\nThus, Papa insisted that we learn at least one new thing each day. Though, as children, we thought this was crazy, it would never have occurred to us to deny Papa a request. And dinner time seemed perfect for sharing what we had learned. We would talk about the news of the day; no matter how insignificant, it was never taken lightly. Papa would listen carefully and was ready with some comment, always to the point.\nThen came the moment--the time to share the day's new learning.\nPapa, at the head of the table, would push back his chair and pour a glass of red wine, ready to listen.\n\"Felice,\" he'd say, \"tell me what you learned today. \"\n\"I learned that the population of Nepal is .... \"\nSilence.\nPapa was thinking about what was said, as if the salvation of the world would depend upon it. \"The population of Nepal. Hmm. Well . . . . \" he'd say. \"Get the map; let's see where Nepal is. \" And the whole family\nwent on a search for Nepal.\nThis same experience was repeated until each family member had a turn. Dinner ended only after we had a clear understanding of at least half a dozen such facts.\nAs children, we thought very little about these educational wonders. Our family, however, was growing together, sharing experiences and participating in one another's education. And by looking at us, listening to us, respecting our input, affirming our value, giving us a sense of dignity, Papa was unquestionably our most influential teacher.\nLater during my training as a future teacher /1 studied with some of the most famous educators. They were imparting what Papa had known all along--the value of continual learning. His technique has served me well all my life. Not a single day has been wasted, though I can never tell when knowing the population of Nepal might prove useful.",
