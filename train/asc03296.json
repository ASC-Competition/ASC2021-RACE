  "article": "One day,I noticed the most beautiful Cadillac pull in the lot while waiting for my husband.A pretty female driver pulled into the spot beside our car.There was a striking resemblance to Liz Taylor.Her eyes were as blue as the sea,and teeth like an even row of pearls.A few minutes 1ater,a nice looking man entered her car,leaned over and kissed her and she drove away.\nSitting there,I wanted to cry.How could some people have it all?\nThen it became almost routine to see her about once a week.She seemed friendly and always waved,flashing a big smile.My envy continued to exist long after she drove away.\nA couple of weeks later,sitting in our usual parking lot,I was holding a book,watching her over the top of it.Her husband came to the car,took her arm and helped her out of the car.I could see very well as she moved to get out.She unsteadily walked around to the passenger side very slowly, leaning on a walking cane.Sitting sideways.she lifted one leg with her hands and then the other.The beautiful lady had a prosthesis  on the left Ieg and a brace  on the right leg.\nI couldn't watch them drive away as the tears were blinding me.Through my tears,I told my husband about the beautiful lady.He said he knew her husband and the story.The lady and her parents were in a car that got caught on the railroad tracks and was hit by a train.Both parents were killed and she was severely injured.She was only 12 years old.The railroad made a large settlement with her because the crossing had no signals.He explained her car was specially built for her needs as well as the home.\nI prayed for forgiveness all the way home.The lady I thought had everything I didn't.I realized how lucky I was to have my parents,the ability to walk,run or dance through life and many wonderful things money can't buy.I would not have traded places with the beautiful lady for anything.\nWhen you meet a person who seems to be much better off than you,don't be fooled.",
