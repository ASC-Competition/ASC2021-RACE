  "article": "\"USA? Britain? Which country is better to study in?\" We often hear such discussions. As China opens its doors, studying abroad has become a dream for many Chinese students. They want to learn about the world.\nIt's true that studying abroad can help students develop themselves. Language skills will improve and it may be easier to find jobs.\nBut there are problems that should be considered. Language is the first. Students must spend a lot of time learning another language and getting used to a different culture.\nStudents must also learn to live without parents' care and deal with all kinds of things they haven't had to do before, like looking after themselves. There are reports about Chinese students abroad sinking into an ocean of difficulties and giving up easily. When they have to take care of themselves, it is hard for students to study well.\nFinally, studying abroad brings a heavy burden  to the family. For most Chinese parents, the cost of studying abroad is very high. But is it worth it?\nWe know that there are many famous people who succeed in great things through their hard work in China. Liu Xiang is a good example. Once an American teacher invited him there but he refused. He kept training hard with his Chinese teacher. He surprised the world when he won a gold medal at the Athens Olympics. So when you wonder which country is better to study in, consider whether studying abroad is the right choice.",
