  "article": "Mr. and Mrs. Green lived in a big city, and one summer they went to the country for their holiday. They enjoyed it very much, because it was a quiet, clean place.\nOne day they went for a walk early in the morning and met an old man. He lived on a farm, and he was sitting in the warm sun in front of his house. Mr. Green asked him, \"Do you like to live in this quiet place?\"\nThe old man said, \"Yes, I do,\" Mr. Green said, \"What are the good things about it?\"\nThe old man answered, \"Well, the people here know each other. They often come and visit me, and I often go and visit them. And there are also lots of children here.\"\nMr. Green said, \"That's interesting. And what are the bad things?\"\nThe old man thought and thought and then said, \"Well, the same things, are they?\"",
