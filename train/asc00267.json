  "article": "For decades,the San Francisco Bay area has been the heart of the computer technology industry.Many of the biggest technology companies have their headquarters in the area called Silicon Valley.But the area has not always been associated with charity .\nNow,a new generation of entrepreneurs appears to be changing Silicon Valley.One example is Marc Benioff,a donor ,who has called on wealthy donors to give more to their communities.He also is the founder of Salesforce.com,a computer services company in San Francisco who has helped build a children's hospital and given millions of dollars to non-profit organizations in the city.\nMoney from the technology industry has also started to change the face of charity.Benjamin Soskis writes about the history and ideas behind charity in America.His articles have appeared in The Atlantic magazine and a number of major publications.He says,traditionally,donors have given after they spent much of their lives building up wealth.Usually donors are in their 70s.But an increasing number of people appearing on the list of top donors are younger than 40 years of age.Benjamin Soskis says that is something new.\"There's a whole new model that's appearing in which people give and accumulate at the same time.\"\nSome of the young donors on this year's top 50 list have started to change in the way people see charity.That is especially the case in the San Francisco area,where giving money and making money appear to be coming together.\"I think it's fair to say that charity is now a part of the Silicon Valley identity.\"",
