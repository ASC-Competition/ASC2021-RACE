  "article": "A few years ago a group of salesmen went to a meeting in Chicago. They had assured their wives that they would be home in plenty of time for Friday night's dinner. In their rush, with tickets, one of these salesmen happened to kick over a table which held a display of baskets of apples. Apples flew everywhere. Without stopping or looking back, they all managed to reach the plane in time for their boarding.\nAll but one stopped, took a deep breath and experienced a twinge of sorrow for the girl whose apple stand had been overturned. He told his friends to go on without him, waved goodbye, and told one of them to call his wife when they arrived and explain his taking a later flight. Then he returned to where the apple stand had been overturned. He was glad he did.\nThe 16-year-old girl was totally blind! She was softly crying, tears running down her face. The salesman knelt on the floor with her, gathered up the apples, put them into the baskets, and helped set the display up once more. As he did this, he noticed that many of them had become damaged; then he set them aside in another basket. When he had finished, he pulled out his wallet and said to the girl, \"Here, please take the $20 for the damage we did.\" He continued, \"I'm sorry for what we did and hope we didn't spoil your day too badly.\"\nShe nodded with her tears. As the salesman started to walk away, the blind girl called out to him, \"Mr. ...\". He stopped, and turned back. She continued, \"Thank you very much\".",
