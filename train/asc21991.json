Regular listeners know that every Tuesday I give a list of places in the city that are looking for volunteers.\nTiny Tot Preschool is looking for someone who will sing songs to the children on Thursday mornings. The best person for this job would be someone who can play the piano or the guitar.\nPrimary School 39 needs volunteers to teach students English after school on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.If you are good at English,this is a great chace.\nThe Parks Department needs volunteers to help plant many trees before May Day. If you like to work outside and protect the environment, this job is just for you.\nLastly, the Community Center is looking for volunteers to work with old people on weekends. You can help read newspapers to the old people with bad eyesight. The Center also needs a few students to do fix-up work on houses.
