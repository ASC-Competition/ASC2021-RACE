  "article": "Susan Boyle was just an ordinary middle-aged British woman before she appeared on the reality show .\nShe lives in a house with her cat Pebbles in a tiny Scottish town. Because of learning difficulties, she doesn't have much education. But what she does have is a very good voice. As a kid, she sang in church and school plays. For a living, she sang at local pubs.\nWhen she took the stage on April 10th, her hair was untidy and her clothes seemed _ rags .The audience laughed at her.\nBut then she opened her mouth. A few bars into the song and the laughing audience went silent. A beautiful voice was singing I Dreamed a Dream from the musical Les Miserables. Everyone was amazed. At the end of the song, the audience jumped to their feet and applauded wildly.\nAlmost overnight, Susan became a household name. She won fans and millions of admirers. Her online videos have drawn over 85.2 million hits.\nSusan's story proved the truth of an old saying: \"Never judge a book by its cover.\"",
