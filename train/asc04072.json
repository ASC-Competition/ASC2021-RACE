  "article": "Scientists in Argentina have created the world's first cow to own two human genes that will enable it to produce human-like milk, which is matchless up to now. It is a breakthrough in the area of clone.\nGenetic engineering was used to introduce the \"mothers' milk\" genes into the animal before birth, according to the National Institute of Agribusiness Technology in Buenos Aires.\nAs an adult, the cloned cow \"will produce milk that is similar to humans\" in what will prove \"a development of great importance for the nutrition of infants\", it said in a statement.\n\"The cloned cow, named Rosita ISA, is the first one born in the world that owns two human genes that contain the proteins present in human milk,\" the statement said.\nIn April, scientists in China published details of research showing that they had created GM Holstein dairy cows which produced milk containing proteins found in human breast milk.\nBut the Argentine team says the Chinese only introduced one human gene, whereas their research involved two genes meaning the milk will more closely resemble that of humans.\nRosita ISA was born on April 6 and was delivered by Caesarean section because she weighed around 100 pounds, roughly twice the normal weight of Jersey cows.\nAdrian Mutto, from the National University of San Martin said \"Our goal was to raise nutritional value of cows' milk by adding two human genes, the protein lactoferrin and lysozyme, which can provide newly-born babies with anti-bacterial and anti-viral protection.\"\nCristina Kirchner, President of Argentina, said that the scientific institute \"makes all proud.\" She also revealed that she had rejected the \"honor\" of having the cow named after her. \"They came to tell me that the name is Cristina, but what woman would like to have a cow named after her? It appeared to me to be more appropriate to call it Rosita.\"",
