  "article": "At a meeting, a well-known speaker lifted up a bill of 20 dollars before starting his speech.\nFacing 200 people, he asked, \"Who wants this 20-dollar bill?\" A great many hands were put up. Then he continued to say, \"I intended to give it to any one of you, but allow me to do a thing before giving it to you.\" Suddenly he crumpled  it into a round mass. Then he asked, \"Who wants it? \" Still some hands were lifted up.\nHe asked again, \"Well, how could it be if I do it like this?\" he threw the bill onto the ground, stepped on it and twisted it. As he picked it up, the bill had become not only dirty but _ \n\"Who still wants it?\" Still a few people put up their hands.\n\"My dear friends, you have had a meaningful class. No matter how I treated this bill, you still want it, because it is worth 20 dollars. On your life road, you may be knocked down  or even broken into pieces by your determination  or unfavorable  situations. We may feel ourselves worth nothing, but, my darling, remember that whatever happens in the future, you should never lose your value  in the God's heart. You're particular ---- never forget it.\"",
