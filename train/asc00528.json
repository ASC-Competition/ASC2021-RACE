  "article": "In the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and preparing for the worst, Australian adventurer Peter Seiter wrote a farewell note to his family, put it in a bottle and threw it overboard. With a sense of bad feeling he wrote: \"The ocean has a personality of its own. The place can be such a peaceful environment to be in, yet it can be frightfully violent. I've experienced both.\" Fearing he wouldn't make it home, he placed the note -- dated June 11, 1998 -- in a wine bottle and covered the bottle.\n\"I included my geographical coordinates, so if anything happened to me, they'd know my last place when I threw the bottle into the ocean,\" says Peter, who was then sailing from the Azores in Portugal to New York and knew the Atlantic could be dangerous. He also included some money with his message, asking whoever found it to use the money to post the letter to his family.\nSeventeen days later he reached his destination, having survived the dangerous seas, but he assumed his message in the bottle had not -- until it was found on shore, 11 years later!\nRecently, American woman Katherine Ginn and her friend came across the bottle on a deserted beach in the Bahamas. \"Alongside it they'd found a life jacket and, assuming the worst, opened the bottle and spent 24 hours drying it out so they could read my story and write to my family as I requested,\" says Peter, 44. \"I couldn't believe it -- that after all these years my bottle had turned up with its contents, still undamaged.\"\nOverjoyed, he wrote to the pair, saying he was alive and living in Australia with his family.\nKatherine posted him his letter, money and some broken glass of his bottle placed in a tiny box as a special souvenir. These special items now share pride of place among photos of Peter's Atlantic voyage. \"I can't express what this old letter means to me,\" Peter says. \"It gives me a sense of hope and belief. It's something special to share with my children as they grow up.\"",
