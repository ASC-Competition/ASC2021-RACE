  "article": "I regularly train at a local boxing gym and I'm lucky enough to meet an amazing man, Adrian Charter. Adrian comes to the gym to train, just like me. The difference is, I'm 31 years old, and Adrian is 72!\nI watched Adrian as he was training, early on a Sunday morning, and he was hitting the punching bag harder and quicker than most men in their twenties would. Adrian was a former boxer whose last professional fight was in 1972. Even though he has stopped competing as a boxer, his discipline  still makes him stick to a training rule.\nIt simply amazed me as to how a 72-year-old man could train so hard. Believe me, boxing is one of the most difficult sports on the earth, needing much patience,skill, and effort.\nWhat surprised me even more was that a few days earlier he did some running. He ran 9 kilometers. He does this on a regular basis. For me, I can run 5 kilometers at most.\nWhen I questioned him about how he kept such discipline, he calmly replied, \"It is all in my mind.\"\nI thought about it for a moment. If discipline can push a 72-year-old man to train so hard and enjoy it, could I imagine how discipline could serve every single human being on the earth? Right at this point, as you read this story, please pause and ask yourself, \"What is my level of discipline?\"\nAdrian's example told me that the power of discipline will get us to the finishing line! _",
