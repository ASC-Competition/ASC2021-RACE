We are going to have some new subjects. My name is Wu Ming. Wei Fang and I are in the same class. I'm not very good at Chinese, but Wei Fang says she's going to help me. I think I can do better than last year.\nI like English very much. This year I'm going to do more speaking. Zhang Hong also likes English, but he needs some help. I'm going to help him.\nThis term I'm going to work for the wall-newspaper. My classmates say I draw well. I like it, too. I'm going to do my best this year.",
