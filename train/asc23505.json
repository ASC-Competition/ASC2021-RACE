  "article": "In one way, it may be thought that failure is a part of life. In another, failure may be regarded as a step towards success.\nThe \"spider story\" is often told as an example of this. Robert Bruce, leader of the Scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a hole on a hill from the English. He watched a spider  making a web . Bruce is said to have got confidence from this and to have gone on to beat the English. Edison, too, the inventor of the light bulb , made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one.\nSo what? First, always think about your failure. What caused it? Were you in high spirit then? What can you change so that things will go right the next time?\nSecond, is the goal you are trying to reach the right one? Try to do some thinking about what your real goal may be. Think about this question: If I am successful in this, where will it get me?\" This may help to prevent failure in the things you shouldn't be doing anyway.\nThe third thing to remember about failure is that it's a part of life. Learn to \"live with yourself!\" even though you may have failed. Remember, \"You can't live with them all.\"",
