  "article": "About 12,000 years ago- long before the famous UFO crash make headlines in America--an alien spaceship crashed in China. And their descendants are still living in a faraway Chinese village today! That is the mind-bending claim made in the new book Out of Time and Place, a collection of reports from the files of Fate, a magazine edited by Terry O'Neil.\nThe story first came to light in 1937 when an expedition led by Chi Pu-Tei came across a group of caves deep in the Bayan-Kara-Ula Mountains. In the caves were found strange-looking skeletons with big heads and small, slender bodies--closely matching typical descriptions of space aliens. The explorers also uncovered 716 mysterious stone discs with strange hieroglyphics  on them.\nIn Qinghai Province, where the mountains lie, ancient stories tell of small, skinny beings with oversize heads who came from the sky long long ago. And to this day, locals live in fear of attack from strange-looking creatures from above.\nAnd there is more. In 1947, British scientist Karyl Robin-Evans led an expedition into the mountains and discovered a group of dwarfs  who called themselves the Droza. \"They told him that their ancestors came from a planet in the Sirius system and crashed in this mountain area a long time ago,\" writes Hausdorf, \"Many of them were killed, but survivors adapted to living on this rough planet far from home.\"\nFor decades, Robin-Evans' claims were dismissed as nonsense. But in 1995, the Associated Press reported that in the region a village named Huilong had been discovered--populated by 120 dwarfs ranging from 3-foot-10 to 2-foot-1tall.Hausdorf asks, \"Could these people be the last living descendants of the survivors of the legendary UGO crash--the Chinese Roswell?\"",
