  "article": "Canyoning  \nThe sports of canyoning explore the high-energy environment where water meets rock on the coast, or in river canyons. Protected by wetsuits and helmets  , people jump from cliffs   and waterfalls and explore caves and river canyons that would not normally be arrived at.\nIt was pioneered in the U.K. by TYF Adventure (01437 721611, www.tyf.com) and several thousand people leap from the cliffs near St David's each year. A half day canyoning trip costs PS50 (PS30 for children under 16).\nScuba diving\nDiving is not popular with British people. The challenges of wild waters are greater because the water is colder and not clear enough, but the coasts of Cornwall, Wales and Scotland have some of the best wreck diving in the world.\nThe British Sub Aqua Club (0870 112 9133 www.bsac.com) and the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (01580 819688 www.padi.com) run courses teaching the important skills right up and to instructor level.\nSurfing\nThe best surfing places in the UK are on the southwest coast where it is warmer and the surf is relatively steady, particularly in Cornwall. The best time of year to surf in the UK is late summer and autumn when water temperatures are at their mildest.\nThe British Surfing Association (01479 861256 www.britsurf.co.uk) has a list of famous surf schools around the country.\nRock climbing\nThe most popular natural rocks in Britain include the Peak District, the Lake District, coastal regions, while vast areas of Scotland are a climber's paradise  . Climbing courses and climbing walls can be located on the website of the British Mountaineering Council (0870 010 4878, www.thebmc.co.uk) which offers a series of short films that take the new climber through a step-by-step guide to visiting a climbing wall for the first time.",
