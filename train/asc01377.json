  "article": "OSLO -- Excited with pride, Norwegians sang in the streets of Oslo on Sunday, celebrating Norway's National Day and the country's Eurovision Song Contest victory.\nHundreds of Norwegians sang along to Alexander Rybak's winning song Fairytale as they walked in the country's traditional National Day parade   celebrating the Norwegian constitution.\nAlexander Rybak -- called \"Alexander the Great\" by the Norwegian media -- won a great victory in the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) by gaining the most votes in its 53-year history in Moscow on Saturday.\nAlexander has played violin and piano since he was five years old, and he also composes his own music and sings. In 2006 he won the Norwegian talent show Kjempesjansen with his own song Foolin. Alexander has performed with one of the world's most celebrated violinists, Pinchas Zukerman, won the Anders Jahres Culture Price and has been the concertmaster for Norway's largest symphony orchestra   for youths, Ung Symfoni.\nNorwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said there was clearly something special about the 23-year-old and his folk music. \"This is a _ performance by a young and talented musician,\" Stoltenberg said in a statement.\nRybak is expected to draw a large crowd of fans to Oslo's Gardermoen airport when he arrives next Sunday, after having invited all his countrymen from the stage in Moscow.\nWith Rybak's win, Norway will host next year's Eurovision finals, a show that reaches a television audience of over 100 million people. Norway's Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, promised that Norway would put on a splendid show next year but without spending as much as Moscow, which spent 24 million euros this year. \"I don't think that is necessary,\" he told national broadcaster NRK.\nThe win was Norway's third. The Nordic country also won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1985 and 1995.",
