  "article": "Many of us are used to hearing stories of people being pickpocketed in busy places. But most of us are aware of the dangers, so we are safe - at least, we think we are.\nAccording to a BBC report, a growing number of thieves are trying to \"hack   our mind's weaknesses\" to get their hands on our possessions.\n\"In fact, the key requirement for a successful pickpocket isn't having quick fingers,\" said the report. By using psychology, some pickpockets are taking advantage of the loopholes  in our brains.\nOur lack of ability to multitask is one of the most important loopholes used by pickpockets, the report explains. While this can often be a good trait , allowing us to focus on the most important details in our surroundings, \"a good trickster can use it against you, \" said neuroscientist Auzana Martinez-Conde.\n\"It's all about directing people's attention toward something else,\" said James Brown, who studies the tricks of pickpocketing. Confidence, the power of suggestion, and certain hand movements such as moving your hands in an arc   are all said to be things that fool us.\nGroups of pickpockets use a common trick designed to create a scene and confuse victims.\nThe first gang member, a \"blocker\", walks in front of the victim and suddenly bumps into them. A second member of the gang then bumps into both of them from behind and stages an argument with the \"blocker\". In the confusion, both men steal what they can and pass it to a third thief who quickly runs off with the stolen goods.\nSome thieves go even further to exploit our psychology by hanging out near signs reading \"beware of pickpockets\". Since this is one of the last places people expect to be robbed, many check where their valuables are, giving away their location to thieves.\nBut according to Brown, as long as we don't daydream in public, we shouldn't be worried.\n\"A street thief will avoid like the plague \" people who are demonstrating a very open awareness of their environment,\" he said.",
