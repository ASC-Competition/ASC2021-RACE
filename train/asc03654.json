  "article": "Team building games can be fun for teenagers. They can also be tools for strengthening the group. There are many levels of team building exercises. Let's look at some activities that can help you build a stronger team.\nPass the Clap\nPass the Clap works well as a beginning activity to help your group get to know each other. Have the participants stand in a circle. One person starts the clap and then turns to face the person next to him. As they are about to make eye contact, they clap together. That next person now has the clap and he has to pass it on. Continue to pass the clap around the circle.\nBlindfolded Birthday\nBlindfolded Birthday works well after people have become a little more familiar with each other. Everyone puts on a blindfold. Then, without talking, they have to line up in order of birthdays.\nTwo Truths and a Lie\nTwo truths and a Lie can be played anytime in the group's operations. Have the participants sit in a circle. Each person is supposed to tell two truths and a lie about themselves. The group has to guess which is the lie.\nHuman Knot\nHuman Knot is an activity best played after your group has gotten quite familiar with each other, because there can be a lot of touching going on. Everyone gathers in a circle. They put their right hands in the middle of the circle. They grab someone else's hand. Then the left hands go in the middle and they grab someone else's hand. The group is now knotted up. The object of Human Knot is to untie the group without letting go of any hands.",
