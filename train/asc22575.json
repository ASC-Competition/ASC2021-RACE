  "article": "The big red American car was much too wide for an English country road. When Jack saw it running towards him, he stopped his own car at the side of the road to make room for it to pass. The American car went slowly past, so close that he could see the driver's face clearly.\n\"Where have I seen that face before?\" he though. \"Wait a minute! I remember now. It was in the newspaper!\" He took all the newspapers from his bag and turned quickly to the middle page. There was a picture of the face in it. Yes, it had a large mouth and small eyes, and his eyes were behind dark glasses.\n\"Wanted by the police,\" read by Jack. \"The city Bank will give a lot of money to anyone who helps the police to catch this man.\"\n\"Call the police at once,\" he said to himself. But a few minutes later, he was sad. \"This man was caught this morning,\"  answered the police.",
