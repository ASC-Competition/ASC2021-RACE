  "article": "There was a bookseller .He did not like to pay for anything.One day a big box of books fell on his foot.\n\"Go to the doctor,\" said his wife,\"and show that foot to him.\"\n\"No,\"he said,\"I'll wait until the doctor comes to our shop next time.Then I'll ask him about my foot.If I go to see him,I will have to pay.\"\nThe next day the doctor came to the shop to buy some books.The bookseller told the doctor about his bad foot.The doctor looked at it and promised to help.He took out a piece of paper and wrote something on it.\"Buy this medicine and put it on the foot before you go to bed every night,\"he said.\n\"Thank you,\"said the bookseller,\"And now,sir,here are your books.\"\n\"How much?\" asked the doctor.\n\"Two pounds.\"\" Oh,good,\"said the doctor.\"I won't have to pay you anything today.\"\n\"Why?\" asked the bookseller.\n\"I look over your foot.I will not pay two pounds for that.If people come to my house,l ask them to pay only one pound for a small thing like that.But when I go to their house,I usually charge two pounds.And I came here today,didn't I? Bye--bye!\"",
